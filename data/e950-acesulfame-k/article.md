At a glance
- Also called / E-number: Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), E950
- What it does: High-intensity sweetener; adds sweetness without sugar or calories
- Common in: Diet sodas, sugar-free gum, flavored waters, tabletop sweeteners, protein drinks, light syrups, yogurt, desserts, and baked goods
- Diet flags: Calorie-free; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets; gluten-free; check labels for kosher or halal certification if needed

1) Why it’s added to food
- It provides sweetness without sugar or calories.  
- It is heat-stable and shelf-stable, so it works in baking and pasteurized drinks.  
- It is often blended with other sweeteners (like sucralose or aspartame) to improve taste.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Diet and “zero” soft drinks, flavored seltzers, energy drinks, and ready-to-drink teas.  
- Sugar-free gum and mints; “light” or “reduced-sugar” yogurt; gelatin desserts and puddings.  
- Protein shakes, flavored milks, bakery items, and tabletop sweetener packets.  
Shopping tips:
- Check labels for “Acesulfame potassium,” “Acesulfame K,” or “Ace-K.”  
- If you want to avoid it, look for “no artificial sweeteners” or choose unsweetened options.

3) What are its alternatives
- Other high-intensity sweeteners: sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, neotame, advantame.  
- Plant-derived options: stevia leaf extracts (steviol glycosides), monk fruit extract.  
- Low-/no-calorie bulk sweeteners: allulose, erythritol, xylitol (note: sugar alcohols can cause GI upset in some people).  
- Traditional sweeteners: sugar, honey, maple syrup (add calories and sugar).  
Shopping tip: If you prefer fewer additives, pick “unsweetened” versions and sweeten at home to taste.

4) How Acesulfame K is manufactured
- It is made by a chemical process. Manufacturers react acetoacetic acid derivatives with sulfamic acid to form the sweet compound, then neutralize it with potassium to make the potassium salt (acesulfame K).  
- The product is purified and crystallized to a high standard for food use.

5) How safe is Acesulfame K for consumption?
- Regulatory bodies have reviewed safety data and allow its use under set rules and limits.  
- Acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) help ensure typical intake stays well below levels of concern.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It can help reduce added sugar and calories when it replaces sugar in foods and drinks.  
- It does not contribute to tooth decay.  
Shopping tip: To cut sugar, choose products sweetened with Ace-K or other low-/no-calorie sweeteners, or pick unsweetened items.

7) When Acesulfame K may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Some people prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners. If you notice taste issues or sensitivity, choose versions without Ace-K.  
- For young children, professional groups suggest limiting nonnutritive sweeteners; choose water, milk, and unsweetened foods when possible.  
- If you have specific medical conditions or dietary needs, ask a healthcare professional about your overall sweetener use.
