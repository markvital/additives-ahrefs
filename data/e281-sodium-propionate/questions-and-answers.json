      "q": "is sodium propionate bad for you",
      "a": "Generally no: it’s a permitted preservative (GRAS in the U.S.; approved in the EU) with low toxicity at typical food levels. High amounts may cause stomach upset and add sodium, and people with the rare disorder propionic acidemia may need to limit it.",

      "q": "\"what is the ph of a 0.26 m solution of sodium propionate\"",
      "a": "About pH 9.1 at 25°C (it’s the salt of a weak acid, so its solution is mildly basic).",

      "q": "5. sodium acetate and sodium propionate are poor soaps. why",
      "a": "Because they’re salts of very short‑chain fatty acids (C2 and C3), they’re too water‑soluble to act as effective surfactants and don’t form stable micelles, so they clean and foam poorly.",

    {
      "q": "how do sodium benzoate and sodium propionate keep yeast and fungus from growing?",
      "a": "They act as weak‑acid preservatives: in acidic foods the undissociated acid enters cells, acidifies the cytoplasm, and disrupts energy metabolism and enzyme function, inhibiting yeasts and molds. Benzoate works best below about pH 4.5; propionate is especially effective against molds in baked goods at mildly acidic pH.",

    {
      "q": "how much sodium propionate in baking",
      "a": "Typically about 0.1–0.3% of flour weight (≈1–3 g per kg flour) under good manufacturing practice to inhibit mold; higher levels can affect yeast activity and flavor. Check local regulations for permitted maxima.",
