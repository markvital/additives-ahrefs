Sodium erythorbate (E316) is an antioxidant used to keep foods tasting and looking fresh. It is best known for helping cured meats keep their pink color and for speeding the curing process, especially when used with nitrite. It is widely authorized by food safety agencies for these roles.

## At a glance

- What it does: antioxidant and curing accelerator; helps prevent off-flavors, browning, and color loss.
- Where it’s used: most common in cured meats like bacon, ham, and hot dogs; also appears in some canned or pickled foods and beverages.
- How it shows on labels: “sodium erythorbate,” “E316,” or “sodium isoascorbate.”
- Related to vitamin C: it’s a close chemical cousin of ascorbic acid but does not count as vitamin C in the diet.
- Solubility and stability: water‑soluble and effective in both cold and cooked foods.

## Why is sodium erythorbate added to food?

Sodium erythorbate protects food from oxidation. Oxidation can dull color, create rancid or “stale” notes, and destroy sensitive nutrients. By donating electrons, this additive slows those reactions and helps foods keep their fresh taste and color. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) lists E316 as an antioxidant authorized for use in many foods for these purposes.[^1]

In cured meats, sodium erythorbate works with [sodium nitrite](/e250-sodium-nitrite) to speed curing and stabilize the rosy cured color. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA‑FSIS) requires sodium erythorbate or [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) in pumped bacon to help inhibit the formation of nitrosamines—unwanted compounds that can form when bacon is fried at high heat.[^2]

## What foods contain sodium erythorbate?

You’ll most often see E316 in:
- Cured meats: bacon, ham, deli meats, corned beef, and hot dogs
- Some canned, pickled, or bottled foods where color and flavor need protection
- Certain beverages and prepared potato products to limit browning

In the U.S., pumped bacon specifically must include either sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate as part of the curing system.[^2]

## What can replace sodium erythorbate?

Depending on the recipe and rules for the product, common stand‑ins include:
- [Sodium ascorbate (E301)](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) or [ascorbic acid (E300)](/e300-ascorbic-acid) for similar antioxidant and curing effects
- [Extracts of rosemary (E392)](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary) as a natural antioxidant in fats and oils
- [Citric acid (E330)](/e330-citric-acid) to help control browning and stabilize flavor in some foods
- [Sorbic acid (E200)](/e200-sorbic-acid) for antimicrobial action when spoilage by molds or yeasts is the main concern

No single substitute fits every product; food makers often test blends to match both performance and labeling goals.

## How is sodium erythorbate made?

Sodium erythorbate is the sodium salt of erythorbic acid (also called isoascorbic acid). It is typically produced from sugars such as glucose through fermentation and chemical steps to form erythorbic acid, which is then neutralized with a sodium base to yield the final, water‑soluble salt.[^1] In foods, it functions as an antioxidant rather than as a vitamin.

## Is sodium erythorbate safe to eat?

Food safety agencies in the U.S. and EU have evaluated E316. EFSA’s re‑evaluation concluded there was no safety concern for the reported uses and use levels in foods.[^1] In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium erythorbate as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3] For identity and function, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) PubChem database also recognizes sodium erythorbate as an antioxidant and the sodium salt of erythorbic acid.[^4]

## Does sodium erythorbate have any benefits?

- Helps foods keep their intended color and flavor by slowing oxidation
- Stabilizes cured meat color and speeds the curing process when used with nitrite
- In bacon processed under U.S. rules, it is part of the system designed to reduce nitrosamine formation during high‑heat cooking[^2]

These benefits are technological—you won’t get vitamin C from E316, even though it is closely related to ascorbic acid.

## Who should avoid sodium erythorbate?

- People on strict low‑sodium diets may choose to watch total sodium from all sources, though the amount from E316 in foods is usually small.
- If your doctor or dietitian has advised you to avoid certain curing agents or processed meats, follow that guidance.
- Allergic reactions to sodium erythorbate are uncommon; if you suspect sensitivity, consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “It’s just another name for MSG.” Fact: Sodium erythorbate is an antioxidant; [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) is a flavor enhancer. They are different ingredients.
- Myth: “It’s a red dye.” Fact: E316 does not add color; it helps protect existing color by reducing oxidation in foods like cured meats.
- Myth: “It’s a source of vitamin C.” Fact: Although it is a close chemical cousin of vitamin C, your body does not use sodium erythorbate as vitamin C.

## sodium erythorbate in branded foods

On ingredient lists, look for “sodium erythorbate” or “E316,” usually near the end of the list because it is used in small amounts. You’ll most commonly find it in branded bacon, ham, hot dogs, and sliced deli meats, and occasionally in canned or pickled items and some beverages where manufacturers want to keep flavor and color stable over shelf life.
