At a glance
- Also called/E-number: E164 (saffron); note: E-numbers are EU/UK identifiers and may not appear on U.S. labels.
- What it does: Colors foods yellow-gold; adds aroma and flavor; antioxidant activity.
- Common in: Rice mixes, bouillon, soups, desserts, specialty beverages, spice blends.
- Diet flags: Plant-based, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free by nature; check for adulteration in low-quality products.

1) Why it's added to food
- Saffron is added to give a deep yellow color and a distinct aroma. It can also act as a natural antioxidant in foods.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You’ll see it in Spanish-style or “yellow” rice mixes, bouillon or soup bases, seafood seasonings, and some desserts and beverages. Specialty ice creams, baked goods, and teas may also use saffron or saffron extract.
- Shopping tip: Check labels for “saffron,” “saffron extract,” or “spice and coloring.”

3) What are its alternatives
- For color only, common swaps include turmeric, annatto, or paprika/oleoresin paprika. These give warm yellow to orange tones but different flavors.
- If you need similar golden color with a very mild flavor, safflower (sometimes sold as “Mexican saffron”) can substitute for color. For a paella-like color without saffron’s price, look for rice mixes colored with turmeric or annatto.

4) How saffron is manufactured
- Saffron threads are the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus flowers, hand-harvested and gently dried. This labor-intensive process explains the high price.
- For processed uses, manufacturers may make water or ethanol extracts and standardize to natural crocin pigments and related compounds.

5) How safe is saffron for consumption?
- Bottom line: Culinary use of saffron as a spice and color is generally recognized as safe when used as intended. In the U.S., saffron is a color additive exempt from certification and permitted in foods.
- Always follow good manufacturing and labeling practices. High-dose supplements are a different use-case than cooking amounts.
