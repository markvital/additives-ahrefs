## At a glance
- **Also called / E-number:** saffron; E164

- **Common in:** foods where a warm yellow color is desired  
- **Diet flags:** plant‑derived (from Crocus sativus)  

## Why is saffron added to food?
Saffron is added to give foods a yellow‑orange color and a consistent appearance. U.S. FDA lists saffron as a color additive permitted for use in foods, and the EU authorizes it as E 164 under the food additive rules.[^1][^5] If you want to spot it, look on ingredient lists for “saffron” in the U.S. or for “colour: saffron (E 164)” on EU‑style labels.[^5]

## What foods contain saffron?
Saffron shows up in a range of packaged and prepared foods where a natural yellow color is desired. Check ingredient lists for “saffron” or, in the EU, for “colour: saffron (E 164).”[^5] If you prefer to skip added colors, choose products that don’t list color additives or that simply use their natural color.

## What can replace saffron?
Other natural yellows can stand in when only color (not saffron’s distinct flavor) is needed. Options include turmeric/curcumin (/e100-curcumin), annatto (/e160b-annatto), paprika extract (/e160c-paprika-extract), or beta‑carotene (/e160a-beta-carotene). These can be more cost‑effective, but they give different shades and won’t provide saffron’s aroma or taste.

## How is saffron made?
Saffron color comes from hand‑harvested flower stigmas that are carefully dried. In the EU, E 164 “saffron” is defined and specified as the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., with identity and purity criteria laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

## Is saffron safe to eat?
Regulators consider saffron a permitted food color when used as directed. In the U.S., FDA lists saffron among color additives permitted for use in food; in the EU, it appears in the Union list of authorized food additives as E 164.[^1][^5]
- Authorized in U.S. foods as a color additive exempt from certification (still regulated by FDA).[^1]
- Authorized in the EU as E 164 with specifications in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3][^5]
- Labels must declare food additives, typically by name in the U.S. and by functional class plus name or E‑number in the EU.[^5]

## Does saffron have any benefits?
For food makers and cooks, the main benefit is stable yellow‑orange color for consistent product appearance. FDA explains that color additives are used to add or restore color so foods look as expected.[^2] If you want saffron’s flavor too, note that color‑only substitutes won’t replicate it.

## Who should avoid saffron?
If you avoid added colors, choose foods without color additives or look for products that don’t list saffron or E 164. In the EU, additives appear in the ingredient list by function (“colour”) and specific name or E‑number, which makes them easier to spot.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E164 is a synthetic dye.” Fact: E 164 saffron is plant‑derived from the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., per EU specifications.[^3]
- Myth: “E‑numbers mean an ingredient is unsafe.” Fact: E‑numbers identify additives that are authorized for use in the EU under Regulation 1333/2008.[^5]
- Myth: “Saffron coloring isn’t regulated in the U.S.” Fact: FDA regulates saffron as a color additive permitted for use in foods (exempt from certification but still subject to FDA oversight).[^1]

## Saffron in Branded Foods
You’ll mainly see saffron in specialty items that aim for a natural warm yellow color, such as premium spice blends or prepared dishes where saffron’s color is part of the appeal. Ingredient lists will show “saffron,” and EU‑market products may list “colour: saffron (E 164).”[^5]
