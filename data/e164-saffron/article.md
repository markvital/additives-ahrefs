Saffron (E 164) is a natural yellow‑orange color made from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower. It also adds a distinct aroma and flavor, so it’s used sparingly in foods and drinks. In the EU it’s an approved food color with official specifications.

## Why is saffron added to food?
It’s added to give a warm yellow‑orange color and a saffron aroma in very small amounts. In the EU, saffron is approved as a food color (E 164) with detailed purity specifications, so manufacturers can use it where a natural color is desired.[^1] On EU labels, look for “colour: saffron” or “colour: E 164.”[^2]

## What foods contain saffron?
You’ll mostly see saffron in specialty or traditional foods and drinks that highlight its color and aroma. Think seasoned rice, sweet buns and cakes, confectionery and desserts, sauces or soups, and certain liqueurs. In the EU, check labels for “colour: saffron” or “E 164”; in the U.S., it may appear simply as “saffron” in the ingredient list.[^2]

## What can replace saffron?
Other approved colors can give a similar yellow hue, but they won’t match saffron’s aroma. Common stand‑ins include [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) (bright yellow), [annatto](/e160b-annatto) (yellow‑orange, often used in cheeses), [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) (orange‑red), and [beta‑carotene](/e160a-beta-carotene) (yellow‑orange). These usually cost less and have milder or different flavors, so the taste profile changes.

## How is saffron made?
Saffron color comes from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus L. flower, which are hand‑harvested, dried, and used whole or ground. Its main coloring principles are crocins and crocetin, and EU specifications set identity and purity criteria for food‑use saffron.[^3]

## Is saffron safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended in food, saffron is considered safe by major regulators. In the U.S., saffron is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) as a spice when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^4] In the EU, saffron (E 164) is an authorized color additive with specifications and oversight by EU authorities.[^5]
- EU specifications for E 164 (saffron) are established in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1]
- In the U.S., saffron is listed among GRAS spices at 21 CFR 182.10.[^4]
- EU ingredient lists must name additives by function and specific name or E‑number (for example, “colour: saffron” or “colour: E 164”).[^2]

## Does saffron have any benefits?
Its benefit in foods is technical and sensory: it provides a natural yellow‑orange color and a saffron aroma. Color additives are used to make foods look consistent and appealing; they’re not added for nutrition.[^6]

## Who should avoid saffron?
Most people don’t need to avoid saffron used at normal food levels. If you prefer to skip it, scan EU labels for “colour: saffron” or “E 164” so you can choose products without it.[^7]
