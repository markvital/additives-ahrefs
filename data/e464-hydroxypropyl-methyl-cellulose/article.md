Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), also called hypromellose, is a plant‑derived cellulose ether used to thicken, stabilize, and emulsify foods. It helps hold water, improve texture, and keep sauces, desserts, and baked goods stable during storage and cooking. It is listed in Europe as E464.

## At a glance
- What it is: a modified cellulose from plant fiber that works as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier.
- What it does in food: builds body, prevents separation, improves freeze–thaw stability, and helps films and foams hold.
- Where you’ll see it: gluten‑free breads and doughs, plant‑based meats and dairy alternatives, sauces, desserts, and capsules for supplements.
- Label names: “hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose,” “hypromellose,” “HPMC,” or “E464.”

## Why is Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose added to food?
Food makers add HPMC to control texture and stability. It thickens liquids, stabilizes emulsions (so oil and water stay mixed), suspends particles, and helps retain moisture during baking and freezing. In gluten‑free doughs, it replaces some of gluten’s binding and gas‑holding functions to improve rise and crumb. In frozen treats and sauces, it reduces ice crystal growth and separation for a smoother result. These are approved technological uses in both the U.S. and EU.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose?
You may find HPMC in:
- Gluten‑free breads, tortillas, pizza dough, and noodles
- Plant‑based burgers, sausages, and deli slices
- Non‑dairy milks, yogurts, whipped toppings, and cheese analogues
- Sauces, dressings, gravies, and dips
- Puddings, custards, pie fillings, and instant dessert mixes
- Ice cream and other frozen desserts
- Seasoning blends and drink mixes (to control flow and dispersion)

On labels, look for “hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose,” “hypromellose,” “HPMC,” or “E464.”

## What can replace Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose?
Possible alternatives depend on the job:
- Thickening and body: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [agar](/e406-agar), [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- Gelation/structure in hot processing: [methyl cellulose](/e461-methyl-cellulose)
- Stabilizing dairy and non‑dairy systems: [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum)

No single substitute matches HPMC in every recipe, so blends are common.

## How is Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose made?
HPMC is produced from purified cellulose (plant fiber). The cellulose is first treated with a mild alkali to form “alkali cellulose,” then reacted with methyl chloride and propylene oxide. This adds small methoxy and hydroxypropyl groups along the cellulose chain. The product is washed and purified to remove salts and residual reagents, then dried and milled to a fine powder.[^1][^2]

## Is Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. and EU authorize HPMC for use in foods, subject to purity and use conditions.[^1][^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated cellulose ethers, including HPMC (E464), and concluded there is no safety concern for their use at the reported levels in food.[^3] Like other cellulose derivatives, HPMC is not absorbed intact; high amounts may soften stools or cause gas in some people due to its bulking effect.[^3]

## Does Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose have any benefits?
- Texture and quality: helps create smooth, stable sauces and creamy desserts.
- Better baking: supports dough structure in gluten‑free recipes and reduces staling by holding moisture.
- Freeze–thaw stability: helps limit ice crystal growth for smoother frozen foods.
- Plant‑based formulation: provides structure and bite in vegan meats and cheeses without animal ingredients.

## Who should avoid Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose?
Most people do not need to avoid HPMC. Those who notice digestive discomfort (such as gas or loose stools) after eating products high in cellulose gums may prefer to limit them. If your doctor has advised a restricted‑fiber diet, ask whether cellulose derivatives like HPMC fit your plan. HPMC is suitable for vegetarians and vegans because it is plant‑derived.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “HPMC is plastic.”  
  Fact: HPMC is a modified plant cellulose. It does not contain plastic; it is a carbohydrate polymer similar to natural dietary fiber.[^2]
- Myth: “It isn’t allowed in major markets.”  
  Fact: HPMC is authorized for use in foods in both the EU (as E464) and the U.S., with specifications and conditions of use.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “HPMC is the same as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).”  
  Fact: They are different cellulose ethers with different side groups and performance; formulators choose based on the needed function.[^2]

## Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in branded foods
You can spot HPMC on ingredient lists for many mainstream products in these categories: gluten‑free bakery goods, plant‑based meats and cheeses, spoonable and pourable dressings, and frozen desserts. On packs, look for “hypromellose,” “hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose,” “HPMC,” or “E464.” Retailers and brands may adjust recipes over time, so always check the current label.
