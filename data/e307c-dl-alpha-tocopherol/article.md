DL-Alpha-tocopherol (E307c) is a synthetic form of vitamin E used mainly as an antioxidant to protect fats and oils from going rancid. It helps keep flavor, color, and nutrients stable, and can also contribute vitamin E to the diet depending on how much is used.

## At a glance
- What it is: The synthetic, racemic form of alpha‑tocopherol (vitamin E), often labeled “dl‑alpha‑tocopherol” or “all‑rac‑alpha‑tocopherol.”
- What it does: Antioxidant that slows oxidation in fatty foods and oils.
- Common in: Vegetable oils, snack foods, spreads, dressings, and fortified products.
- E‑number family: Related to [alpha‑tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol) (E307), [d‑alpha‑tocopherol](/e307a-d-alpha-tocopherol) (E307a), and [tocopherol‑rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) (E306).
- Origin: Produced by chemical synthesis; not derived from animals.

## Why is DL-Alpha-tocopherol added to food?
Food makers add dl‑alpha‑tocopherol to slow the oxidation of fats and oils, which helps prevent off‑flavors, rancidity, and nutrient loss. It functions as an antioxidant and is permitted for use in foods under good manufacturing practice in the United States.[^1]

## What foods contain DL-Alpha-tocopherol?
You are most likely to see dl‑alpha‑tocopherol in foods that contain significant fat, such as cooking oils, nut butters, cereal bars, snacks, baked goods, salad dressings, and spreads. It may also appear in fortified foods and beverages that add vitamin E. Its use level depends on the product and local regulations.[^1]

## What can replace DL-Alpha-tocopherol?
Depending on the food and the goal, common alternatives include:
- Other antioxidants like [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha) and [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene).
- Fat‑soluble options such as [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate).
- Natural extracts like [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary).
- Helper acids that improve antioxidant performance, such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- Other tocopherol forms, including [alpha‑tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), [d‑alpha‑tocopherol](/e307a-d-alpha-tocopherol), or [tocopherol‑rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract).

## How is DL-Alpha-tocopherol made?
DL‑alpha‑tocopherol (also called all‑rac‑alpha‑tocopherol) is produced by chemical synthesis. A common route couples trimethylhydroquinone with isophytol, followed by finishing steps to yield the antioxidant vitamin E compound. This synthetic process makes a mixture of stereoisomers, hence the “dl” designation.[^2]

## Is DL-Alpha-tocopherol safe to eat?
Yes. Tocopherols are permitted for use in foods in the U.S. as antioxidants under good manufacturing practice, meaning manufacturers must use the minimum amount needed for the intended effect.[^1] In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated tocopherols (E306–E309) and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels as food additives.[^2]

## Does DL-Alpha-tocopherol have any benefits?
In foods, it helps keep fats fresh and protects flavor and color. In the body, alpha‑tocopherol acts as a fat‑soluble antioxidant that helps protect cells from oxidative damage; it is the main form of vitamin E maintained in the blood and tissues.[^3] The additive typically contributes only small amounts of vitamin E compared with dietary supplements, but it can add to overall intake depending on how much is present in the food.[^3]

## Who should avoid DL-Alpha-tocopherol?
- People taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicines (such as warfarin) should be cautious with high‑dose vitamin E supplements because of a potential increased bleeding risk; consult a healthcare professional. This concern relates to supplement‑level intakes, not the small amounts used as food additives.[^3]
- Anyone with a diagnosed sensitivity to a carrier oil or ingredient in the specific product should read labels carefully.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Synthetic dl‑alpha‑tocopherol isn’t vitamin E.” Fact: It is a form of vitamin E with antioxidant activity; the “dl” simply indicates a synthetic mixture of isomers.
- Myth: “If it’s synthetic, it must be unsafe.” Fact: EFSA found no safety concern for tocopherols at reported food‑use levels, and they are permitted under U.S. good manufacturing practice.[^2]
- Myth: “It always comes from soy.” Fact: The dl form is made by chemical synthesis; products may still use various carrier oils, so labels are the best guide.

## DL-Alpha-tocopherol in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for names such as “dl‑alpha‑tocopherol,” “all‑rac‑alpha‑tocopherol,” “vitamin E,” “tocopherol (antioxidant),” or “antioxidant (E307c).” You’ll commonly see it on bottles of cooking oil, in nut and seed products, cereal and snack bars, chips and crackers, ready‑to‑eat cereals, dressings, mayonnaise and spreads, and some fortified drinks.
