Calcium salts of fatty acids (E470AIII) are common food additives that help ingredients mix, keep textures stable, and stop powders from clumping. You will often see them listed as “calcium stearate” or “calcium palmitate,” and they are used in very small amounts across many foods. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow their use under good manufacturing practice.

## At a glance
- E-number: E470AIII; functional classes: emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener
- Typical names on labels: calcium stearate, calcium palmitate, calcium salts of fatty acids
- What it does: helps oil and water mix, improves texture, prevents sticking and caking
- Where found: baked goods and mixes, powdered drinks, confectionery, seasonings, and supplements
- Source note: can be made from animal fats or vegetable oils; check with the manufacturer for dietary preferences
- Regulatory status: permitted in the EU (E470a group) and the U.S. when made and used as specified

## Why are calcium salts of fatty acids added to food?
They help fats and water blend smoothly (emulsifying) and keep that blend stable during shelf life (stabilising). They also act as anti-caking and release agents, so powders flow better and foods are less likely to stick to equipment.[^2] These uses are recognized in both EU and U.S. regulations.[^1]

## What foods contain calcium salts of fatty acids?
You can find E470AIII across many categories, usually in tiny amounts:
- Bakery items and dry mixes (for flow and texture)
- Confectionery and chocolate (for smoothness and release)
- Powdered drinks, creamers, and instant products (to reduce caking)
- Seasonings and spice blends (to keep free-flowing)
- Food supplements and tablets (as a lubricant in compression)

Global standards list permitted uses of salts of fatty acids in many processed food categories, which reflects their broad, technical role.[^4]

## What can replace calcium salts of fatty acids?
Depending on the job needed, common alternatives include:
- Emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Stabilizers/thickeners: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- Related stearates: [magnesium stearate](/e572-magnesium-stearate) or the broader group [sodium, potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids](/e470a-sodium-potassium-and-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids)

The best substitute depends on the food, process, and labeling needs.

## How is calcium salts of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers typically react edible fatty acids (often stearic or palmitic acid from food-grade fats and oils) with a calcium source such as calcium hydroxide. The result is a calcium “soap” of the fatty acid (for example, calcium stearate), which is then refined to meet purity specifications for food use.[^1] In the EU, E470a (which includes the calcium salts) must meet detailed identity and purity criteria set out in the additive specifications.[^2]

## Is calcium salts of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes, when produced from approved edible sources and used within good manufacturing practice, regulators consider these additives safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits “salts of fatty acids,” including calcium types, as multipurpose food additives, and separately recognizes calcium stearate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).[^1][^3] In the EU, E470a (sodium, potassium, and calcium salts of fatty acids) is authorized with specifications under additive rules.[^2]

## Does calcium salts of fatty acids have any benefits?
In foods, it helps:
- Keep textures stable and consistent over shelf life
- Improve flow and reduce clumping in powders
- Reduce sticking to equipment and molds, improving production

These functions can make products more reliable and easier to manufacture, with minimal impact on taste or nutrition.[^2]

## Who should avoid calcium salts of fatty acids?
- Strict vegetarians and vegans may wish to check the source, because the fatty acids can come from animal fats or vegetable oils. Many suppliers offer plant-based grades; labeling or the manufacturer can confirm.
- People under special medical advice to limit certain ingredients should follow their clinician’s guidance. Typical use levels are very small.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a soap, so it isn’t food.” These are food-grade calcium salts of edible fatty acids, used in tiny amounts for technical effects and permitted by regulators.[^1][^2]
- “It’s a filler that dilutes food.” Its role is functional (emulsifying, stabilizing, anti-caking), not to bulk up products; the added amounts are usually very low.[^2]
- “It always comes from animal fat.” Not necessarily; sources can be plant or animal. Many products specify vegetarian or vegan sources when relevant.

## Calcium salts of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you may see:
- “Calcium stearate”
- “Calcium palmitate”
- “Calcium salts of fatty acids”
- “E470a (calcium)”

They appear in small amounts, mainly to help texture, mixing, or manufacturing.
