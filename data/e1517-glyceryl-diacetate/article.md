Glyceryl diacetate (E1517), also called diacetin, is an ester made from glycerol and acetic acid. Food makers use it mainly as a mild, neutral-tasting solvent and moisture keeper to help flavors mix and textures stay soft.

## At a glance
- What it is: an ester of glycerol and acetic acid, usually a mix of the 1,2- and 1,3- isomers (diacetin).
- What it does: works as a solvent/carrier for flavors and colors, and as a humectant to help foods hold moisture.
- Where you might see it: flavor preparations, confectionery, chewing gum bases, icings, and other foods that need moisture control or a flavor carrier.
- Labeling: in the EU it may appear as “glyceryl diacetate” or “E1517.”
- Oversight: approved in the European Union with detailed identity and purity specifications.

## Why is Glyceryl diacetate added to food?
Manufacturers add glyceryl diacetate because it dissolves flavor compounds and some color ingredients that do not mix well with water or fat. It also helps retain moisture, which can keep certain foods soft and stable during shelf life. In the European Union, it is authorized as a food additive under the E-number E1517, with specific specifications and conditions of use set by law.[^2]

## What foods contain Glyceryl diacetate?
You’re most likely to find glyceryl diacetate in products where a solvent or moisture keeper is useful. These include flavor preparations used in beverages and candies, soft confectionery, chewing gum base, and dessert toppings or icings. On ingredient lists in the EU, it may be declared by its class name (such as “humectant” or “solvent”) followed by “glyceryl diacetate” or “E1517.”[^5]

Related ingredients that may appear alongside or instead of glyceryl diacetate include [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) (E422), [glyceryl triacetate](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate) (triacetin, E1518), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) (E420), and [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol) (E1520).

## What can replace Glyceryl diacetate?
- For dissolving flavors: [glyceryl triacetate](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate) (E1518) or [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol) (E1520) are common alternatives.
- For moisture retention: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) (E422) or [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) (E420) can serve similar roles.
- For emulsification plus carrying flavors: [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids) (E475) may be used, depending on the application.

The best substitute depends on flavor solubility, sweetness, labeling goals, and local regulations.

## How is Glyceryl diacetate made?
Glyceryl diacetate is produced by reacting glycerol with acetic acid or acetic anhydride (a process called esterification). The result is mainly a mixture of the 1,2- and 1,3-diacetate isomers; small amounts of mono- and triacetates may also form, which are limited by the specification.[^1] The final product is purified to meet defined identity and purity criteria, including limits on residual substances and contaminants.[^1]

## Is Glyceryl diacetate safe to eat?
In the European Union, E1517 is an authorized food additive. That means it must meet strict identity and purity specifications and can be used only under the conditions laid down in the Union list of approved additives.[^2] The specifications include limits on impurities and define the substance precisely, helping ensure consistent safety and quality.[^1]

In the United States, glyceryl diacetate is permitted as a component in certain food-contact adhesives, which indicates additional oversight for materials that may indirectly contact foods.[^4] As with all additives and food-contact substances, manufacturers are required to use it according to good manufacturing practice.

## Does Glyceryl diacetate have any benefits?
- Technology: It dissolves flavor compounds and some colorants, helping deliver consistent taste and appearance.
- Quality: As a humectant, it helps foods stay soft and reduces drying out.
- Formulation: It is neutral in taste and compatible with many flavor systems, which makes it useful in low-dose applications.

These are functional benefits in processing and product quality rather than health benefits.

## Who should avoid Glyceryl diacetate?
- People advised by a healthcare professional to avoid specific acetates or glycerol derivatives should check labels and seek guidance.
- Anyone with concerns about food additives in general can choose products that minimize or avoid additives; many have alternatives like [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) or [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol).

If you have a medical condition, always follow your clinician’s advice on diet and ingredients.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Glyceryl diacetate is the same as diacetyl.” Fact: They are different substances; diacetyl is a flavor compound (butanedione), while glyceryl diacetate is an ester of glycerol and acetic acid.
- Myth: “E1517 and E1518 are interchangeable.” Fact: They are related but distinct; E1517 is the diacetate (diacetin) and [E1518](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate) is the triacetate (triacetin), with slightly different solubility and performance.
- Fact: In the EU, additives must be listed in the ingredient list by their functional class plus name or E-number, so you may see “humectant: glyceryl diacetate” or “humectant: E1517.”[^5]

## Glyceryl diacetate in branded foods
Usage varies by recipe and country. To check a specific product, read the ingredient list for “glyceryl diacetate” or “E1517,” or contact the manufacturer’s customer service.
