Polyvinyl alcohol–polyethylene glycol graft co‑polymer (E1209) is a man‑made film‑forming substance. Food makers use it mostly to coat tablets and capsules in food supplements so they are smooth, protected from moisture, and easier to swallow. In the European Union (EU), it is an approved additive with detailed quality specifications.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic polymer made by attaching polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains to a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) backbone
- Main job: glazing/film‑forming agent for tablet and capsule coatings
- Where you’ll see it: coated food supplements; it is uncommon in everyday foods
- How it appears on labels: “E1209” or “polyvinyl alcohol–polyethylene glycol graft co‑polymer”
- Dietary notes: synthetic, not animal‑derived (generally suitable for vegetarians and vegans)

## Why is Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer added to food?
Coatings made with E1209 form smooth, thin films that help tablets and capsules glide down more easily, protect them from humidity, and reduce dusting and sticking during manufacture. The coating can also mask taste and odor and give a uniform, glossy look.

## What foods contain Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer?
In the EU, E1209 is an authorized food additive; it appears mainly in the coatings of solid food supplements such as tablets and capsules, rather than in ordinary foods.[^2] Consumers can check permitted uses and categories in the EU’s public food additives database.[^4]

On ingredient lists, look for “E1209,” “polyvinyl alcohol–polyethylene glycol graft co‑polymer,” “PVA–PEG graft copolymer,” or similar wording.

## What can replace Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer?
Several other glazing or film‑forming additives can serve similar roles, depending on the product and process:
- Natural resins and waxes: [shellac](/e904-shellac), [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax)
- Polysaccharide films: [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan), [hydroxypropyl methylcellulose](/e464-hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose), [ethyl cellulose](/e462-ethyl-cellulose)
- Other synthetics: [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol), [polyethylene glycol](/e1521-polyethylene-glycol)

The best alternative depends on needed properties such as gloss, moisture barrier, solubility, and labeling goals.

## How is Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer made?
E1209 is produced by chemically grafting polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains onto a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) backbone. EU additive specifications set out its identity and purity criteria, including the allowed composition range and limits for residual materials, to ensure consistent quality for food use.[^1]

## Is Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer safe to eat?
In the EU, food additives may be used only if they are authorized by law after a safety assessment and are limited to the intended uses and levels.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluates the safety of additives as part of this process.[^3] E1209 has legally binding identity and purity specifications for food use, which help ensure it meets safety and quality expectations when manufactured and used as intended.[^1]

## Does Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer have any benefits?
For consumers, coatings made with E1209 can:
- Make tablets and capsules easier to swallow
- Help keep moisture-sensitive supplements stable
- Reduce off‑tastes or odors by forming a thin barrier

For manufacturers, it offers reliable film formation, good gloss, and smoother processing with less sticking.

## Who should avoid Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic additives in supplements
- Individuals with a known sensitivity to PEG‑based excipients or to PVA should check labels and consult a healthcare professional
- Anyone advised by a clinician to avoid specific excipients in coated tablets or capsules

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E1209 is just plastic wrap on pills.”  
  Fact: It is a thin, purpose‑made film coating designed for tablets and capsules, not the same as packaging plastics.
- Myth: “It builds up in the body.”  
  Fact: Additives are authorized only after safety review; they must be suitable for their intended use and typical exposure.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s used in all foods.”  
  Fact: Its use is mainly in coated food supplements, not in everyday foods.[^4]

## Polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol-graft-co-polymer in branded foods
You are most likely to see E1209 on labels of coated tablets and capsules sold as food supplements in the EU. It is uncommon on the ingredient lists of regular foods. If you want to confirm whether a product uses it, check the ingredient list for “E1209” or its full name.
