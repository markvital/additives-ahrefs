Gum Guaicum (E241) is a natural tree resin also known as guaiac resin. It was historically used in foods as an antioxidant to slow rancidity in fats and oils, but it is uncommon on modern ingredient lists in many regions.

## At a glance
- What it is: a brittle, aromatic resin from Guaiacum trees (lignum vitae).
- What it does: works as an antioxidant to help protect fats and oils from turning rancid.
- Where it shows up: now rare in everyday foods; labeling practices vary by country.
- Regulatory note: it is not on today’s European Union (EU) Union list of permitted additives.
- Diet and allergens: no nutrients added; used in very small amounts when used.

## Why is Gum Guaicum added to food?
Gum Guaicum is added for its antioxidant effect. Antioxidants help keep foods, especially fats and oils, from reacting with oxygen. That slows down off-flavors and odors and can help maintain color and shelf life. In practice, manufacturers often choose other antioxidants that are more common and easier to source today.

## What foods contain Gum Guaicum?
You are unlikely to find E241 on labels in the European Union because Gum Guaicum is not included in the current EU Union list of authorized food additives.[^1] In markets where it is allowed, it may appear in fatty foods and oil-rich products, listed as “E241” or “Gum Guaicum.” Rules and usage can differ by country, so local labels are the best guide.

## What can replace Gum Guaicum?
Food makers typically use other antioxidants that are widely accepted and available, such as:
- [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) (vitamin E)
- [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) and [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Synthetic antioxidants like [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha) and [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene)

The “best” substitute depends on the food’s fat content, flavor profile, and the rules in the country where it’s sold.

## How is Gum Guaicum made?
Gum Guaicum is a natural resin obtained from the heartwood of Guaiacum trees (Guaiacum officinale and Guaiacum sanctum). The resin can be collected directly or produced by extracting the wood with alcohol, then filtering and solidifying the resin. Its composition is a mix of natural resin acids and related compounds typical of tree resins.[^3]

## Is Gum Guaicum safe to eat?
Safety rules depend on where you live. In the European Union, only additives on the “Union list” may be used in foods; Gum Guaicum (E241) is not on that list, so it is not authorized for food use in the EU.[^2][^1] Outside the EU, policies vary. Gum Guaicum is also known for a non-food use: it is the reactive ingredient on guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) cards used in colorectal cancer screening.[^4] That medical use does not imply approval as a food additive.

## Does Gum Guaicum have any benefits?
As a food additive, any benefit is technological rather than nutritional. Its value is in helping protect fats and oils from oxidation, which can support flavor and shelf life. It does not add vitamins, minerals, or calories.

## Who should avoid Gum Guaicum?
- People who prefer to avoid little-used or legacy additives may choose products that rely on more familiar antioxidants.
- Individuals with known sensitivity to resins or fragrance chemicals might wish to avoid it as a precaution, although reported food uses are rare today.
- If you follow rules specific to your region (for example, the EU), check local guidance and labels.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are always synthetic.” Fact: E-numbers are just codes used in Europe; many refer to natural substances, and Gum Guaicum is a tree resin.[^2]
- Myth: “Gum Guaicum is a common modern additive.” Fact: It is not included in the current EU Union list of permitted additives, so you are unlikely to see it on EU labels.[^1]
- Myth: “If a substance is used in medical tests, it must be a nutrient.” Fact: Gum Guaicum’s well-known role is as a chemical reagent in stool blood tests, not as a nutrient in food.[^4]

## Gum Guaicum in branded foods
We did not find evidence of routine use in mainstream EU or U.S. products. If it appears where you shop, it will likely be listed by name or as “E241.” Because regulations vary, checking the ingredient list on the actual product is the most reliable method.
