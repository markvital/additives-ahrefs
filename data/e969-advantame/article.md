- Also called/E-number: Advantame; E969
- What it does: High-intensity sweetener and flavor enhancer
- Common in: Diet soft drinks, flavored waters, chewing gum, tabletop blends, yogurt, baked goods
- Diet flags: Zero-calorie; gluten-free; suitable for vegan and vegetarian diets; keto-friendly

1) Why it’s added to food
- Advantame provides strong sweetness with no calories. It is very sweet, so only tiny amounts are needed. It is heat-stable and works in baking and drinks.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You may see advantame in diet sodas, energy and sports drinks, flavored waters, powdered drink mixes, and syrups. It also appears in sugar-free chewing gum, candies, dairy desserts, puddings, and some baked goods. Check labels for “advantame.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Other high-intensity sweeteners include sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), stevia/steviol glycosides, monk fruit (luo han guo), saccharin, and neotame. If you prefer “from plant” options, look for stevia or monk fruit on labels. If you want to avoid any high-intensity sweeteners, choose products sweetened with sugar, honey, or erythritol/other polyols.

4) How Advantame is manufactured
- Advantame is made by chemically modifying aspartame with a vanillin-related compound to create a new sweet-tasting molecule. The process is done in a controlled setting, followed by purification and quality checks. No animal-derived ingredients are used.

5) How safe is Advantame for consumption?
- Major regulators have reviewed advantame and found it safe at approved levels. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) set by international and EU experts is 5 mg per kg of body weight per day.

  - EFSA (European Food Safety Authority): URL to be added by editor (Takeaway: Scientific opinion supports safety; ADI of 5 mg/kg bw/day.)

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Advantame can help reduce added sugar and calories when used instead of sugar. It does not contribute to tooth decay. It does not raise blood glucose by itself.

7) When Advantame may be unsafe (contraindications)
- People with phenylketonuria (PKU) generally do not need to avoid advantame, because the phenylalanine contribution at approved uses is negligible. If your clinician advised strict phenylalanine limits, ask before use. Some people may notice aftertaste or sensitivity to high-intensity sweeteners; if so, choose alternatives.

Myths & facts
- Myth: Advantame is unsafe for people with PKU because it’s related to aspartame. Fact: FDA does not require a PKU warning for advantame; exposure to phenylalanine from approved uses is negligible. Source: FDA — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: Advantame causes cancer. Fact: EFSA’s safety review found no evidence of carcinogenicity at permitted intakes. Source: EFSA — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: Advantame raises blood sugar like regular sugar. Fact: High-intensity sweeteners, including advantame, do not raise blood glucose. Source: FDA — URL to be added by editor

Advantame in Branded Foods
- You’ll find advantame in some diet soft drinks, powdered drink mixes, tabletop sweetener blends, and sugar-free gum and candies. It may appear alongside sucralose, Ace-K, or stevia.
