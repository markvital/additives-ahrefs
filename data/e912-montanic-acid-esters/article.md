Montanic acid esters (E912) are food-grade waxy compounds used to polish and protect the surface of certain foods. They give candies and other items a smooth, glossy finish and help keep pieces from sticking together. In the European Union (EU), they are authorized as a glazing agent under specific rules.

## At a glance
- Role in food: A glazing agent that adds shine and reduces sticking on surfaces.
- What it is: Esters of long‑chain “montanic” acids obtained from refined montan wax (a wax derived from lignite, a type of brown coal).
- Typical where found: Surface treatment of selected foods, such as some confectionery and similar coated items in the EU.
- Status: Authorized in the EU with detailed purity specifications and permitted uses listed in law.

## Why is Montanic acid esters added to food?
Food makers use E912 as a glazing agent—an additive applied to the surface to create a uniform shine and protective coating. This thin layer helps:
- Improve appearance and gloss
- Reduce stickiness and clumping in packaged products
- Provide a light moisture barrier that can help preserve texture[^2]

In EU law, glazing agents are a recognized functional class of additives used on food surfaces rather than mixed throughout the product.[^2]

## What foods contain Montanic acid esters?
You are most likely to encounter E912 on the surface of coated or polished items—think sugar-coated sweets, dragees, or similar products where a smooth, glossy finish matters. In the European Union, permitted uses and any conditions (like which food categories and maximum levels) are set out in Annex II of the food additive regulation. Always check the ingredient list; manufacturers must declare authorized additives by name or E‑number (e.g., “E912”).[^2]

## What can replace Montanic acid esters?
Other glazing agents can serve similar roles, depending on the food and local rules:
- [Carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) (plant-derived)
- [Shellac](/e904-shellac) (resinous coating)
- [Microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax)
- [Oxidised polyethylene wax](/e914-oxidised-polyethylene-wax)

Which one fits best depends on the specific product, desired gloss, melting point, labeling preferences, and the regulations that apply.

## How is Montanic acid esters made?
E912 is produced from montan wax, a natural wax obtained by extracting and refining waxy substances from lignite (brown coal). The long‑chain fatty acids in this wax—often called montanic acids—are then chemically reacted with small diols (such as ethylene glycol or 1,3‑butanediol) to form esters. EU specifications define identity, permitted source materials, and purity limits (for example, on residual solvents and trace metals) to ensure consistency and safety for food use.[^1]

## Is Montanic acid esters safe to eat?
Within the EU, food additives can be used only if they are authorized and meet strict specifications. Montanic acid esters (E912) are listed in EU legislation with detailed identity and purity criteria, and their uses are restricted to particular foods and conditions set out in the Union list.[^1][^2] Before authorization, additives undergo risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and their legal status is kept under review as new data emerge.[^3]

## Does Montanic acid esters have any benefits?
Yes—its benefits are technical rather than nutritional:
- Adds a durable, high‑gloss finish to improve appearance
- Helps pieces flow and pour by reducing stickiness
- Provides a light surface barrier that can help maintain texture during storage[^2]

## Who should avoid Montanic acid esters?
Most people do not need to avoid E912 specifically. However, you may choose to avoid it if:
- You prefer to skip mineral‑derived waxes on principle
- You are following dietary guidance to minimize additives in general
As always, check labels if you are managing your intake of particular additives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E912 is a kind of plastic.” Fact: Montanic acid esters are waxy esters of long‑chain fatty acids; they are not plastic polymers.[^1]
- Myth: “All food glazes are the same.” Fact: Several different glazing agents are approved, each with its own source, properties, and labeling—E912 is just one option.[^2]
- Myth: “Glazing agents get mixed into the food.” Fact: They are surface treatments; their purpose is to coat the outside, not to alter the food’s core recipe.[^2]

## Montanic acid esters in branded foods
On labels in the EU, look for “Montanic acid esters” or “E912,” typically in small amounts near the end of the ingredient list. You’ll most often see it on polished or coated items such as dragee‑style candies or similar confectionery. Availability and use can vary by country and product category, so not all brands will use E912.
