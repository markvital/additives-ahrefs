Propylene glycol (E490) is a clear, slightly syrupy liquid used in foods mainly as a solvent and moisture keeper. It helps dissolve flavors and colors and prevents baked goods and confections from drying out. It has been evaluated by major regulators and is considered safe at permitted levels.

## At a glance
- What it is: A small, water‑soluble molecule also called 1,2‑propanediol
- What it does: Works as a humectant (keeps foods moist), solvent, and carrier for flavors and colors
- Where it’s found: Flavor extracts, beverages, icings and frostings, soft candies, and some baked goods
- Taste/texture: Nearly tasteless; helps keep textures soft and uniform
- Label names: Propylene glycol, propane‑1,2‑diol, 1,2‑propanediol, E490

## Why is Propylene glycol added to food?
Manufacturers use propylene glycol because it holds water (humectant) and dissolves flavorings, colors, and certain functional ingredients evenly throughout a recipe. It also acts as a processing aid to keep mixtures uniform and pourable during production. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms propylene glycol as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for use in food at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice (GMP).^1

## What foods contain Propylene glycol?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Flavor extracts and concentrates, where it carries vanilla, citrus, mint, or spice flavors
- Ready‑to‑drink beverages and flavored syrups
- Icings, glazes, and frostings to keep them smooth and spreadable
- Soft candies, caramels, and certain bars to prevent drying
- Some baked goods and cake mixes to help retain moisture

It may also appear as a carrier in color blends and in powdered mixes to improve flow during processing.

## What can replace Propylene glycol?
Depending on the job, common alternatives include:
- For moisture retention: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), or [xylitol](/e967-xylitol) in sugar‑free items
- For dissolving flavors: [ethanol](/e1510-ethanol) or [glyceryl triacetate (triacetin)](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate)
- For texture/stabilizing in acidic systems: [propylene glycol alginate](/e405-propane-1-2-diol-alginate)
- For emulsification instead of carrier use: [propane‑1,2‑diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids)

The best substitute depends on taste, labeling needs, and whether the food is heat‑processed or acidic.

## How is Propylene glycol made?
Most commercial propylene glycol is produced by adding water to propylene oxide, yielding mainly 1,2‑propanediol. It can also be made by hydrogenating glycerol, a by‑product of biodiesel manufacturing.^4

## Is Propylene glycol safe to eat?
In the U.S., propylene glycol is GRAS when used at levels consistent with GMP, meaning manufacturers must use the minimum amount needed to achieve the intended effect.^1 In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for propylene glycol (also called propane‑1,2‑diol), and estimated that typical dietary exposures are below this limit for the general population.^2

## Does Propylene glycol have any benefits?
For consumers, propylene glycol helps:
- Keep baked goods, bars, and confections soft and less prone to drying
- Disperse flavors and colors evenly for consistent taste and appearance
- Maintain smooth textures in icings and glazes
- Support shelf life indirectly by helping control moisture

## Who should avoid Propylene glycol?
- Cats: Propylene glycol is not allowed in cat food due to the risk of Heinz body formation in red blood cells; its use in or on cat food is prohibited in the U.S.^3
- Individuals with a diagnosed sensitivity: Although uncommon, anyone advised by a healthcare professional to avoid propylene glycol should check labels.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as toxic antifreeze.” Fact: The highly toxic automotive antifreeze is usually ethylene glycol, a different chemical. Propylene glycol has a very different safety profile and is permitted in foods within strict limits.^1 ^2
- “It’s only in ultra‑processed foods.” Fact: It’s most common in processed items, but it can also appear in everyday products like flavor extracts and icings because it dissolves flavorings well.
- “There’s no limit to how much can be used.” Fact: In the U.S., use must follow GMP, which means only the minimum amount needed is allowed; in the EU, an ADI applies.^1 ^2

## Propylene glycol in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “propylene glycol,” “propane‑1,2‑diol,” “1,2‑propanediol,” or “E490.” You’ll often find it on flavored syrups, vanilla and mint extracts, ready‑to‑drink beverages, cake mixes, frostings, soft candies, and snack bars. It can also appear in color blends and seasoning carriers where it helps distribute flavors consistently.
