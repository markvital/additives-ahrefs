      "q": "what is yellow prussiate of soda made from",
      "a": "It’s sodium ferrocyanide, the sodium salt of the [Fe(CN)6]4− complex, made industrially by combining iron salts with cyanide and sodium under controlled conditions to form a stable coordination compound.",

      "q": "anticaking effect of yellow prussiate of soda (na4[fe(cn)6]10h2o)\".\\ how much is toxic",
      "a": "It prevents salt crystals from sticking together by inhibiting crystal bridging and moisture‑induced clumping; the acceptable daily intake is 0–0.025 mg/kg body weight (≈1.75 mg/day for a 70‑kg adult), and permitted salt levels (typically about 10–20 mg/kg) keep exposures well below this.",

      "q": "e535 boots when opened",
      "a": "If you mean opening a container of salt that contains E535, nothing special happens—it's stable and present at trace levels; just store salt dry and away from strong acids.",

      "a": "It’s sodium ferrocyanide (E535), a stable, approved anti‑caking agent used in minute amounts in table salt to keep it free‑flowing; safety assessments set an ADI of 0–0.025 mg/kg body weight, and regulatory limits in salt are typically around 10–20 mg/kg.",
