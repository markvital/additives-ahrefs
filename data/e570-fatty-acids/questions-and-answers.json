    {
      "q": "how many fatty acids are in a phospholipid?",
      "a": "Two; most phospholipids have two fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone along with a phosphate-containing head group.",

    {
      "q": "what are omega 3 fatty acids",
      "a": "Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats whose first double bond is at the third carbon from the methyl end, such as ALA, EPA, and DHA.",

    {
      "q": "what is a fatty acid",
      "a": "A fatty acid (E570) is a carboxylic acid with a long hydrocarbon chain; in foods, E570 refers to purified fatty acids from edible fats used mainly as processing aids like release/lubricating agents.",

    {
      "q": "where does fatty acid synthesis occur",
      "a": "In humans, de novo fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol—especially in liver and adipose tissue—via the fatty acid synthase complex; in plants it occurs in chloroplasts.",

    {
      "q": "what is a saturated fatty acid",
      "a": "A saturated fatty acid has no carbon–carbon double bonds, giving a straight chain often solid at room temperature; common E570 examples include palmitic (C16) and stearic (C18) acids.",
