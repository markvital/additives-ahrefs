Fatty acids (E570) are a group of long-chain acids made from edible fats and oils. In food, they are used in very small amounts to help products release from molds, keep powders free‑flowing, and carry flavors or fat‑soluble ingredients. They can come from plant or animal sources.

## At a glance
- What it is: A mixture of food-grade fatty acids obtained from edible fats and oils.
- What it does: Works mainly as a release agent, anti-caking aid, carrier, and processing aid.
- Where it’s used: Many everyday foods, from baked goods and confectionery to powdered mixes and supplements.
- Sourcing note: Can be plant- or animal-derived; labels seldom state the source.
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU as E570 and widely permitted in the U.S. when used as intended.

## Why are fatty acids added to food?
Fatty acids help food processing run smoothly. They act as release agents so candies, baked goods, and snacks come out of molds and pans cleanly. They can keep powders from clumping, help flavors spread in a mix, and support stable textures in some recipes. In tiny amounts, they also help other emulsifiers and stabilizers do their job, such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins).

## What foods contain fatty acids?
You may find E570 in:
- Bakery items and confectionery where a release or glazing aid is needed
- Chewing gum and snack coatings
- Powdered foods or supplements that need to stay free‑flowing
- Flavor systems, where certain fatty acids are used as flavoring substances

In the U.S., specific fatty acids such as octanoic (caprylic) and decanoic (capric) acids are permitted as flavoring agents under 21 CFR 172.515 when used as described in the regulation.[^1]

## What can replace fatty acids?
Depending on the job, manufacturers might instead use:
- Release and coating agents: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), or [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- Emulsifiers and texture aids: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate), or [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Carriers for flavors and vitamins: modified starches like [starch sodium octenyl succinate](/e1450-starch-sodium-octenyl-succinate)
- Salts of fatty acids that behave similarly: [sodium, potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids](/e470a-sodium-potassium-and-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids), [magnesium salts of fatty acids](/e470b-magnesium-salts-of-fatty-acids)

## How is fatty acids made?
E570 is defined in the EU as a mixture of fatty acids obtained by hydrolyzing (splitting) edible fats and oils, followed by fractionation and purification. The fats and oils used may be of animal or vegetable origin.[^2]

## Is fatty acids safe to eat?
In the European Union, E570 appears on the Union list of authorized food additives and must meet detailed identity and purity specifications before use.[^3] In the United States, many long‑chain fatty acids and their salts are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice (GMP), as reflected in FDA’s Food Additive Status List.[^4] These uses add only tiny amounts compared with the fats naturally present in a normal diet.

GRAS means “Generally Recognized As Safe,” a U.S. term for substances that qualified experts consider safe under the conditions of their intended use. GMP means using no more than needed to achieve the effect.

## Does fatty acids have any benefits?
For consumers, the benefit is stable, consistent food: powders that don’t cake, candies that release cleanly, and coatings that look uniform. For manufacturers, fatty acids can reduce waste and improve efficiency because products are less likely to stick or clump.

## Who should avoid fatty acids?
- Vegans, vegetarians, and people with religious dietary rules may want to verify the source, since E570 can be made from either animal or plant fats.[^2]
- People on medically prescribed very low‑fat diets should know that additive levels are very small and contribute negligible fat, but they can still check with a healthcare professional if unsure.
- Allergies to fatty acids themselves are uncommon; if you have concerns, check with your doctor.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E570 is the same as trans fat.” Fact: E570 typically refers to straight‑chain fatty acids used as additives; “trans fat” refers to certain unsaturated fats with a trans double bond.
- Myth: “It always comes from animals.” Fact: It can be sourced from either animal or vegetable fats—manufacturers may be able to confirm the origin.[^2]
- Myth: “It adds a lot of fat.” Fact: It is used in very small amounts for technical effects, not for nutrition.

## Fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “fatty acids” or “E570.” Some labels specify the exact acid (for example, “stearic acid”) or show a related emulsifier made from fatty acids. If the source matters to you (plant vs. animal), contact the brand’s customer service. Many companies can tell you the origin for specific batches.
