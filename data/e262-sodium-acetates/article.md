Sodium acetates (E262) are salts of acetic acid used to regulate acidity, add a tangy “salt-and-vinegar” taste, and help keep foods fresh. The group includes sodium acetate and sodium diacetate, both widely used in snacks, baked goods, and some meat and poultry products. <!--more-->

## At a glance
- E-number: E262; group name: sodium acetates (sodium acetate and sodium diacetate)
- What it does: acidity regulator, preservative, and flavoring aid
- Where it’s found: chips and snack seasonings, breads and tortillas, sauces and pickles, and some meat and poultry items
- Taste profile: sharp, vinegar-like tang (especially sodium diacetate)
- Diets: typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets; contains sodium

## Why is Sodium acetates added to food?
Manufacturers use E262 to adjust and stabilize acidity (pH), which supports flavor and helps other preservatives work better. Sodium acetates also slow the growth of spoilage organisms, especially molds in bakery items, making them useful as preservatives at permitted levels.[^1] Sodium diacetate, a defined combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid, is particularly valued for delivering a controlled “vinegar” note while regulating acidity.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium acetates?
You’ll most often see E262 in:
- Seasoned snacks (for a salt-and-vinegar style flavor)
- Breads, tortillas, and other bakery goods
- Pickled vegetables and sauces
- Some processed meat and poultry products, where it can be used as a safe and suitable ingredient under U.S. rules[^3]

Food laws define E262 as approved additives with set purity and use conditions, which is why these categories commonly include them.[^1]

## What can replace Sodium acetates?
Depending on the job, common stand-ins include:
- For acidity regulation: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate)
- For preservation: [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [sodium propionate](/e281-sodium-propionate) in bakery
- For flavor: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) or a spice/vinegar powder
- For sodium contribution with acidity control: [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate)

The best substitute depends on whether you need pH control, shelf-life extension, flavor, or all three.

## How is Sodium acetates made?
Sodium acetate is typically produced by neutralizing food-grade [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) with a sodium base such as [sodium carbonate](/e500i-sodium-carbonate), [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate), or [sodium hydroxide](/e524-sodium-hydroxide), then drying to specification.[^1] Sodium diacetate is a defined combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid in approximately a 1:1 molar ratio, offering a stable, solid form that releases acetic acid flavor and acidity in foods.[^1]

## Is Sodium acetates safe to eat?
Within approved uses and good manufacturing practice, regulatory bodies consider E262 safe. In the European Union, sodium acetates have official specifications and are authorized as food additives.[^1] In the United States, sodium diacetate is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for specified functions and levels,[^2] and it is also listed as a safe and suitable ingredient for certain meat and poultry applications by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).[^3]

## Does Sodium acetates have any benefits?
Technologically, E262 helps:
- Stabilize pH to maintain flavor and texture
- Extend shelf life by inhibiting spoilage organisms in certain foods
- Deliver a clean, vinegar-like flavor (notably sodium diacetate), and function as a flavoring adjuvant under U.S. rules[^2]

It does not provide unique nutritional benefits beyond contributing small amounts of sodium.

## Who should avoid Sodium acetates?
- People on sodium-restricted diets should keep an eye on total sodium intake, including from additives like E262.
- Individuals who dislike or are sensitive to sharp, vinegar-like flavors may prefer products without sodium diacetate.
- As always, consult a healthcare professional if you have kidney disease, hypertension, or other conditions requiring strict sodium management.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E262 is just table salt.” Fact: It’s a sodium salt of acetic acid, not sodium chloride.
- Myth: “Sodium diacetate is artificial vinegar.” Fact: It is a defined combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid that provides a vinegar-like taste and pH control.[^1]
- Myth: “All preservatives are harsh chemicals.” Fact: E262 is derived from acetic acid (the main acid in vinegar) and is approved with strict purity and use limits.[^1]

## Sodium acetates in branded foods
On labels, look for “sodium acetate,” “sodium diacetate,” or “E262.” You may also see them listed as an “acidity regulator,” “preservative,” or “flavoring.” Snack foods and bakery items often use E262 for flavor and freshness, while some meat and poultry products may use sodium diacetate under specific rules. If you want to avoid it, check ingredient lists and choose versions seasoned or preserved with alternatives like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate).
