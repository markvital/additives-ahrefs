Sorbitan trioleate (E496) is an emulsifier that helps oil and water mix smoothly. It is made by reacting sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) with oleic acid from vegetable oils. Food makers use it in small amounts to keep flavors and beverages stable during shelf life.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier made from sorbitol and oleic acid.
- What it does: keeps oil and water from separating; stabilizes flavor emulsions.
- Where it’s found: flavorings and beverage emulsions; appears on labels as “sorbitan trioleate” or “E496.”
- Status in the EU: has official identity and purity specifications and is on the Union list of approved food additives.

## Why is Sorbitan trioleate added to food?
Manufacturers add sorbitan trioleate to keep oil-based flavor components evenly dispersed in water-based foods and drinks. Without an emulsifier, citrus oils and other flavor oils can separate, causing ring formation, cloud loss, or uneven taste. E496 helps prevent this separation so the product tastes and looks the same from the first sip to the last.

## What foods contain Sorbitan trioleate?
You are most likely to find E496 in:
- Flavor emulsions that are later added to soft drinks and other beverages
- Liquid flavor concentrates used in food manufacturing

In the EU, sorbitan trioleate has official specifications and is authorized as a food additive; always check the ingredient list to confirm its presence in specific products.[^1][^2]

## What can replace Sorbitan trioleate?
The best substitute depends on the recipe, pH, and fat content. Common alternatives include:
- Other sorbitan esters such as [sorbitan monooleate](/e494-sorbitan-monooleate) or [sorbitan tristearate](/e492-sorbitan-tristearate)
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (often from soy or sunflower)
- Polysorbates such as [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate)
- Application-specific emulsifiers like [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for some oil-in-water systems

Formulators often test blends to match the stability and mouthfeel of the original product.

## How is Sorbitan trioleate made?
Sorbitan trioleate is produced by:
1) Dehydrating sorbitol to form sorbitan,
2) Esterifying sorbitan with oleic acid (a fatty acid typically sourced from vegetable oils),
3) Purifying the product to meet identity and purity specifications (limits for contaminants, acid value, saponification value, and other quality criteria).[^1]

## Is Sorbitan trioleate safe to eat?
In the European Union, a food additive can be used only after a safety evaluation and inclusion on the Union list. Sorbitan trioleate (E496) appears on that list and has detailed specifications, which indicates it has been assessed for the uses allowed under EU law.[^2][^1] International expert committees have also evaluated sorbitan esters as a group and established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) range for this class of additives.[^3]

As with many emulsifiers, very high intakes may lead to digestive discomfort in some people, but typical amounts used in foods are small. If you have specific dietary concerns, talk with your healthcare professional.

## Does Sorbitan trioleate have any benefits?
E496 does not add nutrients, flavor, or color. Its benefits are technological:
- Keeps flavor oils dispersed in beverages, preventing rings and separation
- Helps maintain consistent taste, aroma, and appearance during shelf life
- Can reduce waste by improving process stability

## Who should avoid Sorbitan trioleate?
Most people do not need to avoid E496. You may choose to limit it if:
- You are following a diet that restricts emulsifiers for personal or medical reasons
- You notice digestive sensitivity to emulsifiers and are troubleshooting your diet with a clinician

If you are unsure, check labels and discuss with your healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sorbitan trioleate is the same as polysorbate 80.”  
  Fact: They are related emulsifiers but not the same; polysorbates are polyoxyethylene derivatives, while sorbitan trioleate is a non-ethoxylated sorbitan ester.  
- Myth: “It’s only made from animal fats.”  
  Fact: Food-grade sorbitan trioleate is typically made using oleic acid from vegetable oils; always ask suppliers if you need a specific source.  
- Myth: “If oil separates in a drink, it means there’s no emulsifier.”  
  Fact: Separation can have many causes (heat, storage time, or formulation changes). Emulsifiers help, but processing and packaging also matter.

## Sorbitan trioleate in branded foods
On labels, look for “sorbitan trioleate” or “E496.” It most often appears in flavor emulsions used to make soft drinks and other beverages. Because flavor emulsions are ingredients themselves, E496 may not be present in every product of a given brand—always check the ingredient list.
