      "q": "does calcium citrate cause constipation",
      "a": "At the small amounts used in foods (E333), it’s unlikely to cause constipation; at supplement doses, some people may experience it, but calcium citrate is generally less constipating than calcium carbonate.",

    {
      "q": "which is better for osteoporosis calcium citrate or carbonate",
      "a": "Both can help if total calcium and vitamin D intake are adequate; calcium citrate is better absorbed (especially with low stomach acid) and gentler on the gut, while carbonate has more elemental calcium per tablet, costs less, but is more likely to cause constipation and should be taken with food.",

    {
      "q": "is calcium citrate the same as calcium",
      "a": "No—calcium citrate is the calcium salt of citric acid (E333) that supplies calcium; “calcium” refers to the elemental mineral itself.",

    {
      "q": "what is the difference between calcium and calcium citrate",
      "a": "Calcium is the elemental nutrient, whereas calcium citrate is a compound that delivers calcium bound to citrate (about 21–24% calcium by weight) and is used as a food additive (E333) and in supplements; the citrate form is more soluble and well absorbed.",

    {
      "q": "can calcium citrate cause constipation",
      "a": "At food-use levels it’s unlikely; at supplement doses it can in some people, though it tends to cause less constipation than calcium carbonate.",
