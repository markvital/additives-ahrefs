Soybean hemicellulose (E 426) is a plant-based carbohydrate taken from soybeans. Food makers use it in small amounts to help keep texture smooth and mixtures stable in products like drinks, sauces, and noodles. It is an approved food additive in the European Union with defined purity rules.

## At a glance
- E-number: E 426; name: Soybean hemicellulose
- What it does: helps stabilize, thicken, and keep water and oil mixed
- Source: extracted from soybeans (a plant source)
- Typical uses: beverages, sauces, bakery, noodles, and frozen foods
- Allergen note: made from soy; people with soy allergy should avoid it
- Status in the EU: authorized food additive with official specifications[^1][^2]

## Why is Soybean hemicellulose added to food?
Manufacturers add soybean hemicellulose to control texture and stability. It can help keep particles suspended in drinks, reduce separation in sauces and dressings, and improve softness or chew in baked goods and noodles. In short, it helps foods stay uniform from first bite (or sip) to last.

## What foods contain Soybean hemicellulose?
You may find it in:
- Acidic and dairy-style beverages
- Sauces and dressings
- Baked goods and fillings
- Noodles and pasta
- Frozen desserts and ready meals

On labels, it may appear as “soybean hemicellulose,” “soybean polysaccharide,” or “E 426.”

## What can replace Soybean hemicellulose?
Other hydrocolloids (water-binding gums and fibers) can often do a similar job, depending on the recipe:
- [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum)
- [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum)
- [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)

Choice depends on the food’s pH (acidity), desired thickness, and whether freezing or heating is involved.

## How is Soybean hemicellulose made?
Soybean hemicellulose is obtained from soybeans using water-based extraction. The carbohydrate fraction is separated, purified, and dried to a light-colored powder that disperses in water and is used at low levels in foods.[^1]

## Is Soybean hemicellulose safe to eat?
In the European Union, soybean hemicellulose is on the Union list of authorized food additives. That means its use and purity are regulated, and it may be used only under conditions that meet safety and technological-need criteria set in EU law.[^2] The EU also publishes detailed identity and purity specifications for E 426 to ensure product quality and consistency.[^1]

## Does Soybean hemicellulose have any benefits?
For food makers, it offers steady texture, better suspension in liquids, and resistance to separation during storage. For eaters, these features mean sauces that don’t split, drinks that stay smooth, and noodles or baked goods that keep their bite.

## Who should avoid Soybean hemicellulose?
- People with a soy allergy: Soy is a major allergen in the U.S. and must be labeled. Those with soy allergy should avoid additives derived from soy unless advised otherwise by their clinician.[^3]
- Anyone told by their doctor to follow a soy-free diet.

If you have allergies, always read labels carefully and check with the product maker when in doubt.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a synthetic chemical.” Fact: It is a plant-derived carbohydrate extracted from soybeans.
- “It’s the same as soy protein.” Fact: It is mainly carbohydrate. However, people with soy allergy should still avoid it out of caution.
- “It’s only a thickener.” Fact: It can also stabilize emulsions and help keep solids evenly mixed.

## Soybean hemicellulose in branded foods
You’ll usually find it in the ingredient list as “soybean hemicellulose,” “soybean polysaccharide,” or “E 426.” Products that prize stable texture—like acidic dairy-style drinks, dressings, or frozen treats—are the most likely places to see it. If a product highlights “soy-free,” it should not include this ingredient.
