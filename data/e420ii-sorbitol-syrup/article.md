Sorbitol syrup (E420II) is a sugar alcohol solution used to sweeten, keep foods moist, and add body without using regular sugar. It tastes mildly sweet, has fewer calories than sugar, and helps products stay soft and smooth. You’ll find it in sugar-free sweets, baked goods, and special diet foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: a concentrated solution of sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and related hydrogenated carbohydrates
- What it does: sweetener, humectant (holds moisture), thickener/bulking agent, and stabiliser
- Taste and calories: about 60% as sweet as sugar, with fewer calories per gram than sugar
- Where it’s used: sugar-free candies, chewing gum, baked goods, fillings, sauces, and “no added sugar” products
- Label names: “sorbitol syrup,” “sorbitol solution,” “E420(ii),” or “E420II”
- Safety note: high intakes can cause stomach upset; U.S. rules require a laxative warning at certain levels

## Why is Sorbitol syrup added to food?
Food makers use sorbitol syrup to add gentle sweetness while also improving texture and shelf life. It binds water, which keeps foods from drying out, and it helps give a smooth, soft bite in items like chewing gum, baked goods, and fillings.[^1] Because it is only moderately sweet, it also works well as a bulking agent when replacing part of the sugar.[^1]

## What foods contain Sorbitol syrup?
You’ll often see sorbitol syrup in sugar-free or reduced-sugar products such as candies, chewing gum, cookies, cakes, frostings, jams, and sauces. Some diet or “no added sugar” foods use it to help with texture and moisture. Sorbitol also occurs naturally in fruits like apples and pears, but the additive “sorbitol syrup” is a refined ingredient made for food processing.[^2]

On labels it may appear as “sorbitol syrup,” “sorbitol solution,” “E420(ii)” or “E420II.” In ingredient lists, you may also see plain [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) (E420(i)), which is the crystalline form.

## What can replace Sorbitol syrup?
Different swaps work depending on the job you need done:
- For sweetness with fewer calories: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), or [maltitol](/e965-maltitol)
- For moisture (humectant): [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) or [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol)
- For thickness/texture: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- For high-intensity sweetness only (no bulk): [sucralose](/e955-sucralose)

## How is Sorbitol syrup made?
Sorbitol syrup is produced by hydrogenating glucose (also called dextrose), which is usually obtained by breaking down starch from corn, wheat, or potatoes. The hydrogenation step converts glucose into sorbitol and other hydrogenated saccharides, and the result is concentrated into a syrup.[^1] In the EU, specifications define sorbitol syrup (E 420(ii)) as a mixture where sorbitol is the main component, with set purity and composition limits.[^3]

## Is Sorbitol syrup safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, sorbitol is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In Europe, sorbitol (E 420) is an approved food additive and has been re‑evaluated with no safety concern at typical use levels.[^2]

Like other sugar alcohols, large amounts can cause gas or diarrhea. U.S. labeling rules require the statement “Excess consumption may have a laxative effect” on foods where eating them could lead someone to consume more than 50 grams of sorbitol per day.[^4]

## Does Sorbitol syrup have any benefits?
- Fewer calories than sugar: For U.S. nutrition labeling, sugar alcohols like sorbitol count as 2.4 calories (kilocalories) per gram, compared with about 4 kcal/g for sugar.[^5]
- Tooth-friendly: Replacing sugars with polyols such as sorbitol does not promote tooth decay; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has supported related health claims for polyols when used to replace sugars.[^6]

## Who should avoid Sorbitol syrup?
- People with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should avoid sorbitol, because the body can convert sorbitol to fructose.[^2]
- Anyone who experiences digestive upset from sugar alcohols should limit intake; products may carry a laxative warning when high intakes are likely.[^4]
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to restrict polyols (for example, during certain medical diets), follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sorbitol syrup is just like high-fructose corn syrup.” Fact: Sorbitol syrup is a sugar alcohol mixture, not a fructose–glucose syrup, and it behaves differently in the body.
- Myth: “Sorbitol syrup always tastes as sweet as sugar.” Fact: It is less sweet than sugar, which is why it’s often used for bulk and moisture as well as mild sweetness.
- Myth: “Sugar-free means consequence-free.” Fact: Overdoing sugar alcohols, including sorbitol syrup, can cause stomach upset.

## Sorbitol syrup in branded foods
You can spot sorbitol syrup on ingredient lists under “sorbitol syrup,” “sorbitol solution,” or “E420(ii).” It commonly appears in sugar-free gum and candies, soft cookies and cakes, fillings and frostings, jams, and some reduced-sugar sauces and beverages. If you are sensitive to sugar alcohols, check the label for serving size and any laxative warning.
