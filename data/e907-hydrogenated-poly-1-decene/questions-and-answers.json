      "q": "what is micro crystalline wax",
      "a": "Microcrystalline wax is a petroleum-derived wax with very small crystals (food additive E905c) used for protective and glazing coatings; it’s related to but distinct from E907 (hydrogenated poly‑1‑decene), a synthetic hydrocarbon wax used as a food glazing agent.",

      "q": "state why paraffin wax of small crystalline structure is important",
      "a": "Fine-crystal (microcrystalline) waxes form tougher, smoother, glossier films that resist cracking and moisture, which improves the performance of food coatings and glazes; hydrocarbon wax glazes such as E907 take advantage of these properties for even, durable finishes.",
