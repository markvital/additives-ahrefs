Nitrogen oxide (E932) refers to nitric oxide, a reactive gas with the chemical formula NO. It is sometimes mentioned alongside food packaging gases, but it is not the same as nitrous oxide (E942) or nitrogen (E941), which are widely used in foods.

## At a glance
Here are the basics in one place.
- Name: Nitrogen oxide (nitric oxide), E932
- What it is: A colorless, reactive gas (NO) that readily oxidizes to nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
- Typical role: Hypothetical propellant or packaging gas; not a common food additive
- Where found: Not used in the EU or U.S. as an approved food additive
- Often confused with: [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) (E942) and [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen), which are approved gases

## Why is Nitrogen oxide added to food?
In theory, gases can be added to foods as propellants in aerosols or as “packaging gases” to push out oxygen and slow down spoilage. However, nitric oxide (E932) is not authorized as a food additive in the European Union, so it is not used for these purposes in EU markets.[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms certain gases as GRAS—Generally Recognized as Safe—such as nitrogen and nitrous oxide, but not nitric oxide.[^2][^3]

## What foods contain Nitrogen oxide?
You should not expect to see E932 on ingredient lists in the EU or U.S. because it is not authorized for food use in those jurisdictions.[^1][^2] Where packaging gases are used, manufacturers rely on approved gases such as [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide), [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen), or [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) instead.[^2][^3][^6]

## What can replace Nitrogen oxide?
Companies use established, approved gases that provide the same functional goals (moving product from an aerosol can, or protecting food in the pack):
- [Nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen) for inerting and cushion gas in snacks and coffee[^2]
- [Carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) for antimicrobial effect in chilled foods and beverages[^6]
- [Nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) for whipping cream and foams[^3]
- [Argon](/e938-argon), [oxygen](/e948-oxygen), or [hydrogen](/e949-hydrogen) in specific, regulated applications

## How is Nitrogen oxide made?
Nitric oxide (NO) is a colorless gas. Industrially, it is commonly produced by catalytic oxidation of ammonia (part of the Ostwald process for nitric acid) or by acidifying nitrite salts, both of which generate NO as an intermediate or product.[^4] Because it is reactive, NO readily oxidizes in air to nitrogen dioxide (NO2).[^4]

## Is Nitrogen oxide safe to eat?
Food safety agencies have not authorized nitric oxide as a food additive in the EU, and it does not appear on the U.S. FDA list of GRAS food gases, so there is no established acceptable daily intake for food use in these regions.[^1][^2][^3] As a workplace chemical, nitric oxide is a potent respiratory irritant; inhaling it can reduce oxygen delivery and it can oxidize to NO2, which is also hazardous.[^5] These are occupational hazards and not typical consumer risks, since NO is not used in foods in the EU or U.S.

## Does Nitrogen oxide have any benefits?
There is no established, approved benefit for nitric oxide as a food additive in the EU or U.S. Approved gases such as [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen), [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide), and [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) already provide the needed functions (inerting, shelf-life extension, whipping) within current regulations.[^2][^3][^6]

## Who should avoid Nitrogen oxide?
Consumers generally do not encounter nitric oxide in foods in the EU or U.S. Workers who might handle compressed nitric oxide in non-food settings should avoid inhalation and follow safety guidance, especially those with asthma or respiratory conditions.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Nitrogen oxide” is the same as laughing gas. Fact: Laughing gas is nitrous oxide (N2O, E942), not nitric oxide (NO).  
- Myth: E932 is just another name for [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen). Fact: Nitrogen is E941; nitric oxide is chemically different (reactive and not approved for food use in EU/U.S.).  
- Myth: E932 is the same as curing nitrite. Fact: Nitrites ([potassium nitrite](/e249-potassium-nitrite), [sodium nitrite](/e250-sodium-nitrite)) are separate additives with different regulations and uses.

## Nitrogen oxide in branded foods
If a product used this gas where it is permitted, the label would likely show “E932” or “nitrogen oxide.” In the EU and U.S., you are more likely to see approved gases such as E941 (nitrogen), E942 (nitrous oxide), or E290 (carbon dioxide) on labels for snacks, coffee, or whipped toppings.
