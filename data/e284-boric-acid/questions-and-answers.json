      "q": "does boric acid help bv",
      "a": "It may help with recurrent bacterial vaginosis as an adjunct to standard antibiotics by restoring acidic pH and disrupting biofilms, but it isn’t first-line therapy and should be used under clinician guidance.",

      "q": "does boric acid make you tighter",
      "a": "No—boric acid does not tighten the vagina; it may reduce odor and discharge by addressing infection and pH, but it doesn’t change tissue elasticity.",
