Lecithins (E322) are mixtures of natural fats called phospholipids, most often taken from soy, sunflower, or egg yolk. In food, they act mainly as emulsifiers, helping oil and water mix, and as mild antioxidants that help keep flavors stable.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of lecithins.
- What it is: A blend of phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, found in plant oils and egg yolk.
- What it does: Emulsifier and mild antioxidant that improves texture and shelf stability.
- Where it’s used: Chocolate, baked goods, margarines and spreads, instant drink powders, dressings, and more.
- Safety status: Approved in the U.S. and EU for use in foods; considered safe at typical use levels.
- Common sources: Soy and sunflower are most common; egg lecithin is also used.

## Why is Lecithins added to food?
Food makers use lecithins because they let oil and water mix smoothly, which keeps sauces from separating, chocolate flowing, and doughs easy to handle. They also help control spattering, improve aeration in baking, and can slightly slow oxidation, which helps protect flavor and aroma in some products.[^1]

## What foods contain Lecithins?
Lecithins show up in many everyday items. You will often find them in chocolate and compound coatings, biscuits and cakes, margarines and spreads, salad dressings and sauces, instant drink mixes, peanut butter, and powdered products where quick wetting is needed.[^1]

## What can replace Lecithins?
Depending on the job, other additives can stand in for lecithins.
- For emulsifying fats: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) in chocolate.
- For thickening or stabilizing water phases: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), or [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum).
- For dough strength and crumb: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate).
- For antioxidant support in certain foods: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) when appropriate.

## How is Lecithins made?
Manufacturers obtain lecithins by “degumming” edible oils such as soy or sunflower: water is mixed into crude oil, the phospholipids hydrate and separate, and the lecithin-rich fraction is removed and dried. It may be further processed (for example, filtered, fractionated, or de-oiled to a powder) and must meet identity and purity specifications set in EU law for E322.[^2] Lecithins used as food additives are defined as mixtures of phosphatides (phospholipids) from edible oilseeds or egg yolk produced by physical methods.[^2]

## Is Lecithins safe to eat?
In the United States, lecithin is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for use in food at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^3] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated E322 and found no safety concern for its current uses and use levels; a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^1]

GRAS means “Generally Recognized As Safe,” a U.S. term for substances widely accepted by experts as safe under their intended conditions of use. ADI means “acceptable daily intake,” the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Lecithins have any benefits?
Technically, lecithins make foods smoother, creamier, and easier to process, and can help reduce fat or cocoa butter needs in chocolate while keeping flow and snap. Nutritionally, lecithins contain phosphatidylcholine, which can supply choline—an essential nutrient—but the amounts contributed by typical food additive uses are small compared with overall daily needs.[^4]

## Who should avoid Lecithins?
If you have a soy or egg allergy, check labels and ask your clinician whether lecithin from those sources is appropriate for you. In the U.S., ingredients derived from major allergens—such as soy lecithin or egg lecithin—must be clearly named on food labels (with an exemption only for highly refined oils).[^5]

## Myths & facts
Here are a few common misunderstandings, cleared up.
- Myth: “Lecithin is a single chemical.” Fact: It is a mixture of phospholipids, not one pure compound.
- Myth: “All lecithin comes from soy.” Fact: Sunflower and egg lecithins are also common; source varies by product.
- Myth: “Lecithin is mainly a preservative.” Fact: Its main roles are emulsifying and stabilizing texture; any antioxidant effect is secondary.
- Myth: “E-numbers are synthetic chemicals.” Fact: E-numbers are simply codes for approved additives; lecithin can be from natural sources like soybeans or egg.

## Lecithins in branded foods
You can spot lecithins on ingredient lists as “soy lecithin,” “sunflower lecithin,” or just “lecithin.” They are common in chocolate bars and chips, bakery mixes, nut butters, powdered beverages, margarines, and ready-to-eat snacks. Different brands may choose different sources (soy or sunflower) based on supply, allergen policies, or product performance.
