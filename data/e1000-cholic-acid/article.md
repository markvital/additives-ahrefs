Cholic acid (E1000) is a bile acid that helps oil and water mix. In food technology, it can act as an emulsifier, but it is uncommon on modern ingredient lists and its uses are limited and regulated in many regions. It must meet strict specifications when used as a food additive.

## At a glance
- What it is: a bile acid listed as E1000 that can function as an emulsifier (a helper that lets oil and water mix).
- Label names: “cholic acid” or “E1000”.
- How common: rarely seen on everyday food labels; use is limited by regulation.
- What it does in foods: helps stabilize emulsions and disperses fats to improve texture.

## Why is Cholic acid added to food?
Cholic acid is amphipathic, meaning one side of the molecule “likes” water and the other side “likes” oil. That structure lets it act like a surfactant, forming tiny droplets and helping fats disperse in water-based foods, which is the same way bile acids help digest fats in the body.[^1]

## What foods contain Cholic acid?
You are unlikely to find E1000 in most supermarket products. Where permitted, it could appear in specialized emulsified foods or technical preparations. In the European Union (EU), food additives may only be used in specific food categories and under set conditions, so any use of E1000 is limited and controlled.[^2]

## What can replace Cholic acid?
Food makers normally choose more common emulsifiers and stabilizers instead of cholic acid, such as:
- [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (from soy, sunflower, or egg)
- [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate) and other sorbitan esters
- [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for chocolate and spreads
- Hydrocolloids like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) to thicken and stabilize
- Humectants and solvents such as [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) when moisture control is needed

## How is Cholic acid made?
In nature, cholic acid is a primary bile acid made in the liver from cholesterol. Its amphipathic structure allows it to form micelles that carry dietary fats and fat‑soluble compounds during digestion.[^1] When used as a food additive in the EU, it must meet identity and purity specifications laid down in law.[^3]

## Is Cholic acid safe to eat?
In the EU, additives must be authorized before use. The legal framework (Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008) allows additives only in specified foods and at levels needed for their function.[^2] Detailed composition and purity rules for each additive, including E1000 cholic acid, are published in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3] Safety evaluations are carried out by EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, before and during authorization.[^4]

## Does Cholic acid have any benefits?
Technologically, the benefit is simple: it helps oil and water stay mixed. By dispersing fats into tiny droplets, it can stabilize emulsions and improve texture or mouthfeel in suitable formulations, similar to how bile acids handle fats in human digestion.[^1]

## Who should avoid Cholic acid?
- If your clinician has advised you to limit certain emulsifiers or you follow a specialized diet, check labels and ask the manufacturer about ingredients.
- As with any additive, people with medical conditions should seek personalized advice from a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Cholic acid is the same as cholesterol. Fact: It is made from cholesterol in the body but is a different molecule that acts as a surfactant.
- Myth: E1000 is unregulated. Fact: In the EU, it has official specifications and any use is restricted to approved foods.[^2][^3]
- Myth: It always appears in everyday foods. Fact: It is an uncommon additive; many products use other emulsifiers instead.

## Cholic acid in branded foods
If E1000 is used, you will see “cholic acid” or “E1000” on the ingredient list. Because it is rarely used, many brands rely on alternatives like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids). Availability and labeling can vary by country, so always check the local ingredient list.
