Potassium tartrates (E336) are the potassium salts of tartaric acid. They include dipotassium tartrate and potassium hydrogen tartrate, better known to cooks as cream of tartar. They regulate acidity, help stabilize foams, and can drive leavening when paired with baking soda.

## At a glance

- What it is: The potassium salts of L(+)-tartaric acid; includes dipotassium tartrate and potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar).
- What it does: Acidity regulator, buffer, stabilizer; helps egg whites whip and prevents sugar crystallization; reacts with baking soda to release carbon dioxide.
- Where it’s used: Baking powders, meringues, candies and syrups, and other bakery and confectionery items.
- Safety: Authorized in the EU with specifications; EFSA re-evaluated tartrates and found no safety concern at reported uses. In the U.S., cream of tartar is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.

## Why is Potassium tartrates added to food?

Potassium tartrates control acidity and help foods keep a stable pH, which supports consistent taste and texture. As “cream of tartar,” they stabilize egg-white foams for meringues and soufflés and help prevent sugar syrups and candies from crystallizing. They also serve as the acid in some baking powders, reacting with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) to release carbon dioxide and lift baked goods.

## What foods contain Potassium tartrates?

You’ll most often see E336 in:
- Baking powders and self-rising flours
- Meringues, angel food cakes, and other whipped-egg desserts
- Caramels, fondants, and syrups that need smooth texture
- Some jellies, jams, and beverage syrups

Potassium hydrogen tartrate also occurs naturally as crystals in wine casks and bottles, though in that case it is not added as an ingredient.

## What can replace Potassium tartrates?

Possible substitutes depend on the job:
- For acidity regulation or tartness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid)
- For leavening systems: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) or selected [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) paired with baking soda
- For similar tartrate chemistry: [sodium tartrates](/e335-sodium-tartrates) or [calcium tartrate](/e354-calcium-tartrate)

Note that swapping acids can change flavor, reaction speed, and dough handling, so recipes and formulations may need adjustment.

## How is Potassium tartrates made?

In the EU, E336 covers the potassium salts of L(+)-tartaric acid only, and products must meet strict identity and purity specifications.[^1] They are typically obtained by neutralizing food-grade L(+)-[tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) with a potassium base. Full neutralization yields dipotassium tartrate; partial neutralization yields potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar). Winemaking by-products rich in natural tartrates are a common source of L(+)-tartaric acid used for these salts.[^1]

## Is Potassium tartrates safe to eat?

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated L(+)-tartaric acid and its salts (E334–E337) and concluded there is no safety concern for consumers at the reported uses and levels of exposure.[^2] In the United States, potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar) is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as GRAS—Generally Recognized As Safe—when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

As with any acidulant, very high use can make foods taste overly sour, and excessive intake is not expected in normal diets.

## Does Potassium tartrates have any benefits?

There are no special health benefits. The advantages are culinary and technical:
- More stable foams in whipped egg whites
- Smoother candies and syrups with less crystallization
- Reliable leavening when combined with baking soda

These functions can improve texture, volume, and consistency in finished foods.

## Who should avoid Potassium tartrates?

Potassium tartrates contribute potassium. People who must limit potassium—such as some individuals with kidney disease or those advised by their clinician to restrict potassium—should monitor overall dietary potassium from all sources.[^4] If you are on a potassium-restricted diet or take potassium-sparing medications, ask your healthcare provider about suitable limits.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “Cream of tartar is dairy.” Fact: Despite the name, it contains no cream. It’s the potassium acid salt of tartaric acid.
- Myth: “Tartrates are synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Food-grade tartrates are the salts of L(+)-tartaric acid, which is widely obtained from wine-making by-products; their composition and purity are controlled by EU specifications.[^1]
- Myth: “All baking powders use cream of tartar.” Fact: Some do, but many use acids like [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) or [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) for tailored reaction profiles.

## Potassium tartrates in branded foods

On ingredient lists you may see “potassium tartrate,” “potassium hydrogen tartrate,” “cream of tartar,” or “E336.” They most often appear on bakery items, meringue mixes, baking powders, and certain candies and syrups. If you are tracking additives, look for the E-number (E336) or the specific salt name.
