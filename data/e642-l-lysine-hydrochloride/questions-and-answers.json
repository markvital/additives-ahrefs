      "a": "That refers to TLCK, a lab reagent, not the food additive E642. L‑lysine hydrochloride (E642) is typically stored dry at room temperature in airtight containers—not frozen—and remains stable for long periods if kept cool and dry.",

      "q": "how long freeze nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride ≥96% (tlc), powder",
      "a": "This is about TLCK, not the food additive E642. E642 (L‑lysine hydrochloride) is stored dry at ambient conditions in sealed packaging and does not require freezing; it’s stable when kept cool and dry.",

      "q": "what does l lysine hydrochloride do",
      "a": "In foods it acts mainly as a flavor enhancer (E642), subtly boosting savory/sweet notes, and as a source of the essential amino acid lysine for fortification.",

      "q": "what is difference between l lysine hydrochloride and lysine mono hydrochloride",
      "a": "None—“L‑lysine hydrochloride” and “L‑lysine monohydrochloride” are the same salt (E642); the latter just specifies one equivalent of HCl.",
