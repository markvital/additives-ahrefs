Maltitol (E965) is a sugar alcohol that tastes close to table sugar but has fewer calories. It is used to sweeten and add bulk to sugar‑free and “no added sugar” foods, especially candies and baked goods. It also helps keep products moist.

## At a glance
Maltitol is a versatile sweetener used in many sugar‑free products.

- E-number: E965 (maltitol and maltitol syrup)
- What it does: sweetens, adds bulk, and helps keep moisture
- Tastes about as sweet as sugar, with fewer calories
- Common in sugar‑free chocolates, candies, chewing gum, and baked goods
- Too much at once can cause gas, bloating, or a laxative effect
- Not zero‑calorie; it counts toward carbs and calories

## Why is maltitol added to food?
Maltitol gives sweetness and texture similar to sugar, so recipes need fewer changes. It also holds water, which helps keep foods soft and fresh for longer. In the European Union (EU), E965 covers two forms: crystalline maltitol and maltitol syrup; both are used as sweeteners and bulking agents in different types of foods.[^1]

## What foods contain maltitol?
You’ll often find maltitol in:
- Sugar‑free or reduced‑sugar chocolates, toffees, and hard candies
- Chewing gum and mints
- Baked goods like cookies, cakes, and protein bars
- Dessert toppings, fillings, and ice cream
- “No added sugar” jams and spreads

On labels, look for “maltitol,” “maltitol syrup,” or “E965.”

## What can replace maltitol?
Depending on the recipe, manufacturers may swap maltitol with:
- Other polyol (sugar alcohol) sweeteners: [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), or [isomalt](/e953-isomalt)
- High‑intensity sweeteners for stronger sweetness: [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides), or [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k)
- Bulking syrups: [polyglycitol syrup](/e964-polyglycitol-syrup)

Each option changes taste, cooling effect, browning, and digestive tolerance, so blends are common.

## How is maltitol made?
Manufacturers start with starch (often from corn or wheat), break it down to maltose, then hydrogenate (add hydrogen to) the maltose to form maltitol. The EU sets detailed specifications for both E965(i) maltitol and E965(ii) maltitol syrup, including how they are produced and their composition.[^1]

## Is maltitol safe to eat?
Maltitol is an authorized food additive in the EU with official purity specifications under E965.[^1] In the United States, it is treated as a “sugar alcohol” for labeling and nutrition purposes under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). It can cause digestive upset if you eat a lot at once. In the EU, foods with more than 10% added polyols must carry the statement “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects.”[^2]

## Does maltitol have any benefits?
- Fewer calories than sugar: For U.S. labeling, sugar alcohols (including maltitol) are counted at 2.4 kcal per gram, lower than sugar’s 4 kcal per gram.[^3]
- Tooth‑friendly: FDA regulations allow a health claim that sugar alcohols do not promote tooth decay when products meet the criteria in 21 CFR 101.80.[^4]
- Sugar‑like performance: Maltitol provides bulk and browning closer to sugar than many other low‑calorie sweeteners, which helps in candies and baked goods.

## Who should avoid maltitol?
- People sensitive to sugar alcohols: If you tend to get gas, bloating, or diarrhea from polyols, start with small amounts. The EU requires a laxative‑effect warning when added polyols exceed 10% of a food, reflecting this concern.[^2]
- Young children: They may be more sensitive to large single servings.
- Anyone on a medically restricted diet: Maltitol still provides calories and carbohydrates. People managing diabetes should include it in their carb and calorie counts and consult a healthcare professional if unsure.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- “Maltitol is zero‑calorie.” False. Sugar alcohols are counted at 2.4 kcal/g for U.S. labels.[^3]
- “You can eat unlimited maltitol.” Not wise. Eating too much at once can cause a laxative effect; EU labels must warn about this for foods high in added polyols.[^2]
- “Maltitol is just artificial sugar.” Not exactly. It is made by converting maltose (from starch) through hydrogenation and has EU purity specifications as E965.[^1]

## maltitol in branded foods
You can spot maltitol on ingredient lists as “maltitol,” “maltitol syrup,” or “E965.” It shows up widely in sugar‑free chocolates, candies, mints, chewing gum, protein bars, baked goods, and some “no added sugar” ice creams and spreads. Many major brands use it in their sugar‑free lines; check the nutrition facts and ingredients to see how much is present and to gauge your own tolerance.
