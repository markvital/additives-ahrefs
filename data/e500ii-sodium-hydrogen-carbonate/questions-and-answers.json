      "q": "what does baking soda do",
      "a": "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, E500ii) releases carbon dioxide when it meets acid and heat, so batters and doughs rise and brown. Its alkalinity also neutralizes acidity and can tenderize mixtures.",

      "q": "what's the difference between baking soda and baking powder",
      "a": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs an added acid and moisture to produce gas. Baking powder already contains baking soda plus acidic salts and starch, so it activates on its own and is usually weaker by volume.",

      "q": "can i use baking soda instead of baking powder",
      "a": "You can substitute if you add your own acid—about 1/4 teaspoon baking soda plus 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar equals 1 teaspoon baking powder. Without enough acid the baked goods may taste soapy and rise poorly.",

      "q": "does baking soda go bad",
      "a": "Sodium bicarbonate is stable and doesn’t spoil, but once opened it can slowly lose leavening power as it absorbs moisture or odors. If a spoonful no longer fizzes strongly in vinegar or lemon juice, replace it for baking.",

    {
      "q": "can i use baking powder instead of baking soda",
      "a": "Baking powder can replace baking soda, but you usually need about three times as much and results may be less brown and crisp. If the recipe already includes an acid, reduce that slightly to avoid an overly tart flavor.",
