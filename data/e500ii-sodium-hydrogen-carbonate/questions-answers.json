      "question": "What does baking soda do?",
      "answer": "It’s a leavening agent and acidity regulator: when it reacts with an acid and heat, it releases CO2 that makes batters and doughs rise. It also raises pH, promoting browning and a crisper texture.",

      "question": "What's the difference between baking soda and baking powder?",
      "answer": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs an acidic ingredient to work. Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate plus acids and starch, often double-acting to release gas when moistened and again when heated.",

      "question": "Can i use baking soda instead of baking powder?",
      "answer": "Yes—add an acid: for each 1 tsp baking powder, use about 1/4 tsp baking soda plus 1/2 tsp cream of tartar (or another acid), adjusting liquids if using buttermilk/yogurt/lemon juice. Without added acid, it won’t rise properly and can taste soapy.",

      "question": "Does baking soda go bad?",
      "answer": "It doesn’t spoil, but it loses leavening strength after opening—best within about 6 months. Test by adding some to vinegar or lemon juice; vigorous fizz means it’s still active.",

    {
      "question": "Can i use baking powder instead of baking soda?",
      "answer": "Often, yes—use roughly 3 times as much baking powder as baking soda and, if possible, reduce other acidic ingredients to avoid tartness. Expect a slight change in flavor/texture due to added starch and acids.",
