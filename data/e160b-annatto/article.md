Annatto (E160b) is a natural yellow‑orange food color made from the seeds of the achiote tree. It lends warm, consistent color to cheeses, baked goods, snacks, and many other foods, and appears on labels as annatto, annatto extract, bixin, or norbixin.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant-based color from Bixa orellana (achiote) seeds; main pigments are bixin (oil‑soluble) and norbixin (water‑soluble).
- What it does: adds stable yellow to orange shades to foods without much flavor.
- Common on labels: annatto, annatto extract, bixin, norbixin, achiote.
- Typical foods: cheddar and other cheeses, dairy spreads, baked goods, cereals, snacks, desserts.
- Status: permitted as a food color in the U.S. and EU (E160b).
- Tolerance: most people can eat it; rare hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

## Why is Annatto added to food?
Annatto is used to give foods a bright, even yellow‑to‑orange color, especially when natural color is desired. It comes from achiote seeds and contains two key pigments, bixin and norbixin, which make oil‑ and water‑based coloring possible.[^1] In the United States, annatto extract is an approved color additive that is exempt from batch certification under 21 CFR 73.30.[^2]

## What foods contain Annatto?
You are most likely to find annatto in:
- Cheeses (for example, cheddar, Colby, Red Leicester), processed cheese, and cheese sauces
- Butter, margarine, and dairy spreads
- Baked goods, breakfast cereals, and snack foods
- Ice cream, frozen desserts, puddings, and custards
- Sausages and cured meats
- Sauces, dressings, and seasonings

On ingredient lists it may appear as “annatto,” “annatto extract,” “bixin,” or “norbixin.”

## What can replace Annatto?
Depending on the shade and recipe, food makers may use:
- [Beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) for yellow‑orange hues
- [Paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for orange‑red tones
- [Curcumin](/e100-curcumin) (turmeric extract) for bright yellow
- [Lycopene](/e160d-lycopene) for orange‑red
- [Caramel](/e150-caramel) for brownish tones
- In non-food-contact coatings, some industries once used [titanium dioxide](/e171-titanium-dioxide) for white opacity, but it does not replace annatto’s warm color in foods

## How is Annatto made?
Manufacturers extract color from ground achiote seeds with food‑grade solvents to obtain bixin, an oil‑soluble pigment suitable for fat‑rich foods.[^2] Treating the extract with alkali converts bixin to norbixin salts, which can be neutralized to make water‑dispersible forms better suited to beverages, dairy, and other aqueous foods.[^1] In the EU, specifications define several annatto extract types (bixin‑ and norbixin‑based) and set purity criteria for solvents, residuals, and composition.[^1]

## Is Annatto safe to eat?
Regulators have evaluated annatto’s safety and allow it to be used as a food color within established conditions. In the U.S., annatto extract is permitted for general foods and is listed as a color additive exempt from certification.[^2] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also lists annatto on its Color Additive Status List as “exempt from certification.”[^4] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed annatto extracts (E160b) and set acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) for the main extract types, concluding they are safe at current uses and levels.[^3]

ADI means Acceptable Daily Intake, a safety limit used by risk assessors. EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority, and FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

## Does Annatto have any benefits?
Annatto provides a familiar, appealing color that helps foods look consistent from batch to batch. It is valued because it colors well at low levels, works in both fat‑rich and water‑based foods, and has a mild taste that does not distract from the food itself.

## Who should avoid Annatto?
Most people tolerate annatto. However, EFSA noted rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions (such as hives or itching) after exposure to annatto extracts.[^3] If you have a known sensitivity to food colors or have had reactions to annatto before, consult a healthcare professional and check labels carefully.

Annatto is plant‑derived and typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets. If you follow specific religious or dietary practices, check product or certification details as usual.

## Myths & facts
- “Natural colors are always safer than artificial ones.” Natural and synthetic colors are both regulated and assessed for safety; “natural” does not automatically mean risk‑free.
- “Annatto is the same as saffron.” False. Saffron is a spice from crocus stigmas; annatto is a color from achiote seeds and has a different flavor and chemistry.
- “Annatto always makes food taste different.” Annatto is used at low levels and is valued for having little flavor impact in most foods.

## Annatto in branded foods
Here is how you might see it on real‑world labels:
- “Cheddar cheese (milk, cultures, salt, enzymes, annatto)”
- “Margarine (vegetable oils, water, salt, emulsifier, annatto color)”
- “Ice cream (milk, cream, sugar, stabilizers, annatto extract for color)”
- “Snack crackers (wheat flour, vegetable oil, seasonings, annatto and paprika for color)”

If you want to avoid it, scan ingredient lists for “annatto,” “annatto extract,” “bixin,” or “norbixin.”
