      "q": "what is microcrystalline wax made of",
      "a": "A mineral wax refined from petroleum residuals (de-oiled petrolatum), composed mainly of high–molecular-weight saturated hydrocarbons with branched and cyclic structures.",

      "q": "1 pound of microcrystalline wax weighs how much in everdur bronze",
      "a": "For the same volume, Everdur bronze (≈8.3–8.7 g/cm³) is about 9–10× denser than microcrystalline wax (≈0.90–0.95 g/cm³), so 1 lb of wax volume would weigh roughly 9–10 lb if cast in Everdur.",

    {
      "q": "at what temperature does microcrystalline wax melt",
      "a": "Typically about 60–90°C (140–194°F), depending on the grade; some hard grades approach ~95°C (203°F).",

    {
      "q": "how to determine the crystallinity of microcrystalline wax",
      "a": "Use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate crystalline fraction from melting enthalpy and X‑ray diffraction (XRD/WAXS) to quantify crystalline versus amorphous phases; FTIR can provide supportive qualitative insight.",

    {
      "q": "how to make dark microcrystalline paste wax",
      "a": "Melt microcrystalline wax (optionally with 10–20% carnauba for hardness), then blend in odorless mineral spirits or turpentine to a paste consistency and disperse a small amount of carbon black or iron oxide pigment for color; mix thoroughly and cool, observing strict solvent fire-safety.",
