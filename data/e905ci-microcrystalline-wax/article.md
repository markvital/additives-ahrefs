Microcrystalline wax (E905ci) is a highly refined wax made from petroleum. In food, it works mostly as a glazing and anti-sticking agent, giving a shiny finish and helping foods keep their texture. You’ll see it used in small amounts on the surface of candies and in chewing gum base.

## At a glance
- Role: glazing agent, surface sealer, and anti-sticking aid
- Typical uses: chewing gum base, shiny coatings on sugar confectionery
- Source: refined from petroleum; food-grade with strict purity specs
- Heat-stable, neutral taste, and largely inert in the body
- Approved for specified uses in the EU and the U.S.

## Why is microcrystalline wax added to food?
Manufacturers add microcrystalline wax to make surfaces glossy, reduce stickiness, and slow moisture loss. In the European Union, it is authorized as a glazing and surface treatment agent for certain foods, which is why it appears on polished confectionery and similar items.[^3] In the United States, food-grade petroleum waxes (which include microcrystalline wax) are permitted for specified uses in or on food under federal regulations.[^2]

## What foods contain microcrystalline wax?
You’re most likely to find it in:
- Chewing gum, where it can be part of the gum base to improve chew and reduce stickiness[^1]
- Shiny sugar confectionery and similar coated sweets
- Some specialty coatings where a moisture or oxygen barrier is useful

It is used in very small amounts and usually appears on labels as “microcrystalline wax,” “E905ci,” or “E905c(i).”

## What can replace microcrystalline wax?
Depending on the food and the desired finish, common substitutes include:
- [Carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) (plant-derived; very hard, high-gloss)
- [Candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) (plant-derived; firm, good gloss)
- [White and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) (animal-derived; softer film)
- [Shellac](/e904-shellac) (resin; strong, glossy coating)
- [Paraffin wax](/e905cii-paraffin-wax) or [synthetic wax](/e905-synthetic-wax) in certain technical applications

Choice depends on gloss, hardness, melting point, and whether plant-based or animal-derived ingredients are preferred.

## How is microcrystalline wax made?
Microcrystalline wax comes from the later stages of petroleum refining. Producers separate waxy fractions during “dewaxing,” then further refine them—such as by bleaching and other purification steps—to meet food-grade specifications.[^2] In the EU, detailed identity and purity requirements are laid out in the additive specifications, which limit impurities and define acceptable characteristics for E905c.[^4]

## Is microcrystalline wax safe to eat?
Regulators allow microcrystalline wax only when it meets strict purity standards and is used at levels needed to achieve its technical effect. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated microcrystalline wax as a food additive and did not identify safety concerns at authorized uses and levels.[^3] In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits food-grade petroleum waxes for specified uses in or on foods, reflecting a long history of safe use under these conditions.[^2]

## Does microcrystalline wax have any benefits?
Yes—mainly technological benefits:
- Protects texture by slowing moisture loss
- Gives a uniform glossy appearance
- Helps pieces (like sugar-coated candies) avoid sticking together
- Can aid handling on manufacturing lines and during packaging

## Who should avoid microcrystalline wax?
Most people do not need to avoid it. Those who prefer to limit petroleum-derived additives, or who follow certain product standards for personal reasons, can choose foods coated with plant-based waxes like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) instead. When in doubt, check the ingredient list for “E905ci,” “microcrystalline wax,” or a listed alternative.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just candle wax.” Fact: Food-grade microcrystalline wax is a different petroleum fraction from common candle paraffin and must meet strict identity and purity specifications before use in food.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s not approved anywhere.” Fact: FDA regulations allow food-grade petroleum waxes for specified uses in or on food.[^2]
- Myth: “Regulators haven’t reviewed it.” Fact: EFSA has formally reviewed microcrystalline wax as a food additive in the EU.[^3]

## Microcrystalline wax in branded foods
On labels, look for “microcrystalline wax,” “E905c,” or “E905ci.” It often appears:
- In chewing gum ingredient lists as part of the “gum base”
- Near the end of ingredient lists for glossy, sugar-coated candies and similar products
- In glaze or polishing component lists for confectionery

If you prefer to avoid it, look for products that specify coatings like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), or [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) instead.
