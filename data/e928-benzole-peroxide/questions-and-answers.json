      "q": "how does benzole peroxide reduce acne",
      "a": "As a topical drug, benzoyl peroxide reduces acne by releasing oxygen that kills acne-causing bacteria and helps keep pores from clogging; as a food additive (E928) it’s used to bleach flour, not to treat acne.",

      "q": "how does benzole peroxide work?",
      "a": "In foods, benzoyl peroxide (E928) is a strong oxidizing flour-bleaching/maturing agent that whitens flour pigments and then breaks down mainly to benzoic acid and oxygen.",

      "q": "how to prevent bleached eyebrows benzole peroxide",

      "q": "how to use benzole peroxide",
      "a": "In food processing, small regulated amounts are uniformly blended into flour to bleach and mature it; for topical acne products, follow the label and start with lower strengths due to irritation and bleaching risk.",

      "q": "what store sells benzole peroxide shampoo",
      "a": "Benzoyl peroxide is uncommon in human shampoos (it can bleach hair) and is mainly sold as acne washes at pharmacies or online; as E928 it’s an industrial flour-bleaching aid, not a consumer shampoo.",

    {
      "q": "what does benzoyl peroxide do",
      "a": "In foods, E928 (benzoyl peroxide) is a flour-treatment/bleaching agent that whitens flour and can slightly improve dough handling; it decomposes during processing so very little remains in the finished product.",

      "q": "does benzoyl peroxide bleach skin",

    {
      "q": "does benzoyl peroxide cause purging",
      "a": "No; the tiny amounts used in flour don’t cause skin “purging”—that term relates to topical acne treatments, which is unrelated to food use.",

    {
      "q": "how benzoyl peroxide works",
      "a": "It acts as a strong oxidizing agent, releasing oxygen that bleaches yellow carotenoid pigments in flour; in the process it breaks down mainly to benzoic acid/benzoate.",

    {
      "q": "is benzoyl peroxide safe",
      "a": "At approved levels for flour bleaching in some countries, it’s considered safe and leaves minimal residues as benzoic acid; it is not permitted for this use in the EU.",
