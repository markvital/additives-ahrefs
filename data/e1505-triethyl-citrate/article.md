Triethyl citrate (E1505) is a clear, almost odorless liquid made by combining citric acid with ethanol. In foods, it works mainly as a carrier for flavors and colors, a mild emulsifier, and a plasticizer that helps coatings stay flexible.

## At a glance
- What it is: the triethyl ester of citric acid, a clear liquid with a slightly fruity taste
- What it does: carrier/solvent, emulsifier, stabiliser, sequestrant (binds metal ions), and plasticizer in coatings
- Where you’ll see it: flavor preparations, beverage emulsions, confectionery and chewing gum coatings, and color concentrates
- Label names: “Triethyl citrate,” “E1505”

## Why is Triethyl citrate added to food?
Food makers use triethyl citrate because it solves practical problems in recipes and processing. As a carrier (or solvent), it helps dissolve and evenly spread flavors and colors. As a mild emulsifier and stabiliser, it helps oil and water stay mixed a bit longer. It can also act as a sequestrant, which means it binds trace metals that might otherwise speed up off-flavors. In coatings and glazes, it serves as a plasticizer, keeping films flexible rather than brittle.[^1] [^2]

## What foods contain Triethyl citrate?
You’ll most often find E1505 in:
- Flavor and color preparations (to carry and disperse the active ingredient)
- Soft drinks and other beverages that use oil-based flavor emulsions
- Confectionery and sugar-shell coatings, including some chewing gum dragees and glazes (to keep the coating from cracking)
- Bakery decorations and sprinkles
- Specialty diet or sports products where stable flavor systems are needed

On labels, it may appear as “triethyl citrate” or “E1505.”

## What can replace Triethyl citrate?
Possible substitutes depend on the job it’s doing:
- As a carrier/solvent: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol), or [polyethylene glycol](/e1521-polyethylene-glycol)
- As a plasticizer for coatings: [glyceryl triacetate](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate) and, in some systems, [shellac](/e904-shellac) with a suitable plasticizer
- As an emulsifier/stabiliser in foods: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate), or polysorbates such as [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate)

Formulators choose alternatives based on taste impact, solubility, label needs, and local rules.

## How is Triethyl citrate made?
Triethyl citrate is produced by esterifying [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with [ethanol](/e1510-ethanol), followed by purification to meet food-grade specifications. In the European Union, its identity and purity (including limits for contaminants) are set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1]

## Is Triethyl citrate safe to eat?
Triethyl citrate is authorized for use as a food additive in the EU, with official specifications that control its purity and how it is identified.[^1] In the United States, it is listed among synthetic flavoring substances and adjuvants permitted for direct addition to food in line with good manufacturing practice, which means only the amount needed to do its job may be used.[^2] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Food Additive Status List also includes triethyl citrate with the relevant regulatory citation.[^3]

These regulatory listings are based on safety evaluations and on the chemistry of the ingredient. Triethyl citrate is the triester of a common food acid (citric acid) and food-grade ethanol, and it is used at low levels to carry or stabilize other ingredients.[^2] As with all additives, manufacturers must follow the applicable limits and quality specs.

## Does Triethyl citrate have any benefits?
For food makers, it brings several practical benefits:
- Helps flavors and colors dissolve and mix evenly
- Improves stability in some beverage emulsions
- Keeps coatings flexible, reducing cracking or flaking
- Can bind trace metals, which may help slow flavor deterioration

For consumers, the result is more consistent taste and texture, especially in flavored drinks and coated sweets.

## Who should avoid Triethyl citrate?
There are no specific groups that are required to avoid E1505 under current regulations. People who prefer to limit certain additives or who follow strict ingredient policies can check labels for “triethyl citrate” or “E1505.” If you have questions about additives in a medical diet, ask a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are unsafe chemicals.” Fact: E-numbers identify additives that have been reviewed and authorized for use in the EU with strict purity rules.[^1]
- Myth: “Triethyl citrate is the same as citric acid.” Fact: It is made from citric acid and ethanol, but it is a different compound with different functions.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s a phthalate plasticizer.” Fact: Triethyl citrate is a citrate ester, not a phthalate, and it is approved for specific food uses.[^2] [^3]

## Triethyl citrate in branded foods
E1505 shows up most often in ingredient lists for:
- Sugar-coated or polished confectionery (including some chewing gums)
- Ready-to-drink beverages using flavor emulsions
- Flavor or color concentrates used by food manufacturers

On packaging, look for “triethyl citrate” or “E1505.” Its presence can vary by brand and by country, depending on recipe and local regulations.
