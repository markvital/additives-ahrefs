Black iron oxide (E172i) is a food color that gives a deep gray to black shade. It is a synthetic mineral pigment based on iron oxide, often referred to as magnetite. Food makers use it in small amounts when they want a stable, strong black tone.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic mineral color, iron(II,III) oxide (magnetite), used as E172i.
- What it does: provides a deep black or gray color that holds up to heat and light.
- Where it’s found: mainly in confectionery coatings and decorations; availability varies by country.
- Safety: reviewed in the EU with no safety concern at typical use levels; iron from this pigment is poorly absorbed.
- Other names: “iron oxides and hydroxides” may also appear on labels.

## Why is Black iron oxide added to food?
Black iron oxide gives a true black or charcoal tone that does not fade easily during processing or storage. It is essentially insoluble, so the color stays in place and does not bleed into surrounding layers, which is helpful for coatings, dragees, and decorative details.[^1]

## What foods contain Black iron oxide?
You may find E172i in black-coated candies, chocolate decorations, cake toppings, and other specialty confectionery. It can also appear in colored pastes or icings used for fine details on baked goods. Exact uses depend on local rules and on the product style chosen by each maker.

## What can replace Black iron oxide?
- Vegetable carbon [E153] can achieve a deep black and is common in “charcoal” colored products.[^1]  
  See: [vegetable carbon](/e153-vegetable-carbon)
- For brown-to-black shades, some formulators use [caramel](/e150-caramel) colors.
- White-to-gray effects have sometimes been made by blending black with white pigments such as [titanium dioxide](/e171-titanium-dioxide), though titanium dioxide is no longer permitted as a food additive in the European Union.[^3]

## How is Black iron oxide made?
Food-grade iron oxides and hydroxides, including the black form, are produced synthetically by controlled chemical processes that convert iron salts into the final oxide pigment.[^2] Manufacturing aims for consistent particle size, purity, and color tone suited to food use.[^1]

## Is Black iron oxide safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated iron oxides and hydroxides (E 172) and concluded they are not of safety concern at the reported uses and use levels in food.[^1] The EU also sets specifications that limit impurities such as lead, arsenic, and mercury to protect consumers.[^2]

## Does Black iron oxide have any benefits?
Black iron oxide offers technical benefits: stable color, good coverage, and resistance to heat and light. It is not intended as a nutrient, and the iron it contains is poorly absorbed from the gut, so it does not act like an iron supplement.[^1]

## Who should avoid Black iron oxide?
Most people do not need to avoid E172i. If you have a rare iron-overload condition (such as hemochromatosis), ask your healthcare provider about your overall iron exposure. That said, EFSA considers iron from this pigment to be of low bioavailability, so it contributes little to dietary iron.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as taking an iron supplement.”  
  Fact: The pigment form is poorly absorbed and is not a meaningful source of dietary iron.[^1]
- Myth: “It must contain dangerous heavy metals.”  
  Fact: Food-grade E172 must meet strict EU specifications that cap contaminants like lead and arsenic.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s a nano colorant.”  
  Fact: EFSA asked for tighter information on particle size in specifications; food-grade material is controlled for its size distribution.[^1]

## Black iron oxide in branded foods
Label it like a detective: look for “E172,” “E172i,” or “iron oxides and hydroxides” on the ingredient list. You’re most likely to see it on black-dyed candies, decorative sprinkles or coatings, and specialty bakery decorations. Availability can differ by market, so products sold in one country may use different colors elsewhere.
