Acetylated distarch phosphate (E1414) is a modified starch used to thicken, stabilize, and sometimes emulsify foods. It is made by adding small acetyl groups and a few phosphate cross‑links to plant starch so it stays smooth through heating, mixing, freezing, and thawing.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant-based modified starch with acetyl and phosphate groups added
- What it does: thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier that holds texture under heat, acid, and freeze–thaw
- Where it’s found: soups, sauces and gravies, pie and fruit fillings, dairy desserts, ready meals, and gluten‑free baking
- Label names: “acetylated distarch phosphate,” “E1414,” or in the U.S. often “modified food starch”
- Dietary notes: vegan and vegetarian; can be made from corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat starch—people with wheat allergy or celiac disease should check labels
- Regulatory status: authorised in the EU and permitted in the U.S. under good manufacturing practice

## Why is acetylated distarch phosphate added to food?
Manufacturers use E1414 to keep foods thick and stable when they face heat, shear (strong mixing), acid, or freezing. The acetyl groups help prevent the starch from gelling too hard or breaking, while the phosphate cross‑links strengthen the granules, so sauces stay smooth and frozen meals resist “weeping” after thawing.[^1]

## What foods contain acetylated distarch phosphate?
You may find it in:
- Canned and instant soups, sauces, and gravies
- Pie fillings, fruit preps, puddings, and custards
- Ready meals and frozen entrees
- Noodles and gluten‑free baked goods

On ingredient lists it can appear as “acetylated distarch phosphate,” “E1414” (in many countries), or simply “modified food starch” in the United States, where “food starch‑modified” is the permitted ingredient name.[^2]

## What can replace acetylated distarch phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- Other modified starches: [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate), [acetylated starch](/e1420-acetylated-starch), or [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate) for heat/acid or freeze–thaw stability
- Gums and hydrocolloids: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) to build viscosity or gel structure
- Other modified starch types: [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch) or [phosphated distarch phosphate](/e1413-phosphated-distarch-phosphate) for specific textures

## How is acetylated distarch phosphate made?
E1414 starts with edible starch (often corn, potato, wheat, or tapioca). The starch is treated with permitted reagents to add:
- Acetyl groups (commonly using acetic anhydride or vinyl acetate)
- Phosphate cross‑links (commonly using phosphorus oxychloride or sodium trimetaphosphate)

After reaction, the starch is washed, filtered, and dried to remove residual reagents, and it must meet strict purity and specification limits before use.[^2] In the EU, E1414 is defined as distarch phosphate that also contains a small amount of acetyl groups, with specification limits set in law.[^4]

## Is acetylated distarch phosphate safe to eat?
Regulators in the European Union and the United States have reviewed modified starches and found no safety concern at approved uses and levels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that modified starches, including E1414, are digested similarly to regular starch and do not raise safety concerns at typical intakes.[^1] The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assigned modified starches an “ADI not specified,” meaning there is no need for a numerical daily limit at normal use levels.[^3]

Some people may notice mild digestive effects (like soft stools or gas) if they consume large amounts, as can happen with any starch.[^1]

## Does acetylated distarch phosphate have any benefits?
For food makers and home cooks, E1414 can:
- Keep sauces and fillings smooth after heating, cooling, and reheating
- Improve freeze–thaw stability in frozen foods
- Help gluten‑free recipes hold moisture and structure without becoming gummy[^1]

These are texture and stability benefits, not health benefits.

## Who should avoid acetylated distarch phosphate?
- People with wheat allergy or celiac disease: E1414 can be made from wheat starch. In the U.S., if wheat is the source, it must be declared on the label under allergen rules.[^5] If you need to avoid gluten, choose products that state gluten‑free or name a gluten‑free starch source.
- Very sensitive individuals: As with other starches, large servings may cause mild digestive discomfort.

E1414 is plant‑derived and suitable for vegan and vegetarian diets.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as MSG.” False. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer; E1414 is a modified starch used for texture.
- “It’s plastic or synthetic.” False. It is made from plant starch with small, well‑regulated chemical changes; the result still behaves like starch in digestion.[^1]
- “It’s banned in Europe.” False. It is authorised in the EU as E1414 with clear specifications.[^4]
- “It’s always gluten‑free.” Not necessarily. It can be made from wheat; in the U.S., wheat must be declared on the label.[^5]

## Acetylated distarch phosphate in branded foods
Many mainstream brands use E1414 in creamy soups, jarred sauces, fruit fillings, frozen meals, and dairy desserts. To spot it, check the ingredient list for “acetylated distarch phosphate,” “E1414,” or “modified food starch.” If you avoid wheat, look for a gluten‑free claim or a named non‑wheat source (such as corn or tapioca).
