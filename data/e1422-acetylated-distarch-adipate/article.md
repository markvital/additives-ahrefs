Acetylated distarch adipate (E1422) is a modified starch that thickens and stabilizes foods. It holds texture under heat, shear, freezing, and acidic conditions. Look for it on labels as “modified food starch” or “acetylated distarch adipate.”

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Acetylated distarch adipate; E1422
- What it does: Thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier
- Common in: Canned soups, sauces and gravies, salad dressings, pie fillings, puddings, frozen meals, baby foods, gluten-free baked goods
- Diet flags: Generally vegan and gluten-free; if you avoid wheat, check the allergen statement for “wheat”

1) Why it’s added to food
- It improves thickness and creamy mouthfeel. It stays stable during cooking, canning, and freezing, and helps prevent water separation.
- It works better than many native starches in acidic foods and during reheating. Choose products with E1422 if you want sauces that don’t “break.”

2) What foods it’s found in
- Ready-to-serve soups, jarred sauces and gravies, salad dressings, pie and pastry fillings, fruit preps, and puddings.
- Frozen entrées, baby foods, yogurts, and gluten-free baked goods often use it for stable texture.
- Check labels for “acetylated distarch adipate,” “modified food starch,” or “E1422.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Other starches: corn, potato, tapioca, rice starch; or other modified starches like acetylated distarch phosphate (E1414) and hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (E1442).
- Gums and hydrocolloids: xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin; gelatin in non-vegan foods.
- Shopping tips: Choose “no added modified starch” products or ones thickened with “tapioca starch,” “xanthan gum,” or “pectin” if you prefer simpler or gum-based options.

4) How acetylated distarch adipate is manufactured
- Food-grade plant starch (often corn, potato, or tapioca) is reacted under controlled conditions to add small numbers of crosslinks with adipic anhydride (from adipic acid).
- It is then acetylated, commonly using acetic anhydride, to improve stability. The starch is washed, neutralized, and dried to meet food specifications.

5) How safe is acetylated distarch adipate for consumption?
- E1422 is permitted in the U.S. as a “food starch-modified” when made with approved reagents and used under good manufacturing practice. Major evaluations in the U.S. and EU find no safety concern at typical intakes.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It has no direct therapeutic uses. It is a processing aid that improves texture and stability.
- In some reduced-fat foods, it can help replace fat for thickness, which may modestly lower calories per serving.

7) When acetylated distarch adipate may be unsafe (contraindications)
- If you have a wheat allergy, check the allergen statement. “Wheat” must be declared if wheat was the starch source.
- People following strict additive-free, grain-free, or medical diets should avoid products listing modified starches unless advised otherwise by a clinician.
- Very high intake may cause temporary digestive discomfort in some individuals, similar to other starches.

- Myth: “E1422 is a preservative.” Fact: It is a thickener/stabilizer and does not preserve food against microbes. Source: EFSA (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “Modified starch always contains gluten.” Fact: Most are from corn, potato, or tapioca; if wheat is used, “wheat” must appear on the label. Source: FDA.gov — Allergen labeling (URL to be added by editor)

Acetylated distarch adipate in Branded Foods
- You’ll see it in national-brand and store-brand soups, gravies, sauces, dressings, frozen entrées, pie fillings, and some gluten-free baked goods.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) What is acetylated distarch adipate (E1422)?
- It is a modified starch used to thicken and stabilize foods under heat, acid, and freezing. It helps prevent watery separation.

2) Is E1422 safe?
- Yes, major authorities have evaluated modified starches and found no safety concern at normal intake levels. It is allowed in the U.S. under FDA regulations.

3) Is E1422 gluten-free and vegan?
- It is generally gluten-free and plant-based. If wheat is the source, “wheat” will appear in the allergen statement.

4) Why do manufacturers use E1422 instead of regular starch?
- It holds texture better during cooking, canning, and freezing. It reduces syneresis (water-off) in sauces, fillings, and dressings.

5) How can I avoid E1422 when shopping?
- Check ingredient lists for “modified food starch,” “acetylated distarch adipate,” or “E1422.” Choose products thickened with “tapioca starch,” “xanthan gum,” or “no added modified starch.”
