      "q": "is propylene glycol safe",
      "a": "Yes—E1520 is authorized in the EU and considered GRAS by the FDA when used within limits; the ADI is 25 mg/kg body weight per day. Very high exposures (mainly from medicines), especially in infants or those with kidney/liver impairment, can cause adverse effects.",
