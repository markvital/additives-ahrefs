Dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate (E450iv) is a diphosphate salt used in foods to help dough rise, keep textures stable, and bind metal ions that can cause off-flavors. It’s a potassium-based alternative to sodium acid pyrophosphate that can reduce sodium in recipes while delivering the same functional lift.

## At a glance
This additive is a versatile helper in baked goods and processed foods.
- Roles: raising agent (leavening acid), stabiliser, sequestrant (binds metal ions), emulsifying salt, and humectant
- Typical in: baking mixes, self-rising flour, processed cheese, and some meat and poultry products
- Also called: potassium acid pyrophosphate; E-number E450iv
- Regulatory status: authorised in the EU within the group of phosphates (E 338–341, E 343, E 450–452) with specifications and use limits; EFSA sets a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates
- Dietary note: supplies potassium and phosphate; people who must limit phosphorus (for example, with chronic kidney disease) should be mindful of total intake

## Why is dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate added to food?
Manufacturers add it because it reliably releases acid during baking, which reacts with baking soda to produce gas and lift. It also binds trace metals that can otherwise affect color or flavor, helps maintain texture, and acts as an emulsifying salt in processed cheese to keep proteins and fats properly dispersed.[^1]

## What foods contain dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Baking powders, cake and pancake mixes, and self-rising flour (as a leavening acid)
- Processed cheese and cheese spreads (as an emulsifying salt within the phosphate group)
- Certain meat and poultry products where phosphates are permitted for functional purposes (such as moisture retention and pH control), typically alongside other phosphates[^1][^3]

## What can replace dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate?
Depending on the job you need it to do, common stand-ins include:
- Leavening acids: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [glucono-δ-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [monopotassium tartrate](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate)
- Other pyrophosphates in the same family (formulation-dependent): [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate) or [tetrasodium diphosphate](/e450iii-tetrasodium-diphosphate)
- Sequestrants and buffers in sauces and beverages: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate)

## How is dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate made?
Food-grade material is produced by neutralising food-grade phosphoric acid with potassium bases (such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate) and then carefully heating to condense phosphate units into pyrophosphate. The result is the acidic potassium pyrophosphate salt specified in EU additive rules (E 450iv).[^1][^2]

## Is dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate safe to eat?
Within approved uses, it is considered safe by European authorities as part of the wider phosphate group. EFSA established a group ADI of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day for all phosphate additives (E 338–341, E 343, E 450–452).[^1] EU specifications also define purity criteria for E 450(iv) to ensure consistent, food-grade quality.[^2]

## Does dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate have any benefits?
Functionally, it delivers predictable leavening in baked goods, stabilises textures, and can help reduce sodium when used in place of sodium-based pyrophosphates. In processed cheese, it helps achieve a smooth, sliceable texture without phase separation.[^1]

## Who should avoid dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate?
People who need to limit phosphorus—especially those with chronic kidney disease—are often advised to monitor dietary phosphate from both foods and additives. Work with a healthcare professional or dietitian if you’re on a phosphate-restricted plan.[^4] EFSA also noted that children can have relatively high exposure to phosphates across the diet, so prudent use across multiple foods is important.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All phosphates act like nutritional phosphorus supplements.” Fact: Food phosphates are used for technology (leavening, texture, emulsifying); they do contribute phosphate, but they’re not marketed or dosed as supplements.
- Myth: “Potassium acid pyrophosphate is just a preservative.” Fact: Its main roles are leavening, sequestration, and texture control; it is not a general antimicrobial.
- Myth: “If a label lists E450, it’s this exact compound.” Fact: E450 is a family. E450(iv) is the dipotassium dihydrogen pyrophosphate member; other E450 entries are different sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium diphosphates.

## dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “dipotassium dihydrogenpyrophosphate,” “potassium acid pyrophosphate,” “E450,” or the more specific “E450(iv).” You’ll most often find it in baking mixes and processed cheese. In meat and poultry products, it may appear alongside other phosphates when permitted.
