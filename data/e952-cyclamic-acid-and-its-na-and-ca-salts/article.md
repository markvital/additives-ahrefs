Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts (E952) are high‑intensity sweeteners used to give a sweet taste without adding sugar or calories. They are much sweeter than table sugar, so only tiny amounts are needed in foods and drinks. Rules vary by country: they are authorized in the EU but not approved for use in the United States.

## At a glance
- Role: high‑intensity sweetener used to cut sugar and calories
- Sweetness: roughly 30–50 times sweeter than table sugar
- Where it’s used: energy‑reduced soft drinks, tabletop sweeteners, and other low‑sugar or no‑added‑sugar foods (in the EU)
- Regulatory status: authorized in the EU as E952; not approved for use in U.S. foods
- Typical names on labels: E952, cyclamic acid, sodium cyclamate, calcium cyclamate

## Why is Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts added to food?
Food makers use E952 to provide sweetness with little or no calories. Because it is dozens of times sweeter than sugar, very small amounts can replace much larger amounts of sucrose in recipes.[^5] That helps reduce sugar, manage calories, and keep sweetness in products like diet soft drinks and tabletop sweeteners.

## What foods contain Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts?
In the European Union, E952 is authorized in a range of categories set by law. These include, for example, energy‑reduced or no‑added‑sugar beverages and tabletop sweeteners, among other specified foods and maximum levels.[^2] Exact uses and limits are listed in the EU “Union list” for food additives.

## What can replace Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts?
Depending on the recipe and local rules, food makers may use:
- [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k)
- [aspartame](/e951-aspartame)
- [sucralose](/e955-sucralose)
- [saccharin](/e954-saccharin-and-its-salts)
- [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides)
- [neotame](/e961-neotame) or [advantame](/e969-advantame)
- Sugar alcohols like [xylitol](/e967-xylitol) or [erythritol](/e968-erythritol)

Each sweetener has its own taste, stability, and labeling rules, so blends are common.

## How is Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts made?
E952 refers to the sodium and calcium salts of cyclamic acid (cyclohexylsulfamic acid). Commercial production yields high‑purity crystals or powder that are dissolved or blended into foods. In the EU, manufacturers must meet detailed purity specifications, including identity tests and strict limits for certain impurities (such as cyclohexylamine), before the additive can be placed on the market.[^4]

## Is Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has re‑evaluated E952 and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 7 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. EFSA concluded that cyclamates are not genotoxic or carcinogenic at authorized uses when intake stays within the ADI.[^1] In the body, most cyclamate is excreted unchanged; in some people, gut bacteria can convert a small part to cyclohexylamine, which was considered when EFSA set the ADI.[^5]

In the United States, cyclamate is not currently approved for use as a sweetener in foods; FDA lists only certain high‑intensity sweeteners as permitted, and cyclamate is not among them.[^3]

ADI means “acceptable daily intake,” a safety guideline for how much can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts have any benefits?
- Enables low‑sugar and energy‑reduced recipes without losing sweetness.
- Needs only small amounts, which can help keep taste stable over shelf life and across processing.
- Can be paired with other sweeteners to fine‑tune flavor and sweetness profile.

## Who should avoid Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts?
- People who choose to avoid non‑nutritive sweeteners for personal or medical reasons should read labels and pick products accordingly.
- Young children can reach the ADI with fewer servings because ADI is per kilogram of body weight; parents may wish to monitor total daily intake from multiple products.
- In the U.S., you generally won’t encounter E952 in foods because it is not approved; travelers should check labels when buying products from abroad.[^3]

If you have specific dietary needs, ask a healthcare professional for advice.

## Myths & facts
- “Cyclamate is banned everywhere.” No—E952 is authorized as a food additive in the European Union, subject to strict use levels.[^2] It is, however, not approved for use in U.S. foods.[^3]
- “The body turns all cyclamate into harmful chemicals.” Most cyclamate is excreted unchanged; only a small portion may be converted by gut bacteria to cyclohexylamine, which regulators consider in setting safe intake levels.[^5]
- “There’s no safety limit.” The EU uses an ADI of 7 mg/kg body weight per day for cyclamate, based on EFSA’s risk assessment.[^1]

## Cyclamic acid and its Na and Ca salts in branded foods
How to spot it on labels:
- Look for “E952,” “cyclamic acid,” “sodium cyclamate,” or “calcium cyclamate.”
- In the EU, you’ll mainly see it in energy‑reduced drinks and tabletop sweeteners. In the U.S., you should not see it in foods because it’s not an approved sweetener.[^3]
- Formulas change over time, so always check the current ingredient list.
