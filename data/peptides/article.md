Peptides are short sequences of amino acids engineered to signal specific responses in the skin. Depending on their structure, they can target firmness, hydration, or soothing benefits.

## Why it matters
- Signal peptides can encourage collagen and elastin production for firmer-looking skin.
- Some peptides strengthen the barrier by supporting lipid synthesis.
- Copper and neuropeptides can calm visible irritation from daily stressors.

## How to use it
- Layer peptide serums after cleansing and before occlusive creams morning and night.
- Combine with hyaluronic acid or ceramides to support overall barrier health.
- Avoid pairing copper peptides with direct vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) in the same routine if sensitivity occurs.
