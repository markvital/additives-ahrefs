      "q": "how much magnesium lactate should i take",
      "a": "Follow the product label and base dosing on elemental magnesium: adults typically need 310–420 mg/day total magnesium, and the tolerable upper limit from supplements is 350 mg/day of elemental magnesium. Magnesium lactate dihydrate is about 10% elemental magnesium, so 1,000 mg of the salt provides roughly 100 mg of magnesium.",
