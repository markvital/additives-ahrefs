Magnesium lactate (E329) is the magnesium salt of lactic acid. It helps keep foods at the right acidity and can add magnesium, an essential mineral, to fortified foods and supplements. It is approved in the European Union with defined purity specifications.

## At a glance
Here are the essentials.

- What it is: The magnesium salt of [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid)
- What it does: Acidity regulator (buffer) and source of magnesium
- Where it’s found: Fortified drinks and foods, powders or tablets, some baked goods and confections
- Dietary notes: Typically vegan-friendly; commercial lactic acid is usually made by fermenting sugars, not from milk
- Label names: “Magnesium lactate,” “E329”
- Status: Authorized in the EU with specifications; used in line with national regulations elsewhere

## Why is Magnesium lactate added to food?
Food makers use magnesium lactate to control acidity, which helps keep flavor and texture consistent over shelf life. As a magnesium source, it can also be added to fortify foods or beverages and to make chewable or swallowable tablets that deliver magnesium. When used as a buffer, it pairs well with other acids and salts such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) and its salts to steady pH in recipes.

## What foods contain Magnesium lactate?
You might see E329 on labels of:
- Fortified waters and hydration drinks
- Powdered drink mixes and effervescent tablets
- Nutrition bars, candies, and some bakery items
- Dietary supplements (tablets, capsules, powders)

In the European Union, authorized food categories and maximum levels for E329 can be looked up in the EU Food Additives Database, which lists where it may be used and under what conditions.[^1]

## What can replace Magnesium lactate?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- For acidity regulation or buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or its salts such as [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- For magnesium fortification: [magnesium chloride](/e511-magnesium-chloride), [magnesium sulfate](/e518-magnesium-sulphate), or [magnesium oxide](/e530-magnesium-oxide)
- For lactate-based functionality without magnesium: [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate), [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate), or [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate)

Each substitute changes taste, solubility, and pH behavior, so formulators often test small batches first.

## How is Magnesium lactate made?
In general, magnesium lactate is produced by neutralizing lactic acid with a magnesium base (such as magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate), followed by purification and drying to meet food-grade specifications.[^2] The lactic acid used for this step is typically produced by fermenting carbohydrates (like sugar or starch) with lactic acid bacteria, though chemical synthesis is also allowed under U.S. regulations.[^3]

## Is Magnesium lactate safe to eat?
Within approved uses and typical amounts in foods, magnesium lactate is considered safe. In the EU, it has an official specification as E329, which sets identity and purity criteria for food-grade material.[^2] For people taking magnesium from supplements or fortified products, health authorities in the United States set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 350 mg per day of magnesium from supplemental sources for adults; this limit does not include magnesium naturally present in foods.[^5]

## Does Magnesium lactate have any benefits?
Functionally, it helps control acidity and stabilize flavor. Nutritionally, it can supply magnesium, a mineral needed for energy metabolism, muscle and nerve function, and normal heart rhythm.[^5] As with any magnesium source, the benefit depends on the amount provided and a person’s overall diet.

## Who should avoid Magnesium lactate?
Most people can consume foods containing E329 without issues. Extra caution is sensible for:
- Individuals with kidney disease or significantly reduced kidney function, who may have trouble clearing excess magnesium and should follow medical advice on magnesium intake[^5]
- People who experience laxative effects from supplemental magnesium; some forms and higher doses can cause diarrhea or cramping[^5]
If you have a metabolic disorder affecting lactate handling, or you are on a magnesium-restricted diet, consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Because it says lactate, it comes from milk.”
  Fact: Food-grade lactic acid is commonly made by fermenting sugars with bacteria; it doesn’t require dairy ingredients.[^3]
- Myth: “All magnesium forms act the same.”
  Fact: Different magnesium salts vary in elemental magnesium content, taste, solubility, and digestive tolerance; formulators choose based on the application.[^5]
- Myth: “If a little is good, more is better.”
  Fact: Excess supplemental magnesium can cause gastrointestinal upset, and adults should stay within the 350 mg/day UL for magnesium from supplements unless advised otherwise by a clinician.[^5]

## Magnesium lactate in branded foods
On labels, look for “magnesium lactate” or “E329” in the ingredient list. In supplements, it usually appears in the “Supplement Facts” panel with the amount of elemental magnesium per serving. Fortified beverages and bars may use it to add magnesium with a neutral taste and steady pH. If you’re tracking magnesium intake, check serving sizes and how many servings you consume in a day.
