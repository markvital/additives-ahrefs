Erythrosine (E127), also known as FD&C Red No. 3, is a bright cherry-pink synthetic food color. It is approved for use in many foods in the United States and allowed only in a few specific cherry products in the European Union.

## At a glance
- What it is: A synthetic red dye that gives a vivid pink-red hue.
- What it does: Colors foods to make them look consistent and appealing.
- Where it’s used: Widely permitted in U.S. foods; in the EU it is limited to certain preserved and candied cherries.
- Regulatory notes: Safety evaluations exist and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been set by authorities.

## Why is Erythrosine added to food?
Erythrosine is added to supply a bright red color that survives processing and storage. Color helps foods look uniform from batch to batch, makes fruit pieces like preserved cherries look ripe, and can signal flavor in sweets and decorations.

## What foods contain Erythrosine?
Rules differ by region. In the European Union (EU), E127 is authorized only in certain preserved cherries (such as cocktail and candied cherries) under specific conditions set in EU law.[^3] EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has reviewed these uses and maintained an ADI while noting its limited authorization in the EU.[^2]

In the United States, FD&C Red No. 3 is approved for coloring foods generally, subject to good manufacturing practice, and is listed in federal regulations for certified color additives.[^1] Examples include preserved cherries, dessert toppings, confectionery, and other processed foods where a bright red hue is desired.

## What can replace Erythrosine?
Depending on the recipe, manufacturers may switch to:
- [Allura Red AC](/e129-allura-red) (E129), a widely used synthetic red
- [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r) (E124), a synthetic red used outside the U.S.
- [Cochineal](/e120-cochineal) (E120), a natural carmine red
- [Beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) (E162), a natural red from beets
- [Anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) (E163), natural reds/purples from fruits
- [Paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) (E160c), a natural orange-red

The best substitute depends on the target shade, light/heat stability, pH, and whether a natural or vegan source is required.

## How is Erythrosine made?
Erythrosine is a synthetically produced color additive. In U.S. law it is defined as the disodium salt of 2,4,5,7‑tetraiodofluorescein, and must meet identity and purity specifications to be certified before use in foods.[^1] Chemically, it belongs to the xanthene family of dyes, which are known for bright, fluorescent colors.[^5]

## Is Erythrosine safe to eat?
Safety has been evaluated by multiple authorities. EFSA set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for E127, based on thyroid effects seen at high doses in animals.[^2] In the U.S., FD&C Red No. 3 is permitted for use in foods in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice, and each batch must be certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[^1]

Large animal studies by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) found thyroid tumors in male rats at high doses; regulators judged these findings alongside other data and set conservative limits to protect consumers.[^4] Within authorized uses and the ADI, authorities consider exposure from food to be acceptable.[^2]

ADI means acceptable daily intake. EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority. NTP is the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

## Does Erythrosine have any benefits?
Erythrosine provides no nutritional or medical benefit; it is a color only. Its value is technical: it delivers a strong, uniform red shade that helps foods look the same over time and between batches.

## Who should avoid Erythrosine?
People advised by their healthcare provider to limit iodine or who have certain thyroid conditions may prefer to avoid foods high in E127, because the dye contains iodine and thyroid effects were central to toxicology findings at high doses in animals.[^2] Anyone with a diagnosed sensitivity to specific color additives should read labels and choose alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s banned everywhere.” False. It is authorized for general food use in the U.S., and allowed for only a few cherry products in the EU.[^1][^3]
- “Any amount causes cancer.” False. Tumors were seen in rats at high doses; regulators reviewed this evidence and set an ADI to keep human exposure within safe limits.[^2][^4]
- “It isn’t regulated.” False. In the U.S., every batch must pass FDA certification before it can be used in food.[^1]

## Erythrosine in branded foods
You will find E127 on ingredient lists as “erythrosine,” “E127,” or “FD&C Red No. 3.” It is most often seen in preserved red cherries (cocktail or candied), dessert toppings, some confectionery, and decorative bakery items. Availability and use vary by country; always check the label if you are avoiding this color.
