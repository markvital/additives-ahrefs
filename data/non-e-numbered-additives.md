# Non-E-numbered additives

The following records in the dataset do not map to a single authorised EU E-number. They remain in the data directory so their historical search metrics are preserved, but they should be excluded from E-number enrichment until a precise mapping is identified. Sources reference Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 consolidated text (CELEX:32011R1129) unless noted otherwise.

| Title | Rationale | Suggested handling | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amino acids | Regulation 1333/2008 lists individual amino acids such as L-glutamic acid (E 620) through glycine (E 640), but there is no umbrella entry for a generic "Amino acids" additive. | Keep in non-E-numbered list until mapped to a specific authorised amino acid. | [CELEX:32011R1129](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Ammonium and sodium carbonates | The regulation treats ammonium carbonates (E 503) and sodium carbonates (E 500) as distinct additives; the combined concept is a raising agent mixture rather than a standalone E-number. | Keep here or split into separate authorised additives. | [E 500](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129), [E 503](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Carbonat Acid De Sodi I Difosfat De Disodi | Catalan name for a baking powder blend of sodium carbonate (E 500) and disodium diphosphate (E 450). The mixture has no dedicated E-number. | Move to non-E-numbered list; map components to E 500 and E 450 where needed. | [E 500](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129), [E 450](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Di- and triphosphates | The regulation enumerates diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) separately. The combined description covers multiple authorised additives. | Leave in the non-E-numbered list or replace with the specific phosphates. | [E 450](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129), [E 451](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129), [E 452](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| dimethyl sulfone | No listing for dimethyl sulfone or methylsulfonylmethane appears in the EU additive list, indicating it is not an authorised food additive in the register. | Keep outside the enrichment workflow. | [CELEX:32011R1129 search](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Diphosphates and sodium carbonates | Another raising agent blend that combines E 450 diphosphates and E 500 sodium carbonates without a single E-number. | Keep in the non-E-numbered list or replace with explicit components. | [E 450](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129), [E 500](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Inorganic salts | Generic chemical class; multiple authorised additives fall under this category but no single E-number corresponds to "inorganic salts". | Retain as non-E-numbered placeholder. | [CELEX:32011R1129](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Isomaltose | Not listed as an authorised additive; the approved sugar alcohol is isomalt (E 953), a different ingredient derived from isomaltulose/isomaltose. | Keep outside enrichment until a regulatory identifier exists. | [E 953 entry](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Nucleic acids | Regulation lists specific ribonucleotide salts (E 626–E 635) but not a generic "Nucleic acids" additive. | Retain on the non-E-numbered list pending clarification. | [CELEX:32011R1129](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Organic acids | Umbrella label covering multiple authorised acids (e.g., acetic acid E 260, citric acid E 330); no single E-number matches the generic term. | Keep in non-E-numbered list or map to precise acids. | [CELEX:32011R1129](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |
| Potassium iodide | Not listed in the EU additive register; only potassium iodate (E 917) is authorised for certain uses. | Keep out of enrichment until regulations change or a mapping is required. | [CELEX:32011R1129](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32011R1129) |

## Questionable E-number placeholders pending validation

These records currently carry E-numbers as their titles but lack any corroborating evidence of authorised additives in the EU register or reputable compilations of E-codes. They should be reviewed and likely removed to avoid polluting enrichment workflows.

| Placeholder | Rationale | Suggested handling | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E387 | No authorised additive listed for E 387 in consolidated Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 schedules or public E-number directories; likely an artefact from legacy ingestion. | Flag for removal after confirming no regional authorisations exist. | Matches Wikidata item Q13081802 but without label or external sources. |
| E390 | Not present in EU additive schedules or reputable E-number listings; repeated placeholder entries with no supporting metadata. | Flag for removal after confirmation. | Appears only as numeric query term in historical search metrics. |
| E638 | Sequential gap between authorised flavour enhancers E 636, E 637 and E 640; no evidence of an assigned additive labelled E 638. | Flag for removal after confirmation. | No Wikidata identifier; zero search volume observed. |
| E101A | EU legislation enumerates the riboflavin phosphate variant as E 101 (ii); the alphanumeric label "E101A" is absent from official registers. | Merge with the existing E101II entry or remove after review. | Duplicate concept of riboflavin-5′-phosphate already covered in dataset. |
| E105 | Synthetic dye Fast Yellow AB (E105) was delisted due to toxicity concerns and is not permitted under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. | Flag for removal after confirming no legacy references must be retained. | No active authorisation; placeholder kept only for search metrics. |
| E15X | Caramel colours are authorised individually as E 150a–E 150d; there is no consolidated code "E15X" in EU schedules. | Remove or map searches to the specific caramel variants where appropriate. | Likely a catch-all alias created during ingestion. |
| E411 | Neither the EU register nor common E-number directories assign an additive to code E 411. | Flag for removal after verification. | Possibly confused with non-additive uses such as roadway numbering. |
| E543 | The EU additive lists end the phosphate series at E 542; code E 543 has no documented assignment. | Flag for removal after verification. | Associated Wikidata item lacks regulatory sourcing. |
