## Why skincare formulators use it
Retinol accelerates cell turnover and stimulates collagen, making it a go-to active for smoothing wrinkles and improving clarity. It is highly researched, giving brands confidence in performance claims.

## Things to know
Because retinol can be irritating, encapsulation and slow-release delivery systems are popular ways to improve tolerance. Always recommend pairing with sunscreen and buffering with moisturizers during initial use.

## Popular formats
Common formats include night creams, targeted serums, and treatment oils. Many brands offer starter strengths alongside more potent options for experienced retinoid users.
