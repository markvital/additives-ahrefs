Retinol is a gold-standard topical retinoid that converts into active retinoic acid within the skin. It speeds up cell turnover and stimulates collagen for a smoother, more even surface.

## Why it matters
- Softens fine lines, mottled texture, and post-breakout marks with consistent use.
- Encourages collagen synthesis, helping skin look firmer and more elastic over time.
- Available in a range of strengths, making it easy to build tolerance gradually.

## How to use it
- Start with low concentrations (0.1â€“0.3%) two to three nights per week, then increase as tolerated.
- Apply only at night and follow with moisturizer; always wear sunscreen during the day.
- Pair with barrier-supporting ingredients like ceramides or peptides to offset dryness or flaking.
