Hyaluronic acid is a sugar-like molecule naturally found in skin and connective tissue. It binds large amounts of water, keeping the surface hydrated, supple, and comfortably plump.

## Why it matters
- Reinforces the moisture barrier by attracting and holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water.
- Works well alongside ceramides, glycerin, and occlusives to lock in hydration.
- Modern cosmetic grades are produced by biofermentation, resulting in vegan-friendly, high-purity powders.

## How to use it
- Layer watery hyaluronic serums on damp skin, then seal with a moisturizer to prevent evaporation.
- Combine different molecular weights for surface smoothing plus deeper hydration.
- Pair with barrier-supporting lipids (like ceramides or squalane) when using exfoliating or retinoid routines.
