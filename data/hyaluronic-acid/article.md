## Why skincare formulators use it
Hyaluronic acid excels at drawing water into the skin, helping formulas deliver immediate plumping and long-lasting hydration. It layers well with most actives and supports a supple feel across skin types.

## Things to know
Modern hyaluronic acid is usually produced through biofermentation, creating a vegan-friendly ingredient with consistent purity. Molecular weight determines how deeply it can hydrate, so many serums blend different sizes for a balanced effect.

## Popular formats
Look for it in lightweight serums, sheet masks, and gel moisturizers that emphasize hydration or barrier repair. Pairing it with occlusives or ceramides helps lock in the moisture it attracts.
