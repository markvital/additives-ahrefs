Potassium lactate (E326) is the potassium salt of lactic acid. Food makers use it to control acidity, keep foods moist, and help slow the growth of harmful bacteria in products like cooked meats and poultry. It has a mild, slightly salty taste and is widely approved for use in many countries.

## At a glance
- What it is: the potassium salt of [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), a common food acid.
- What it does: helps regulate pH (acidity), retain moisture, and support food safety by inhibiting microbes in some foods.
- Where you’ll see it: especially in ready-to-eat meats and poultry, plus other processed foods.
- Label names: “potassium lactate” or “E326.”
- Dietary note: “lactate” is not “lactose,” so it isn’t a milk sugar.

## Why is potassium lactate added to food?
Potassium lactate helps keep foods safe and stable. It regulates acidity (pH), holds moisture so products stay juicy, and supports control of bacteria that cause spoilage or illness, especially in cooked and ready-to-eat meats. In the European Union (EU), E326 is authorized as a food additive across many categories under general rules for safe use.[^1] In the United States, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lists potassium lactate as a safe and suitable antimicrobial ingredient in meat and poultry processing when used as specified.[^2]

Manufacturers may also choose potassium lactate instead of [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate) to formulate with potassium rather than sodium.

## What foods contain potassium lactate?
You’ll most often find potassium lactate in:
- Cooked and ready-to-eat meats and poultry (for example, sliced ham, turkey, hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats)[^2]
- Brined or marinated products
- Some sauces, prepared meals, and other processed foods where pH control and moisture retention are useful[^1]

Labeling may show “potassium lactate” or “E326,” depending on the market.

## What can replace potassium lactate?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- For pH control: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate)
- For antimicrobial effect in meats: [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate), [sodium diacetate](/e262ii-sodium-diacetate), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) where allowed
- For moisture retention: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol)
- For formulation with calcium or sodium instead of potassium: [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate) or [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate)

## How is potassium lactate made?
Food-grade potassium lactate is produced by neutralizing [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) with [potassium hydroxide](/e525-potassium-hydroxide), then refining the solution to meet purity specifications.[^3] Its chemical formula is C3H5O3K (the potassium salt of lactate).[^5]

## Is potassium lactate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated sodium, potassium, and calcium lactates (E325–E327) and found no safety concern for the general population at reported use levels; an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not considered necessary under current conditions of use.[^4] E326 is authorized in the EU as a food additive under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^1] In the U.S., FSIS permits potassium lactate as a safe and suitable ingredient in meat and poultry when used as specified.[^2]

## Does potassium lactate have any benefits?
- Food safety support: In meat and poultry, potassium lactate is used to inhibit harmful and spoilage bacteria as part of a broader safety strategy.[^2]
- Quality: It helps products retain moisture and maintain a pleasant texture.
- Formulation flexibility: Using the potassium salt allows formulators to reduce sodium contributed by the additive compared with the sodium version.

## Who should avoid potassium lactate?
- People who must limit potassium: Individuals with kidney disease or on certain medicines may need to restrict dietary potassium; they should follow healthcare advice and check labels for potassium salts, including potassium lactate.[^6]
- Very young infants: Safety assessments note that infants have limited capacity to handle D-lactate; product standards for infant foods set specific requirements. Caregivers should follow age-appropriate product guidance.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- “Lactate contains lactose.” False. Lactate is a salt of lactic acid; lactose is a milk sugar. Potassium lactate does not contain lactose.
- “It’s made from milk.” Usually false. While “lactic” sounds like milk, food-grade lactic acid used to make potassium lactate is produced industrially and then neutralized; the end product doesn’t require milk.
- “It adds lots of potassium.” Only a small amount is used in most foods. It does contribute potassium, but it’s not typically a major source in the diet.

## potassium lactate in branded foods
Look for “potassium lactate” or “E326” in ingredient lists on:
- Sliced deli meats, hot dogs, and cooked sausages
- Marinated or injected meat and poultry products
- Some prepared meals and sauces

In these foods, it helps with pH control, moisture retention, and microbial stability. If you’re managing potassium intake, compare labels across brands and serving sizes.
