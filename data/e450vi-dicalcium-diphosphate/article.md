Dicalcium diphosphate (E450VI) is a calcium salt of pyrophosphate used to control texture, moisture, and rise in many foods. It helps baked goods lift, keeps mixtures stable, and can bind metal ions that might cause off-colors or flavors. It is approved in the EU and considered safe for most people when used as intended.

## At a glance
- What it is: The calcium salt of pyrophosphate; also called dicalcium pyrophosphate.
- What it does: Works as a stabiliser, emulsifier, leavening acid, sequestrant (metal binder), and thickener.
- Where it’s found: Baking powders and mixes, self-raising flour, tortillas, processed meats and seafoods, dairy powders, and some instant drinks.
- Label names: Dicalcium diphosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, E450vi.
- Not the same as: Dicalcium phosphate (E341) — a different additive.
- Dietary notes: Mineral- and animal-free; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Why is Dicalcium diphosphate added to food?
Food makers use dicalcium diphosphate to make batters and doughs rise in a controlled way, especially when paired with baking soda like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate). It also stabilises emulsions, helps hold water in processed foods, and binds metal ions (sequestration) that can cause discoloration or off-flavors. These functions are recognised for the phosphate group that includes E450 additives.[^1]

## What foods contain Dicalcium diphosphate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Baking powders, cake and pancake mixes, self-raising flour
- Flatbreads and tortillas
- Processed meats and canned fish
- Dairy-based powders and desserts
- Instant beverages and powdered soups

In the EU, its use (and the uses of related diphosphates) is authorised across defined food categories under the general food additives regulation. Always check the ingredient list for “dicalcium diphosphate,” “calcium pyrophosphate,” or “E450vi.”[^2]

## What can replace Dicalcium diphosphate?
Depending on the job you need done, common substitutes include:
- For leavening: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [monopotassium tartrate](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate, “cream of tartar”), [glucono‑delta‑lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), or organic acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- Within the phosphate family: [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate), [tetrasodium diphosphate](/e450iii-tetrasodium-diphosphate), [tetrapotassium diphosphate](/e450v-tetrapotassium-diphosphate), or [dimagnesium diphosphate](/e450viii-dimagnesium-diphosphate).
- For buffering or sequestration: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid), [disodium phosphate](/e339ii-disodium-phosphate), [monosodium phosphate](/e339i-monosodium-phosphate), or [trisodium phosphate](/e339iii-trisodium-phosphate).

The “best” swap depends on pH, flavor impact, and when you want the leavening to activate.

## How is Dicalcium diphosphate made?
In food-additive production, pyrophosphate salts are typically prepared from food‑grade phosphoric acid and appropriate mineral sources, followed by controlled dehydration to form the pyrophosphate structure. The EU additive specification lists identity and purity criteria for diphosphates, including E450VI (dicalcium diphosphate).[^3]

## Is Dicalcium diphosphate safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended. In 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated phosphoric acid, phosphates, diphosphates, and polyphosphates (E 338–341, E 343, E 450–452) and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg phosphorus per kg body weight per day from all phosphate additives combined.[^1] The EU regulates where and how much can be added to foods.[^2]

For most people, typical diets stay within the ADI. As with any phosphate additive, total intake can add up across many processed foods, so variety and moderation are sensible.

## Does Dicalcium diphosphate have any benefits?
Its benefits are technological: it helps baked goods rise, stabilises texture, and keeps products consistent. While it contains calcium and phosphorus, phosphate additives are highly absorbable and mainly contribute to phosphorus intake rather than serving as meaningful calcium supplements.[^4]

## Who should avoid Dicalcium diphosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those told to follow a low‑phosphorus diet should limit phosphate additives, including dicalcium diphosphate, because these forms are readily absorbed and can raise blood phosphorus levels.[^4]
- Young children who eat many phosphate‑rich processed foods may approach or exceed the group ADI; choosing more fresh, minimally processed foods can help manage overall phosphate intake.[^1]

If you have kidney, bone‑mineral, or cardiovascular concerns, ask your healthcare professional or dietitian about phosphate additives in your diet.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s the same as dicalcium phosphate. Fact: Dicalcium diphosphate (E450VI) is a pyrophosphate; dicalcium phosphate belongs to the orthophosphates (E341).
- Myth: It’s only a preservative. Fact: Its main roles are leavening, stabilising, thickening, and metal‑ion binding; it is not primarily used to stop microbial growth.
- Myth: More is better for calcium. Fact: It isn’t intended as a calcium supplement; it’s used for how food cooks and holds together.

## Dicalcium diphosphate in branded foods
Look for it on ingredient lists as “dicalcium diphosphate,” “calcium pyrophosphate,” or “E450vi.” You’ll most often find it in baking mixes, self‑raising flour, tortillas, processed meats or seafoods, and some dairy powders. Related phosphate additives may also appear, such as [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate) or other [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates).
