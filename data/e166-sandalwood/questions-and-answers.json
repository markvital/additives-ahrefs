      "q": "what does sandalwood smell like",

      "q": "is sandalwood safe for cats",
      "a": "Sandalwood essential oil isn’t considered safe for cats—avoid diffusing or applying it, as cats are highly sensitive to essential oil compounds. The E166 sandalwood colorant isn’t authorized for food use in the EU and isn’t intended for pet foods; safety data in cats are lacking.",

      "q": "is sandalwood oil safe for dogs",
      "a": "Sandalwood oil can be irritating or toxic to dogs if ingested or used undiluted; only consider very dilute, vet-guided topical use and never allow ingestion or unavoidable diffuser exposure. Stop use and seek veterinary care if vomiting, lethargy, or breathing changes occur.",

      "q": "where does sandalwood come from",
      "a": "E166 is derived from the heartwood of red sandalwood (Pterocarpus santalinus), traditionally sourced from India and Southeast Asia, and used as a natural red colorant. The fragrant essential oil called sandalwood instead comes from Santalum species (e.g., Santalum album, S. spicatum).",
