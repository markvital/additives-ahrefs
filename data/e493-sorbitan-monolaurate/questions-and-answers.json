      "a": "Sorbitan monolaurate (E493) is a non-ionic emulsifier made from sorbitol and lauric acid; it is not the same as polysorbate 80, which is the ethoxylated derivative E433. E493 helps oils disperse in water-based foods like baked goods and desserts.",

      "q": "what is polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate",
      "a": "Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate refers to the ethoxylated form better known as polysorbate 20 or 80, whereas E493 is the unethoxylated sorbitan monolaurate. Both are permitted emulsifiers, but E493 has a lower HLB value suited to water-in-oil systems.",
