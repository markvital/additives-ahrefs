Disodium tartrate (E335ii) is the sodium salt of L(+)-tartaric acid, used to control acidity and to bind trace metals that can spoil flavor and color. It appears on labels as disodium tartrate, E335ii, or sometimes under the broader term sodium tartrates (E335). It is authorized for use in the European Union when it meets strict identity and purity rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: the disodium salt of L(+)-tartaric acid; a white, water‑soluble powder or crystals.
- What it does: controls acidity (acts as a buffer), binds metal ions (sequestrant), and helps stabilize color and flavor.
- Where it’s used: a wide range of processed foods and drinks in the EU, applied at levels needed for the effect.
- Label names: “disodium tartrate,” “E335ii,” or the broader group “sodium tartrates (E335).”
- Related additives: [L‑tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), [potassium tartrates](/e336-potassium-tartrates), and [sodium tartrates](/e335-sodium-tartrates).
- How it’s made: by neutralizing L(+)-tartaric acid with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate.
- Safety: authorized in the EU with detailed specifications; people limiting sodium should count it toward daily sodium intake.

## Why is Disodium tartrate added to food?
Food makers use disodium tartrate to keep acidity steady and to bind trace metals like iron and copper that can drive off‑flavors, color changes, and haze. These actions help protect taste, color, and clarity over shelf life. In the European Union, it is an authorized food additive under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, which sets general rules for how additives may be used. [^2]

## What foods contain Disodium tartrate?
You may see disodium tartrate on ingredient lists for flavored drinks, confections, fruit preparations, jams and jellies, and other processed foods where stable acidity and color are important. In the EU, the exact permissions and maximum levels depend on the product category listed in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, and many uses operate under “quantum satis,” meaning only the amount needed for the intended effect may be added. [^2]

## What can replace Disodium tartrate?
Depending on the job in the recipe, makers might choose:
- For acidity control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid).
- For buffering capacity: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) and [potassium phosphates](/e340-potassium-phosphates).
- For metal ion control: citrates or phosphates can also act as sequestrants in some systems.

Each alternative has its own taste impact, solubility, and regulatory limits, so substitutions are made case by case.

## How is Disodium tartrate made?
Commercially, disodium tartrate is produced by neutralizing purified L(+)-tartaric acid with a sodium base such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, followed by crystallization and drying. EU specifications require the L(+)-isomer and set identity, purity, and contaminant limits for E335(ii). [^1]

## Is Disodium tartrate safe to eat?
Within the European Union, disodium tartrate is permitted as a food additive and must meet detailed identity and purity specifications laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012. When used according to EU rules and good manufacturing practice, it is considered acceptable for use in foods. [^1] The general conditions for the use of additives, including labeling and permitted categories, are defined in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. [^2]

## Does Disodium tartrate have any benefits?
Yes. By keeping acidity stable, it can help maintain consistent flavor and texture. Its ability to bind trace metals also helps protect color and reduce the development of off‑flavors during processing and storage.

## Who should avoid Disodium tartrate?
- People on sodium‑restricted diets: Disodium tartrate contributes a small amount of sodium. While typical use levels are low, it still counts toward daily sodium intake. If you are limiting sodium for blood pressure or heart health, check labels and discuss your overall diet with a healthcare professional. [^3]
- Individuals with specific medical advice to avoid tartrate salts should follow their clinician’s guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s a leavening acid used in baking powder.” Fact: Disodium tartrate is a fully neutral salt; it stabilizes and sequesters rather than releasing gas with baking soda. Potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar, a different tartrate) is the classic leavening acid.
- Myth: “All tartrates are identical.” Fact: Sodium and potassium tartrates differ in sodium content, taste impact, and how they behave in recipes.
- Myth: “If it’s E‑numbered, it’s unsafe.” Fact: E‑numbers in the EU mean the additive has been assessed and authorized with specifications and conditions of use. [^2]

## Disodium tartrate in branded foods
On EU labels, look for “disodium tartrate,” “E335ii,” or sometimes “E335.” It most often appears in products that need tight acid control and color stability, such as flavored beverages, fruit‑based fillings, confections, and some spreads. Availability and use vary by brand and product style; always check the ingredient list.
