- Also called/E-number: Gold, E175, Pigment Metal 3, element 79
- What it does: Adds surface decoration and metallic color; no flavor or nutrition
- Common in: Edible gold leaf or dust on pastries, chocolates, fancy desserts, and some spirits
- Diet flags: Vegan and vegetarian friendly when pure; gluten-free; check for kosher/halal certification if needed

1) Why it’s added to food
- Gold is used for decoration. It gives a shiny, metallic finish to the surface of foods and beverages.
- It does not change taste or texture when used correctly.

Shopping tips:
- Look for labels that say “edible gold,” “E175,” or “gold leaf/flakes (food grade).”
- Avoid craft or cake-decor gold not labeled as edible.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Bakery: Gold leaf or dust on cakes, macarons, and pastries.
- Confectionery: Truffles, chocolate bars, and pralines with gold accents.
- Beverages: Some liqueurs and cocktails with gold flakes; occasional use on sushi or plated dishes.

Shopping tips:
- Check ingredient lists for “gold,” “E175,” or “gold leaf/flakes.” 
- For drinks, check the brand site or label notes for gold flakes.

3) What are its alternatives
- Colored sanding sugars or sprinkles.
- Mica-based pearlescent pigments labeled as edible.
- Cocoa butter-based luster sprays made for food.
- Silver decorations (E174) are common in the EU, but in the U.S. only use if clearly labeled edible.

Shopping tips:
- Choose decorations with a clear “edible” label and full ingredient list.
- Avoid “non-toxic” craft glitters; that term does not mean edible.

4) How Gold is manufactured
- Food-grade gold leaf starts with high-purity gold, typically 22–24 karat to reduce other metals.
- The gold is rolled and hammered into very thin sheets, then cut into leaf, flakes, or milled into powder.
- Food-grade specifications limit impurities like silver, copper, and other metals.

5) How safe is Gold for consumption?
- In the EU, EFSA has evaluated E175 for decorative, surface-only use and set purity limits to control impurities. Typical use levels are very low and gold is largely inert and not absorbed.

Shopping tips:
- Choose products that state “edible gold,” list gold (E175) as an ingredient, and specify purity (for example, 23–24K).
- Avoid items with unclear origin or no ingredient list.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Edible metallic gold is not known to provide nutrients or health benefits.
- Some prescription gold compounds have medical uses (for example, certain arthritis drugs), but these are not the same as edible gold leaf or flakes and are not food ingredients.

7) When Gold may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Do not consume craft gold leaf or glitter; it may contain non-food metals or coatings.
- People with known gold allergy or contact dermatitis should avoid edible gold.
- Avoid “colloidal gold” supplements; they are not approved as nutrients, and safety/benefit claims are unproven.
