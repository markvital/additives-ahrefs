Citrus Red 2 (E121) is a synthetic orange-red color used in the United States to dye the outer peel of some oranges. It is tightly regulated and may be applied only to the skin, not to the edible flesh or juice.

## At a glance
This additive is used only to improve how orange peels look on some fresh oranges sold in stores.  
- What it is: A synthetic “azo” dye (a dye containing an –N=N– azo bond).  
- Where it’s used: On the skins of mature oranges; not a general-purpose food color.  
- What it does: Evens out peel color when fruit ripens with green patches.  
- Taste/texture: No effect on flavor or juiciness.  
- Oversight: In the U.S., its use is limited to orange peels and subject to FDA color certification rules.[^1]

## Why is Citrus Red 2 added to food?
It’s added to the peel (skin) of some mature oranges to give a uniform orange color when the rind would otherwise appear pale or uneven. U.S. regulations permit Citrus Red 2 only for coloring the skins of oranges, and not for general use in food.[^1]

## What foods contain Citrus Red 2?
You may encounter Citrus Red 2 on some fresh-market oranges in the U.S., and only on the peel. It is not allowed on oranges intended for processing (like juicing or canning), and it is not approved for use in foods in general.[^1] Shipping containers for such oranges must be marked “colored with Citrus Red No. 2.”[^1] Because the dye is for peel color only, you typically will not see it listed on ingredient labels for packaged foods.[^2]

## What can replace Citrus Red 2?
For whole fruit, the most straightforward “replacement” is simply selling oranges without added color. For coloring processed foods (not orange peels), food makers often use permitted alternatives such as:
- [beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene) for orange/yellow shades  
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto) for warm orange hues  
- [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for red-orange tones  
- [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red) or [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) in specific applications

These alternatives are used in foods, not on orange peels, which have their own specific rules.

## How is Citrus Red 2 made?
Citrus Red 2 is a synthetic azo dye, produced by standard dye chemistry that forms an azo bond (–N=N–) between aromatic rings. It is an industrially manufactured compound, not extracted from fruit. In the U.S., each batch of color additive used in regulated applications is subject to FDA color certification to verify compliance with identity and purity specifications.[^4][^5]

## Is Citrus Red 2 safe to eat?
Under U.S. law, Citrus Red 2 is considered safe for its very limited use on orange peels, with conditions that keep it off the edible portions and out of processed foods.[^1] Consumers typically peel oranges before eating, and general produce guidance recommends washing fruit under running water before peeling to remove surface residues and dirt.[^3]

## Does Citrus Red 2 have any benefits?
Its benefit is cosmetic: it makes the peel look more uniformly orange and market-ready. It does not add nutrition, extend shelf life, or change taste.

## Who should avoid Citrus Red 2?
- People who plan to use orange peel (zest, candied peel, marmalades) and prefer to avoid synthetic colors may wish to choose uncolored fruit.  
- Shoppers who prefer minimally treated produce can look for store signage on shipping boxes or ask the retailer whether the oranges were “colored with Citrus Red No. 2.”[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It colors the flesh and the juice.  
  Fact: Its legal use is limited to the peel, and it’s not allowed on oranges intended for processing into juice.[^1]
- Myth: If it’s used, it must appear on the orange’s price sticker.  
  Fact: The requirement is for the shipping container to be marked “colored with Citrus Red No. 2.” Retail displays may reflect that information.[^1]
- Myth: Washing oranges doesn’t matter.  
  Fact: Washing produce under running water helps remove surface residues before peeling or cutting.[^3]

## Citrus Red 2 in branded foods
You generally won’t find Citrus Red 2 in packaged, branded foods. Its permitted use is specific to the peels of whole oranges sold fresh, and it is not a general food ingredient.[^1][^2]
