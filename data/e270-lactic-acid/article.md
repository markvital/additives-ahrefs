Lactic acid (E270) is a sour-tasting organic acid used to control acidity, add tangy flavor, and help keep foods stable. It occurs naturally in fermented foods and is also made at industrial scale, mainly by fermenting plant sugars. It appears on labels as lactic acid or E270.

## At a glance
- Role: acidity regulator, flavoring agent, and antimicrobial aid
- Where found: wide range of processed foods and drinks, plus fermented foods
- How made: mostly by fermentation of sugars with lactic acid bacteria
- Regulation: permitted in the U.S. as a food ingredient and labeled E270 in the EU
- Typical form: clear, syrupy liquid; available as L-, D-, or DL- (mixed) forms

## Why is Lactic acid added to food?
Food makers add lactic acid to adjust pH, sharpen flavor, and support freshness. In U.S. regulation, it is affirmed as “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) for use as a pH control agent and flavoring at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, lactic acid is listed as E270 with defined purity criteria for use as a food additive.[^3]

It also helps with food safety in certain processing steps. For example, it is an approved processing aid for carcass surface treatments in meat and poultry plants under U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidance.[^4]

## What foods contain Lactic acid?
You can find lactic acid across many everyday products:
- Beverages and drink mixes (to brighten flavor and balance sweetness)
- Confectionery and desserts (to give a gentle tart note)
- Dressings, sauces, and condiments (for tang and pH control)
- Baked goods and tortillas (to control dough acidity and taste)
- Fermented foods like sauerkraut or sourdough, where it also forms naturally

In meat and poultry processing, lactic acid may be applied to carcass surfaces as an antimicrobial processing aid; when used this way it is not always present in the final product in significant amounts.[^4]

## What can replace Lactic acid?
Depending on the recipe and desired taste, common alternatives include:
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for a bright, lemony tartness
- [Acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) for vinegar-like sharpness
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for a smoother, apple-like sourness
- [L-(+)-Tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) for strong, grape-like sourness

For preservation roles, other options may include [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), depending on the food and pH. Always consider taste, pH, and labeling rules when swapping acids.

## How is Lactic acid made?
Commercial lactic acid is produced mainly by fermenting carbohydrates (such as sugar or starch) using lactic acid–producing bacteria. U.S. regulations describe it as the product of carbohydrate fermentation by lactic acid bacteria and allow it as a GRAS ingredient when made under good manufacturing practice.[^1] The EU additive specification (E270) sets identity and purity criteria for food-grade lactic acid.[^3]

Chemically, lactic acid exists in two mirror-image forms: L-(+)-lactic acid and D-(-)-lactic acid; many food-grade products are the DL mixture. The L-form is the one most commonly produced by typical food microbes and human metabolism.[^5]

## Is Lactic acid safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the United States, lactic acid is affirmed GRAS for use as a flavoring and pH control agent at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, lactic acid (E270) has been re-evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels in foods.[^2]

Lactic acid solutions are acidic and concentrated forms can be corrosive, but the amounts used in foods are small and controlled by manufacturers to achieve the intended taste and pH.[^2]

## Does Lactic acid have any benefits?
- Taste and texture: It gives a clean, tangy flavor and can subtly tighten textures in some foods.
- pH control: Lowering pH helps stabilize color, flavor, and consistency during shelf life.[^1]
- Processing aid: In meat and poultry plants, lactic acid solutions can reduce surface bacteria when used as directed, supporting food safety systems.[^4]

## Who should avoid Lactic acid?
Most people can consume foods containing lactic acid without issue. However:
- People with short bowel syndrome or a history of D-lactic acidosis should follow medical advice on dietary D-lactate exposure because they may be sensitive to D-lactic acid produced in the gut.[^6]
- Individuals on medically prescribed low-acid diets should consider overall dietary acid load with a clinician.

Note: Despite the name, “lactic” acid in foods is usually made by fermenting plant sugars and does not inherently contain milk proteins or lactose.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Lactic acid always comes from milk.  
  Fact: Food-grade lactic acid is typically made by fermenting plant carbohydrates with lactic acid bacteria.[^1]
- Myth: Lactic acid is only a preservative.  
  Fact: Regulations recognize it primarily as a pH control agent and flavoring; any antimicrobial effect depends on context and pH.[^1]
- Myth: It’s unsafe because it’s an “acid.”  
  Fact: Safety reviews in both the U.S. and EU support its use at normal food levels; acidity is carefully controlled by manufacturers.[^2]

## Lactic acid in branded foods
You’ll often see “lactic acid” or “E270” on ingredient lists for soft drinks, candies, sauces, sliced breads and tortillas, pickled items, and some plant-based fermented foods. It may also appear alongside lactate salts such as [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate) or [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate) in certain formulas. If you’re tracking acids or sensitive to tart flavors, check the ingredients panel near the end of the list where acidulants are commonly placed.
