      "q": "does milk help acid reflux",
      "a": "Milk can briefly buffer stomach acid, but its fat and protein may stimulate acid production later, so effects vary by person; fermented dairy contains lactic acid (E270), whose acidity helps tartness and may help or bother individuals depending on sensitivity.",

      "q": "how to drain lactic acid from legs",
      "a": "You don’t need to “drain” it—exercise-produced lactate (the same molecule as food additive E270 in ion form) is naturally cleared or reused for energy within about an hour. Muscle soreness after workouts is from microdamage, not trapped lactic acid; light movement and time help.",

      "q": "what does lactic acid do",
      "a": "In foods, E270 is an acidity regulator and flavoring that lowers pH to add a tangy taste and stabilize products. It also inhibits spoilage microbes and is used to reduce pathogens on meats and in fermented foods, beverages, and pickles.",

      "q": "what does lactic acid do for skin",
      "a": "As an alpha‑hydroxy acid, lactic acid gently exfoliates and increases skin hydration, helping smooth texture and brighten dullness. At higher strengths or low pH it can irritate sensitive skin.",

    {
      "q": "how to get rid of lactic acid",
      "a": "Your body naturally clears exercise-produced lactate quickly, so there’s no need to “flush” it. Staying hydrated and doing light activity can support normal clearance; lactic acid in foods (E270) doesn’t cause muscle lactate buildup.",
