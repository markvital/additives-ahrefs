# E221 — Sodium sulfite

## Summary (3 sentences)
Sodium sulfite (E221) is a preservative and antioxidant that helps prevent browning and spoilage in certain foods and drinks.
Upsides: it protects color and flavor and can extend shelf life.
Risks: a subset of people—especially some with asthma—are sensitive to sulfites and should avoid them.

## 1) Why it’s added to food
Sodium sulfite slows oxidation and browning and helps keep flavor and color stable during storage and transport.
In wine, sulfites also help control unwanted microbes.

## 2) What foods it’s found in
Most often in wines, some dried fruits (e.g., apricots), certain potato items, and a few specialty products.
In the U.S., wine labels must say “Contains sulfites” at ≥10 ppm.

## 3) What are its alternatives
- Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, E300) or citric acid (E330) for anti-browning in some foods
- Packaging/oxygen control (modified atmosphere, oxygen scavengers)
- Other preservatives where allowed, e.g., potassium sorbate (E202)

## 4) How is sodium sulfite manufactured?
Industry absorbs sulfur dioxide into a sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution, then crystallizes and dries the sodium sulfite.

## 5) How safe is sodium sulfite for consumption?
- EFSA/JECFA: group ADI 0–0.7 mg/kg body weight (as SO₂ equivalents) for sulfites, with ongoing monitoring of exposure.
- U.S. labeling: wine must declare “Contains sulfites” at ≥10 ppm; sulfiting agents are not allowed on raw fruits/vegetables served fresh to the public.

## 6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have?
Sodium sulfite is not used as a human therapy; its role is preservation, not treatment.

## 7) When sodium sulfite may be unsafe (contraindications)
People with sulfite sensitivity (more common in some with asthma) can react at low levels (e.g., wheezing, hives).
Those individuals should avoid sulfite-containing products and discuss options with their clinician.

## Myths & facts
- **Myth:** “Sulfites cause most red-wine headaches.”  
  **Fact:** Headaches are more often linked to alcohol, histamine, or tannins; sulfite sensitivity usually causes respiratory symptoms, not headaches.
- **Myth:** “Sulfites equal sulfa drug allergy.”  
  **Fact:** Different chemistry. A sulfonamide (sulfa) antibiotic allergy does not mean a sulfite sensitivity.
- **Myth:** “Organic wine has zero sulfites.”  
  **Fact:** Fermentation naturally makes some sulfites; “organic” rules restrict added sulfites, not the natural trace amounts.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions (Google-style)
1. **What foods have sulfites?**  
   Wines/ciders, some dried fruits, and some potato items (check labels).
2. **Do sulfites cause headaches?**  
   Not typically; sensitivity is more often respiratory.
3. **Are sulfites safe during pregnancy?**  
   Most people tolerate label-level sulfites, but if you’re sensitive—or unsure—avoid and discuss with your clinician.
4. **Are sulfites the same as sulfa drug allergies?**  
   No—different chemicals and different reactions.
5. **How can I avoid sulfites?**  
   Choose products labeled “no added sulfites,” look for fresh/unsulfited dried fruit, and check wine labels.
