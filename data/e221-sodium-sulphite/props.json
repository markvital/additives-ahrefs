  "description": "Sodium sulfite (E221) is a preservative and antioxidant that helps prevent browning and spoilage in certain foods and drinks. Upsides: it protects color and flavor and can extend shelf life. Risks: a subset of people—especially some with asthma—are sensitive to sulfites and should avoid them.",
