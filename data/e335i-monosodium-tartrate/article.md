Monosodium tartrate (E335i) is a sodium salt of tartaric acid. It acts mainly as a sequestrant and stabiliser, helping foods keep their color, clarity, and taste during shelf life. It belongs to the same family as potassium and calcium tartrates found naturally in grapes and wine.

## At a glance
This section gives the quick facts before we dig deeper.

- What it is: the mono-sodium salt of [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid)
- What it does: sequestrant and stabiliser that binds trace metals and helps control acidity
- Common in: drinks, sweets, fruit-based foods, and other processed items where clarity and color matter
- Also known as: E335i, monosodium tartrate
- Related additives: [potassium tartrates](/e336-potassium-tartrates), [calcium tartrate](/e354-calcium-tartrate)

## Why is Monosodium tartrate added to food?
Food makers use monosodium tartrate to bind (or “sequester”) metal ions like iron and copper that can cause off-flavors, color changes, and haze. It also helps stabilise acidity, which can improve texture and shelf life in many foods and drinks.[^1]

## What foods contain Monosodium tartrate?
You may find E335i in flavored drinks, fruit preparations (like jams or fillings), confectionery, and some baked or dairy-style products. In the EU, sodium tartrates (E335) are authorized across a range of food categories listed in Annex II of the food additives regulation, with use levels depending on the product type.[^3]

## What can replace Monosodium tartrate?
Depending on the job it does in a recipe, formulators might use:
- For acidity or buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- For sequestration/metal control: [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates) or [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate)
- For antioxidant support: [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate)
- In some beverages: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid) to adjust acidity

The best substitute depends on the food, desired taste, label goals, and local rules.

## How is Monosodium tartrate made?
Monosodium tartrate is formed by partially neutralizing [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) with a sodium base (such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide) to make the mono-sodium salt, followed by purification and crystallization. In the EU, its identity and purity are set by the additive specifications regulation for E-numbered substances.[^2]

## Is Monosodium tartrate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed tartaric acid and its salts, including sodium tartrates (E335). EFSA concluded there is no safety concern for the L(+) forms at the reported uses and use levels in food, and only the L(+) stereochemistry is authorised for food use.[^1]

## Does Monosodium tartrate have any benefits?
There are no direct nutrition benefits. Its value is technological: it helps keep flavors fresh, colors bright, and drinks clear by tying up metal ions that can trigger oxidation or cloudiness. This can also help maintain the intended acidity and texture.

## Who should avoid Monosodium tartrate?
- People on strict sodium-restricted diets may wish to watch total sodium from all sources, including additives.
- Anyone who notices sensitivity (such as digestive upset) to tartaric acid salts should consult a healthcare professional.
- As with any additive, follow specific dietary advice given by your healthcare team.

## Myths & facts
A few quick clarifications help separate rumor from reality.
- Myth: “E-numbers are always artificial and unsafe.” Fact: E-numbers are simply codes for approved additives. Monosodium tartrate is a salt of tartaric acid, which occurs naturally in grapes and wine.[^4]
- Myth: “Monosodium tartrate is the same as cream of tartar.” Fact: Cream of tartar is potassium bitartrate, not the sodium salt.
- Myth: “It adds a sour taste like lemon.” Fact: It can influence acidity, but it is mainly used to bind metals and stabilise products; taste impact is usually minor at typical levels.

## Monosodium tartrate in branded foods
On labels, look for “sodium tartrates,” “monosodium tartrate,” or “E335”/“E335i.” You’re most likely to see it in beverages, sweets, fruit-based products, and other items where clarity and color stability matter.
