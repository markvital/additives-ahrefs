Indanthrene blue RS (E130) is a synthetic blue pigment also known as indanthrone blue. It is mainly used as an industrial dye and pigment, and it is not approved as a food color in the United States or the European Union. In normal retail foods in these markets, you should not see E130 on ingredient lists.

## At a glance
- E-number: E130
- Also called: Indanthrone blue, Indanthrene blue RS
- What it does: Blue colorant (industrial pigment)
- Food status: Not authorized for food use in the U.S. or EU
- Typical use today: Textiles, plastics, coatings (non-food)

## Why is Indanthrene blue RS added to food?
It generally isn’t. In the U.S., color additives must be specifically listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used in food.[^2] E130 is not listed among color additives permitted for use in foods in the FDA’s current resources.[^1] In the EU, only additives on the Union list in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 may be used; E130 does not appear there.[^3]

## What foods contain Indanthrene blue RS?
None in markets that follow U.S. or EU rules. Because E130 is not on FDA’s permitted food color lists and is not on the EU Union list, it should not be used in foods sold in those regions.[^1][^3]

## What can replace Indanthrene blue RS?
If a blue shade is needed in foods, manufacturers use authorized colors instead. Common options include:
- [indigotine (E132)](/e132-indigotine)
- [brilliant blue FCF (E133)](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf)
- [patent blue V (E131)](/e131-patent-blue-v)

The choice depends on the food type, desired hue, and local regulations.

## How is Indanthrene blue RS made?
Indanthrene blue RS is a synthetic organic pigment from the anthraquinone family, known in industry as indanthrone (Pigment Blue 60). It is manufactured for non-food uses such as inks, plastics, and coatings.[^5]

## Is Indanthrene blue RS safe to eat?
Safety for use as a food color has not been established through the approval pathways used in the U.S. or EU. In the U.S., a color additive must be listed by FDA before use in food; unlisted colors are not allowed.[^2] In the EU, only substances on the Union list may be used in food under specified conditions; E130 is not on that list.[^3]

## Does Indanthrene blue RS have any benefits?
As a food additive, none—because it isn’t authorized for use. As an industrial pigment, it is valued for a deep, strong blue shade and durability, but those are non-food applications.[^5]

## Who should avoid Indanthrene blue RS?
Everyone in the U.S. and EU markets should avoid it in foods, simply because it is not permitted there. If you see it on an ingredient label, it may be a labeling error or a product not intended for those markets.[^1][^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Every E-number is approved everywhere.  
  Fact: No. An E-number is a European classification, and only substances on the EU Union list are authorized. E130 is not on that list.[^3]
- Myth: If a blue dye is safe for textiles, it is safe for food.  
  Fact: Not necessarily. Food colors must pass separate assessments and be explicitly authorized before use.[^2]
- Myth: E130 is the same as [indigotine](/e132-indigotine).  
  Fact: They are different substances; indigotine (E132) is an approved food color in many places, while E130 is not.[^1]

## Indanthrene blue RS in branded foods
Major U.S. and EU food brands do not list E130 because it is not authorized for food use in those markets. If you want to verify that a blue color on a label is permitted, you can compare the name to FDA’s list of color additives for foods or consult the EU Union list.[^4][^3]
