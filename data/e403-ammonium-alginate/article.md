Ammonium alginate (E403) is a plant-based thickener and stabiliser made from brown seaweed. It helps foods and drinks feel smooth, hold together, and stay mixed without separating. You’ll find it in items like dairy desserts, sauces, and drinks with pulp or foam.

## At a glance
- What it is: The ammonium salt of alginic acid, a natural gum from brown seaweed.
- What it does: Thickens, stabilises, and helps emulsify foods; can gel in the presence of calcium.
- Common in: Drinks, desserts, sauces, bakery fillings, and some plant-based or reduced-fat products.
- Also known as: E403.
- Dietary notes: Seaweed-derived and typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Why is Ammonium alginate added to food?
Food makers use ammonium alginate to control thickness, keep ingredients from separating, and improve texture and mouthfeel. It also works well in systems that contain calcium (like dairy), where it can form soft gels that help suspended pieces, foams, or pulps stay evenly distributed.[^1]

## What foods contain Ammonium alginate?
You may see E403 in:
- Fruit drinks and juices with pulp
- Chocolate milk, milkshakes, and dairy or plant-based desserts
- Sauces, dressings, and dips
- Pie fillings, glazes, and bakery creams
- Frozen treats and ice creams to improve body and reduce ice crystals
- Reformed or shaped foods where a gentle gel helps hold form

Look for “ammonium alginate” or “E403” on the ingredient list.

## What can replace Ammonium alginate?
Depending on the recipe and processing needs, common substitutes include:
- Other alginates: [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate), [potassium alginate](/e402-potassium-alginate), [calcium alginate](/e404-calcium-alginate), or [alginic acid](/e400-alginic-acid)
- Other gums and hydrocolloids: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [agar](/e406-agar), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum)
- Pectin systems: [pectins](/e440-pectins)

Each option behaves a bit differently, so swaps usually need small adjustments.

## How is Ammonium alginate made?
Manufacturers extract alginic acid from brown seaweed, purify it, and then neutralise it with ammonium to form ammonium alginate. It is defined in the European Union as the ammonium salt of alginic acid obtained from brown algae, with specific purity and quality criteria set for food use.[^2]

## Is Ammonium alginate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated alginic acid and alginate salts (E400–E404) and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels in foods.[^1] The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assigned alginic acid and its ammonium, calcium, potassium, and sodium salts an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) “not specified,” indicating low toxicity at levels needed for food technology.[^3] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists ammonium alginate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^4]

## Does Ammonium alginate have any benefits?
Technologically, it helps create a smooth, stable texture and reduces separation in foods and drinks. In the body, alginates are not digested or absorbed to a significant extent and are largely excreted, acting much like dietary fiber.[^3]

## Who should avoid Ammonium alginate?
Most people can consume E403 without issues. Very high intakes of alginates may loosen stools in some individuals, so those with sensitive digestion may prefer moderate portions. If an infant product contains alginates, follow healthcare advice before use, especially for very young infants or those on special diets.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s a synthetic plastic.” Fact: Ammonium alginate comes from brown seaweed.
- Myth: “It turns food into a hard gel in your stomach.” Fact: It thickens foods but is not absorbed and does not set into a solid mass in the body.
- Myth: “It’s the same as MSG.” Fact: It is unrelated to glutamates; it’s a seaweed gum used for texture.

## Ammonium alginate in branded foods
Labels may list “ammonium alginate” or “E403.” In the EU, the E-number may appear alone; in the U.S., the full name is typically used. To spot it, check the ingredient list on drinks with pulp, dairy or plant-based desserts, sauces, and bakery fillings.
