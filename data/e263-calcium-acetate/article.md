Calcium acetate (E263) is a calcium salt of acetic acid used in foods to control acidity, help preserve freshness, and support texture. It is commonly found in bakery items and other processed foods where a mild acid and a source of calcium are useful. Safety reviews by regulators consider its approved uses to be acceptable.

## At a glance
- What it is: the calcium salt of acetic acid (the acid in vinegar)
- What it does: acidity regulator, preservative, and stabiliser
- Where it’s used: bakery products, desserts, pickled or prepared produce, sauces, and some beverages
- Label names: “calcium acetate” or “E263”
- Other notes: provides calcium ions that can firm plant tissues and help stabilise gels

## Why is Calcium acetate added to food?
Food makers use calcium acetate to manage acidity (pH), which helps control flavor and shelf life. As an acetate salt, it has antimicrobial effects similar to mild vinegar, helping slow the growth of spoilage microbes at permitted levels.[^2] It can also act as a stabiliser, with calcium ions strengthening pectin and other gels in fruit-based foods and confections.[^1]

In the European Union, calcium acetate is an authorised additive (E263) with defined purity specifications and technological roles including acidity regulation and preservation.[^1] EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has reviewed acetic acid and acetate salts (E260–E263) and confirmed their technological need and acceptable use in foods.[^2]

## What foods contain Calcium acetate?
You are most likely to see calcium acetate in:
- Baked goods and bakery mixes (to control pH, preserve freshness, and support dough systems)
- Fruit fillings, jams, and other gelled desserts (for stabilising and pectin setting)
- Prepared fruits and vegetables, including pickled products (for firmness and acidity)
- Dressings, sauces, and condiments (as an acidity regulator)
- Some beverages and drink mixes (for pH control)

Its presence and maximum levels depend on local regulations and the specific food category.[^4]

## What can replace Calcium acetate?
Depending on the goal, manufacturers might use:
- For acidity control: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [sodium acetates](/e262-sodium-acetates), or [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate)
- For preservation: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), depending on the product and pH
- For calcium-driven firming/setting: [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride) or [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate)
- For general acidity in foods that prefer citrus notes: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

Choice of substitute depends on taste, pH target, labeling needs, and local rules.

## How is Calcium acetate made?
Commercially, calcium acetate is produced by reacting a calcium source such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide with acetic acid, then isolating and drying the salt.[^3] This straightforward neutralisation route is typical for many food-grade salts and yields a product that meets official purity specifications for additives in the EU.[^1]

## Is Calcium acetate safe to eat?
EFSA re-evaluated acetic acid and acetate salts (E260–E263) and concluded there is no safety concern at reported uses and exposure levels; a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not considered necessary for this group under the evaluated conditions.[^2] In the EU, its identity and purity are defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, and its uses are governed by the general food additive framework.[^1][^4]

As with any additive, actual permitted uses and maximum levels vary by food category and jurisdiction. Always refer to local regulations for specifics.[^4]

## Does Calcium acetate have any benefits?
- Food quality: It helps keep products stable by controlling pH and supporting gels in fruit fillings and desserts.[^1]
- Shelf life: Its acetate component provides mild antimicrobial action that can slow spoilage at the right pH, supporting freshness.[^2]
- Functional calcium: The calcium ion can contribute to firming in plant-based foods, improving bite and structure.[^1]

It may add a small amount of dietary calcium, but foods rarely contain enough of this additive to be a meaningful mineral source.

## Who should avoid Calcium acetate?
- People on medically supervised, calcium-restricted diets should review labels and consult a clinician if they need to track all calcium sources.
- Individuals with specific sensitivities to acetate-containing ingredients should avoid it.
- For infants and young children, rely on age-appropriate foods; follow guidance from your healthcare provider if there are dietary restrictions.

For most consumers, calcium acetate at permitted levels in foods is considered acceptable by regulators.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Calcium acetate will make food taste like strong vinegar. Fact: At permitted levels, it mainly fine-tunes acidity and does not create a strong vinegar flavor.
- Myth: It is the same as [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate). Fact: Both are preservatives, but they are different chemicals with different taste and performance.
- Myth: It is only a preservative. Fact: It also works as an acidity regulator and stabiliser that can firm textures.

## Calcium acetate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll see “calcium acetate” or “E263.” It commonly appears in packaged breads and bakery items, fruit fillings and toppings, pickled or prepared produce, and sauces where a gentle acidity regulator and stabiliser are needed. If you are checking for it, scan the label near other acid regulators and preservatives such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid).
