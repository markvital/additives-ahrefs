Succistearin (E446) is an emulsifier used mostly to help keep chewy candies—especially chewing gum—soft, uniform, and stable. It is a blend of fat-based compounds made from glycerol, stearic acid, and succinic acid, and it appears on labels as “E446” or “succistearin.”<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: A fat-based emulsifier and texture aid
- Where it’s found: Most commonly in chewing gum
- Why it’s used: Helps soften texture and keep ingredients mixed
- How it’s listed: “Succistearin” or “E446”
- Dietary notes: Source fats are often plant-based; check with brands if you need a confirmed vegan source

## Why is Succistearin added to food?
Food makers add succistearin to help oily and watery parts of a product stay mixed, and to keep the texture soft and uniform. In gum base and other chewy formats, this improves bite and reduces unwanted stickiness during storage and chewing.[^1]

## What foods contain Succistearin?
In the European Union, succistearin is an authorised food additive with specific conditions of use defined in the Union list. In practice, it is mainly associated with chewing gum and similar confectionery formats.[^2] Where present, you’ll see it on the ingredient list as “E446” or “succistearin.”[^1]

## What can replace Succistearin?
Depending on the recipe and local rules, formulators may reach for:
- Other emulsifiers for fat–water mixing, such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [succinylated monoglycerides](/e472g-succinylated-monoglycerides)
- Specialty emulsifiers for confectionery, like [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Texture and moisture helpers such as [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins)

The best substitute depends on the desired texture, flavor release, and regulatory allowances in the target market.

## How is Succistearin made?
Succistearin is defined as a mixture of esters formed from glycerol (a simple alcohol), stearic acid (a common fatty acid), and succinic acid. It is produced by controlled esterification so that the result is a blend tailored for emulsifying and texture functions in foods.[^1] International food standards also list succistearin under its ingredient number (INS 446) with the same identity and use as a food additive.[^3]

## Is Succistearin safe to eat?
Within the European Union, succistearin is on the Union list of permitted additives and must meet detailed purity specifications before it can be used in food.[^1][^2] When manufacturers follow these rules for the intended uses and levels, regulators consider it acceptable for use in food.

## Does Succistearin have any benefits?
Succistearin does not add nutrients, flavor, or sweetness. Its benefits are technological:
- Keeps textures soft and cohesive in gum bases and chewy candies
- Helps disperse flavors and other ingredients evenly
These roles can improve product quality and consistency over shelf life.[^1]

## Who should avoid Succistearin?
- If you follow a strict vegan or certain religious diets, ask the manufacturer about the source of the fatty acids used to make succistearin, as sourcing practices can vary by brand.
- If you are sensitive to any ingredient in a specific product containing E446, follow your healthcare professional’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Succistearin is a sweetener.” Fact: It has no sweetening power; it’s an emulsifier and texture aid.
- Myth: “E446 and E472g are the same.” Fact: Both involve fatty acid esters, but they are different additives with different designations and specifications.
- Myth: “It adds flavor.” Fact: Its role is physical—mixing and texture—not flavoring.

## Succistearin in branded foods
You’re most likely to find succistearin on the labels of chewing gum and some chewy confectionery. It may appear as “succistearin” or “E446,” usually alongside other gum base components and emulsifiers.
