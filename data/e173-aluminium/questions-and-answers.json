      "q": "can you put aluminum foil in an air fryer",
      "a": "Yes—most air fryers allow aluminum foil if used properly: place it only in the basket, don’t cover the entire surface or block vents, and weigh it down so it can’t blow into the heater. Avoid acidic/salty foods on foil (they increase leaching) and follow your model’s instructions.",
