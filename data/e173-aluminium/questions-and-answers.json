      "q": "can you put aluminum foil in an air fryer",
      "a": "Usually yes—if your model’s manual allows it; place foil only in the basket, don’t block airflow holes, keep it away from the heating element, weigh it down with food, and avoid acidic foods that can react with aluminum.",

      "q": "how to cook bacon in the oven with aluminum foil",
      "a": "Heat the oven to about 400°F (200°C), line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, lay bacon in a single layer (on a rack if you want it less greasy), bake 15–20 minutes to desired crispness, then drain and discard or save the rendered fat; the foil makes cleanup easy.",

      "q": "is aluminum a metal",
      "a": "Yes—aluminum is a lightweight, ductile metal and good conductor of heat and electricity; in foods it appears as foil and cookware, and (as E173) as a decorative surface colorant in some regions.",
