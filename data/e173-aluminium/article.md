E173 (aluminum) is a metallic color used to give a silver look to foods in some countries. It is not approved for use in U.S. foods, so U.S. shoppers should avoid products listing “E173,” “aluminum,” or “aluminium” as a color.

## At a glance
- Also called/E-number: E173; Aluminum; Aluminium; element 13
- What it does: Metallic surface color for decoration (silver/gray)
- Common in: EU-only cake and candy decorations; not permitted in U.S. foods
- Diet flags: Not from animals; generally vegan and gluten-free; certification (kosher/halal) varies by supplier

## 1) Why it’s added to food
It adds a metallic shine to the outside of sweets and baked goods. It is for decoration only and not meant to be mixed through the food.

Shopping tip: In the U.S., pick decorations that use FDA-approved color additives instead of E173.

## 2) What foods it’s found in
In the EU, it may appear on the surface of sugar dragées, cake toppers, and pastry decorations. In the U.S., E173 is not an approved food color, so you should not see it on compliant labels.

Shopping tip: Avoid imported decorations that list “E173,” “aluminium,” or “aluminum powder” as a color. Look for labels that list approved FD&C colors or clearly say “edible” and name the specific color additives.

## 3) What are its alternatives
- FDA-approved FD&C colors and their aluminum lakes (for bright, non-metallic colors)
- Mica-based pearlescent pigments in products and uses the FDA allows (check labels for “mica-based pearlescent pigments” and named color additives)
- Colored sugars, cocoa powder, and colored confectionery coatings

Shopping tip: Choose decorations labeled “edible” that list specific FDA-approved color additives. Avoid “non-toxic” craft luster dusts that are not sold as edible.

## 4) How aluminum (E173) is manufactured
Aluminum metal is made from bauxite ore. Makers refine bauxite to alumina, then use electrolytic smelting to get aluminum metal. For E173, the metal is processed into fine powder or flakes under controlled conditions and high purity for decorative use.

## 5) How safe is aluminum (E173) for consumption?
Main point: In the U.S., E173 is not approved for use in foods. Major agencies have assessed aluminum exposure from all sources, and set intake limits to protect consumers.

## 6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
There are no health benefits from eating E173. Some aluminum compounds (like aluminum hydroxide) are used as antacids or phosphate binders, but those are different substances and not E173.

## 7) When aluminum (E173) may be unsafe (contraindications)
- If you have chronic kidney disease, your provider may advise limiting aluminum exposure from all sources. Choose decorations that use approved color additives instead.
- For children, stick to decorations labeled as edible and compliant with U.S. color rules.
- If you have a known sensitivity to metals, avoid imported metallic food decorations.

Shopping tip: In the U.S., avoid products listing “E173” or “aluminium” as a color. Pick decorations that list specific FDA-approved colors.

## E173 in Branded Foods
You are unlikely to find E173 in U.S. branded foods because it is not an approved food color here. Imported decorative confectionery may use it in regions where it is permitted for surface decoration.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is E173 (aluminum) legal in U.S. foods? No. The FDA does not approve metallic aluminum as a food color for U.S. foods.
- What does E173 do in food? It gives a metallic silver look to the outside of candies and baked goods.
- Is E173 safe to eat? Regulators assess total aluminum exposure and set intake limits, but E173 is not allowed in U.S. foods. In places where it is allowed, it is for surface decoration only.
- How can I spot E173 on a label? Look for “E173,” “aluminum,” or “aluminium” listed as a color or ingredient. In the U.S., choose products that list FDA-approved colors instead.
- What can I use instead of E173 for a metallic effect? Choose decorations with approved FD&C colors or mica-based pearlescent pigments where allowed, and make sure labels say “edible” and list specific color additives.
