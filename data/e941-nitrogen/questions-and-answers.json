      "q": "how many valence electrons does nitrogen have",
      "a": "Five; a nitrogen atom has 5 valence electrons (2s2 2p3).",

      "q": "what is nitrogen fixation",
      "a": "Nitrogen fixation is the conversion of atmospheric N2 (E941) into biologically available forms like ammonia by microbes, lightning, or the industrial Haber–Bosch process.",

    {
      "q": "what is nitrogen used for",
      "a": "In foods, E941 is used as an inert propellant and packaging gas to displace oxygen, prevent oxidation, and extend shelf life. Liquid nitrogen is also used for rapid freezing and to create fine bubbles/creamy textures in beverages (e.g., nitro coffee or beer).",

    {
      "q": "is nitrogen a greenhouse gas",
      "a": "No—diatomic nitrogen (N2, E941) is not a greenhouse gas because it does not absorb infrared radiation; nitrous oxide (N2O, E942) is.",

    {
      "q": "what is the nitrogen cycle",
      "a": "The nitrogen cycle is the movement of nitrogen among the atmosphere, soils, water, and living organisms. It includes fixation of N2 (E941) into reactive forms, biological uptake, and return to N2 via processes like denitrification.",
