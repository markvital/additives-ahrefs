Ethyl lauroyl arginate (E243) is a food preservative that helps keep foods fresh by slowing the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Made from lauric acid, the amino acid L-arginine, and ethanol, it is often listed on labels as LAE or ethyl lauroyl arginate.

## At a glance
- Role: preservative that inhibits microbes to extend shelf life.
- Label names: E243, ethyl lauroyl arginate, LAE, ethyl lauroyl arginate hydrochloride (LAE HCl).
- Where it’s used: selected ready-to-eat foods like processed meats, fish products, and sauces (use depends on local rules).
- Taste/texture: used at very low levels and is designed to have little effect on flavor or texture.
- Regulatory status: approved in the European Union (EU) as E243; some uses are the subject of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) notices to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
- Typical use levels: low “parts-per-million” ranges, set by law where allowed.

## Why is Ethyl lauroyl arginate added to food?
Producers add ethyl lauroyl arginate to slow the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microbes. It is a cationic (positively charged) surface-active molecule that disrupts microbial cell membranes, which helps keep foods safe for longer.

## What foods contain Ethyl lauroyl arginate?
In the EU, E243 is authorized for use only in specific food categories and at set maximum levels, as listed in Annex II to the EU food additives regulation and its updates.[^2] In practice, that means you may see it on the labels of certain processed meats, fish products, and sauces, depending on the country and product type. In the United States, manufacturers have submitted GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) notices to FDA for its use in selected foods; always check the ingredient list for “ethyl lauroyl arginate,” “LAE,” or “E243.”[^3]

## What can replace Ethyl lauroyl arginate?
Depending on the recipe and local rules, formulators may consider:
- Organic acids and salts such as [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- Natural antimicrobials like [nisin](/e234-nisin) or [natamycin](/e235-natamycin)
- Antioxidant-based options such as [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- pH control with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to make conditions less friendly to microbes

## How is Ethyl lauroyl arginate made?
Ethyl lauroyl arginate is produced by combining lauric acid (from sources like coconut or palm kernel oils) with the amino acid L-arginine to form a lauroyl–arginine amide, then esterifying the molecule with ethanol; the final product is typically stabilized as the hydrochloride salt (LAE HCl).[^1]

## Is Ethyl lauroyl arginate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for ethyl lauroyl arginate.[^1] In the EU, its use is restricted to certain foods and maximum permitted levels to help keep intake within that ADI.[^2] In the United States, certain uses have been the subject of FDA GRAS notices, meaning qualified experts consider those specific uses safe under the conditions described to the agency.[^3]

## Does Ethyl lauroyl arginate have any benefits?
Yes. When used as directed, LAE can extend shelf life and help control harmful bacteria in ready-to-eat foods, such as Listeria in some processed meats and seafood.[^3] This can reduce food waste and help maintain product safety while keeping flavors and textures stable at the low levels used.

## Who should avoid Ethyl lauroyl arginate?
- Anyone with a diagnosed sensitivity to this ingredient should avoid it.
- People on medically supervised diets should review labels and consult their healthcare professional.
- Infants and young children should only consume foods intended for their age group; always follow product guidance from health authorities and pediatricians.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “LAE is a harsh chemical.” Fact: It is made from building blocks found in foods (a fatty acid, an amino acid, and ethanol) and is used at very low levels.
- Myth: “It stays in the body.” Fact: LAE is expected to break down to arginine, lauric acid, and ethanol—substances the body can handle through normal metabolism.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s an antibiotic.” Fact: LAE is a food preservative; it works on microbial membranes and is not used to treat infections in people.

## Ethyl lauroyl arginate in branded foods
On labels, look for “ethyl lauroyl arginate,” “LAE,” or “E243.” You’re most likely to find it in certain ready-to-eat meats, fish products, and sauces where regulators allow its use. Availability varies by country, so products sold in one market may not use E243 in another.
