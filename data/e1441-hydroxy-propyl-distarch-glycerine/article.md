Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine (E1441) is a modified starch used to thicken and stabilize foods. It helps sauces, desserts, and fillings stay smooth, even when heated, frozen, or mixed. You’ll see it most often in processed foods that need steady texture over time.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant starch that’s been gently changed to make it more stable in cooking and storage
- What it does: thickens, stabilizes, and keeps textures smooth; adds freeze–thaw and heat stability
- Where it’s used: soups, sauces, dairy-style desserts, pie fillings, plant-based drinks, and ready meals
- Diet notes: essentially carbohydrate; gluten-free if made from gluten-free starch; check the label for source
- Regulation: authorized in the EU with specifications; permitted in the U.S. as a type of “food starch-modified”

## Why is Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine added to food?
Food makers use E1441 because it gives reliable, smooth thickness that holds up under heat, acidity, and mixing. It helps prevent watery “weeping” in gels and fillings, improves freeze–thaw stability in frozen foods, and keeps emulsions from separating during shelf life.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine?
You’re most likely to find E1441 in:
- Canned and instant soups and sauces
- Gravy mixes and ready meals
- Fruit preparations and pie fillings
- Spoonable and frozen desserts
- Plant-based milks and flavored dairy-style drinks
- Low-fat spreads and dressings

On ingredient lists, it may appear as “E1441,” “hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine,” or “modified starch.”

## What can replace Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine?
Depending on the recipe, similar texture and stability can come from:
- Other modified starches, such as [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate), [acetylated distarch adipate](/e1422-acetylated-distarch-adipate), or [acetylated distarch phosphate](/e1414-acetylated-distarch-phosphate)
- Gums and hydrocolloids like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), or [pectins](/e440-pectins)

The best swap depends on processing (heat, shear), pH, and whether the product is frozen.

## How is Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine made?
E1441 starts as a common food starch (often corn, potato, or tapioca). Manufacturers add small numbers of hydroxypropyl groups and create gentle links between starch chains using glycerine (glycerol). These changes make the starch more stable in heat and acid and less likely to break down during processing. The EU sets clear identity and purity rules for this additive, including how it may be produced and tested.[^1]

## Is Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine safe to eat?
In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated modified starches and concluded they do not raise safety concerns at reported use levels; a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^2] In the United States, “food starch-modified” (the regulatory category that includes this type of starch) is permitted as a food additive when manufactured and used according to good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Does Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine have any benefits?
For consumers, E1441 helps foods keep a pleasing, consistent texture. It can reduce watery separation in sauces and fruit fillings, improve freeze–thaw quality in frozen items, and help lower-fat recipes feel creamy without adding much fat.

## Who should avoid Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine?
Most people don’t need to avoid E1441. If you have a wheat allergy or celiac disease, check the label: in the U.S., any wheat-derived ingredient must declare “wheat,” and in the EU many products now indicate gluten-free status if applicable.[^4] If you’re on a medically restricted carbohydrate diet, talk with your clinician, since this additive is a source of carbohydrate.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as a sweetener.” Fact: E1441 is not a sweetener; it’s a texture agent.
- Myth: “It’s just filler.” Fact: It plays a functional role, helping foods survive cooking, freezing, and transport without separating.
- Fact: Its manufacture and purity are regulated, with specifications for identity and safety tests set in EU law.[^1]

## Hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine in branded foods
Look for “E1441” or “modified starch (hydroxy propyl distarch glycerine)” on EU labels. In the U.S., it typically appears as “modified food starch.” You’ll see it across many brands in soups, sauces, desserts, frozen meals, and fruit fillings where reliable thickness and stability are needed.
