  "description": "The glucose oxidase enzyme -GOx- also known as notatin -EC number 1.1.3.4- is an oxido-reductase that catalyses the oxidation of glucose to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-δ-lactone. This enzyme is produced by certain species of fungi and insects and displays antibacterial activity when oxygen and glucose are present.  Glucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in body fluids -diagnostics-, in vegetal raw material, and in the food industry. It also has many applications in biotechnologies, typically enzyme assays for biochemistry including biosensors in nanotechnologies. It was first isolated by Detlev Müller in 1928 from Aspergillus niger.",
