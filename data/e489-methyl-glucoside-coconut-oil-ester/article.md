Methyl glucoside-coconut oil ester (E489) is a sugar–fatty acid ester used as an emulsifier, helping oil and water mix smoothly in foods. It is made by combining methyl glucoside, a sugar derivative, with fatty acids from coconut oil to improve texture and stability in creamy or foamy products. Availability and approval can differ by country, so you may or may not see E489 on local ingredient lists.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made from methyl glucoside and coconut oil fatty acids.
- What it does: Helps oil and water mix; stabilizes foams and creams; improves smoothness.
- Typical uses: Creamers, whipped toppings, desserts, sauces, and confectionery-style fillings.
- Dietary notes: Based on plant sources (sugar derivative and coconut oil); usually suitable for vegetarians and vegans.
- Label reading: May appear as “E489,” “INS 489,” or “methyl glucoside-coconut oil ester.”
- Regulation: Approval varies by country; always check local rules and your product label.

## Why is E489 added to food?
Food makers add E489 to keep oil and water from separating, to stabilize air bubbles in foams, and to give a smoother mouthfeel in products like creamers and toppings. In international references, it is classified as an emulsifier under the International Numbering System (INS 489).[^1]

## What foods contain E489?
You are most likely to find E489 in foods that need stable emulsions or foams. Examples include:
- Powdered and liquid non-dairy creamers
- Whipped toppings and dessert mixes
- Sauces, gravies, and instant soups
- Filled chocolates or confectionery-style centers

Because approval varies by region, the actual presence of E489 depends on local regulations and manufacturers’ recipes. Check ingredient lists for “E489” or “methyl glucoside-coconut oil ester.”

## What can replace E489?
Several other emulsifiers and stabilizers can do similar jobs, depending on the recipe:
- Emulsifiers: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids), [citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Stabilizers/thickeners: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)

The best substitute depends on the desired texture (creamy, airy, pourable) and the food’s fat and water content.

## How is E489 made?
E489 is produced by esterifying methyl glucoside (a glucose-based compound) with a mix of fatty acids sourced from coconut oil, which is rich in lauric, myristic, and other medium-chain fatty acids. The result is a blend of esters that are particularly effective at sitting at the oil–water interface, stabilizing emulsions. Manufacturers select process conditions to control the degree of esterification and performance in different foods.

## Is E489 safe to eat?
E-numbers are used in the European Union (EU) to label additives that have been assessed and authorized, but not every number you may see in global references appears on the EU’s current authorized list. Regulatory status for E489 can therefore differ by market; always check your local rules and product labels.[^2] Internationally, Codex Alimentarius (the joint FAO/WHO food standards program) lists “Methyl glucoside-coconut oil esters” as INS 489 in its additives database, which many countries consult when setting their own rules.[^1]

People with coconut allergies sometimes worry about coconut-derived additives. Highly refined oils and their derivatives typically contain little to no protein—the part of food that triggers allergic reactions—and in the United States, such highly refined oils are exempt from “major food allergen” labeling requirements.[^3] If you have a medically diagnosed allergy, discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.

## Does E489 have any benefits?
- Smoother texture and improved mouthfeel in creamy foods
- Better foam and emulsion stability, reducing separation
- Helps deliver consistent quality across shelf life

These are technological (process/quality) benefits rather than nutritional benefits.

## Who should avoid E489?
- Individuals with known sensitivities who are advised to avoid certain emulsifiers should consult their clinician before consuming products with E489.
- Those managing food allergies to coconut may wish to check labels and contact manufacturers, even though refined-oil derivatives typically have very low protein.[^3]
- If your local regulations do not authorize E489, you are unlikely to find it in retail foods; when in doubt, verify label information against local rules.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “An E-number means an additive is artificial and unsafe.”
  Fact: In the EU, an E-number simply shows the additive has been evaluated and authorized; safety depends on the specific additive and conditions of use.[^2]
- Myth: “Methyl glucoside-coconut oil ester is the same as sucrose esters.”
  Fact: Both are sugar–fatty acid esters, but they are different substances with different properties and approvals.
- Myth: “Coconut-derived additives always trigger coconut allergies.”
  Fact: Allergen reactions are caused by proteins; highly refined oils and their derivatives usually contain negligible protein, though individuals with allergies should seek medical advice.[^3]

## E489 in branded foods
If used where permitted, E489 may appear on ingredient lists as “E489,” “INS 489,” or “methyl glucoside-coconut oil ester.” You’re most likely to see it in creamy or aerated items such as non-dairy creamers, whipped toppings, instant desserts, sauces, and certain confectionery fillings. Because regulations vary, product availability with E489 can differ by country; when in doubt, check the label and local regulatory databases.[^1][^2]
