Microcrystalline cellulose (E460i) is a purified, plant-based form of cellulose used to build texture, keep mixtures stable, and carry other ingredients. It is not digested by the body and works like dietary fiber in foods. It is common in many everyday products, from baked goods to sauces.

## At a glance
- What it is: Purified cellulose made from plants, processed into very fine particles.
- What it does: Works as a bulking agent, stabiliser, thickener, anti-caking aid, and carrier for flavors or colors.
- Taste and calories: Neutral taste and essentially no calories; contributes texture, not sweetness.
- Typical foods: Baked goods, dairy desserts, sauces and dressings, plant-based meats, and snack coatings.
- Regulation: Authorized as E460(i) in the EU and assessed as safe by major authorities.

## Why is Microcrystalline cellulose added to food?
Food makers use microcrystalline cellulose (often called MCC) to improve texture and stability. It helps suspend particles, prevents separation, thickens liquids, and gives low-fat or reduced-sugar foods a creamy body. It can also stop clumping in powders and act as a carrier for flavors or colors in dry blends.[^3]

## What foods contain Microcrystalline cellulose?
You can find E460(i) in a wide range of products where smooth, stable texture matters. Examples include:
- Breads, tortillas, and pastries
- Ice cream, frozen desserts, and whipped toppings
- Sauces, gravies, and salad dressings
- Plant-based burgers and sausages
- Seasoning mixes and drink powders

In the European Union (EU), E460(i) is an authorized food additive with defined purity specifications, so it may be used in many categories listed in EU additive law.[^1]

## What can replace Microcrystalline cellulose?
Depending on the job it does in a recipe, formulators may swap MCC with:
- Other hydrocolloids and gums, such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- Fiber-like thickeners, such as [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- Starches, including some types of [modified starch](/e14xx-modified-starch)
- Anti-caking agents like [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide)
- Other cellulose derivatives when a different texture is needed, such as [sodium carboxymethyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose)

The best substitute depends on the food, water content, pH (acidity), and processing conditions.

## How is Microcrystalline cellulose made?
MCC starts as cellulose from plant sources like wood pulp or cotton. Producers use controlled acid hydrolysis to remove amorphous (less ordered) regions of cellulose, leaving behind crystalline particles. After neutralizing, washing, and drying, the material is milled to a fine, free-flowing powder that meets strict purity specifications for food use.[^3][^1]

## Is Microcrystalline cellulose safe to eat?
Major authorities have reviewed MCC and other celluloses and found no safety concerns at reported use levels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there was no need for a numerical ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) for the celluloses group, including E460(i).[^2] In the United States, microcrystalline cellulose is affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) for use in food under its conditions of use.[^4]

## Does Microcrystalline cellulose have any benefits?
For consumers, MCC contributes body and creaminess to foods without adding sugar or fat. It also behaves like dietary fiber because it is not digested or absorbed to any significant extent, and it passes through the gut largely unchanged.[^2] For manufacturers, it improves stability and reduces syneresis (water weeping) in products like sauces and dairy desserts.[^3]

ADI means Acceptable Daily Intake, a scientific estimate of the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without risk.

## Who should avoid Microcrystalline cellulose?
Most people can consume MCC without issues. However:
- Individuals who are sensitive to sudden increases in fiber may experience gas or bloating if they consume large amounts at once.
- People advised to follow a low-fiber diet (for example, before or after certain medical procedures) should check labels and follow their clinician’s guidance.
- As with any ingredient, those with specific medical conditions should consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just sawdust.” Myth. Food-grade MCC is highly purified cellulose produced under controlled conditions and must meet strict identity and purity standards.[^1]
- “It’s a chemical filler with no purpose.” Myth. MCC provides structure, stabilisation, and anti-caking functions that keep foods consistent and enjoyable.[^3]
- “Your body absorbs it.” Myth. MCC is not meaningfully digested or absorbed and behaves like dietary fiber.[^2]

## Microcrystalline cellulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “microcrystalline cellulose,” “MCC,” or “E460(i).” You’ll often see it in:
- Tortillas and sliced bread for softness and uniform texture
- Ice creams and dairy desserts for creaminess and meltdown control
- Plant-based meats for juiciness and bite
- Seasoning packets and drink mixes to prevent clumping
- Chewing gum and confectionery for structure

Availability and usage can vary by brand and region. Check the ingredient list to confirm.
