## Why it matters
- Loosens dead skin cells inside pores, reducing blackheads and whiteheads.
- Has calming properties that temper redness and breakout-related irritation.
- Effective in leave-on exfoliants from 0.5% to 2% and in targeted acne spot treatments.

## How to use it
- Apply liquid or gel exfoliants on clean, dry skin once daily or a few times per week.
- Pair with niacinamide or azelaic acid to address persistent post-acne marks.
- Avoid layering with strong retinoids or other exfoliants in the same routine if skin feels sensitized.
