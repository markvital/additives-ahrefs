## Why skincare formulators use it
Salicylic acid dissolves excess sebum inside the pore lining, making it ideal for blemish-prone and oily skin. It also offers gentle anti-inflammatory benefits to calm active breakouts.

## Things to know
Concentrations typically range from 0.5% to 2% in leave-on products. Combining it with soothing agents like green tea or panthenol can offset dryness, while low pH ensures effective exfoliation.

## Popular formats
Expect to see it in clarifying toners, spot treatments, and foaming cleansers. Daily micro-dosed serums are increasingly popular for maintaining clear skin without over-exfoliating.
