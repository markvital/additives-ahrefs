      "q": "who makes the e170 aircraft",
      "a": "In food labeling, E170 refers to calcium carbonates, not an aircraft; theyâ€™re made by many ingredient suppliers, typically sourced from mined limestone or produced by reacting calcium hydroxide with carbon dioxide (precipitated calcium carbonate).",

      "q": "who makes e170 airplane",
      "a": "E170 in foods means calcium carbonates, not an airplane; they are supplied by numerous food-grade mineral producers, either mined (ground calcium carbonate) or made by precipitation from calcium hydroxide and CO2.",

      "q": "calcium carbonates is most likeye to dissolve in water with which characteristics",
      "a": "Calcium carbonate is nearly insoluble in neutral water but dissolves in acidic or carbonated water (low pH, high dissolved CO2) by forming calcium bicarbonate.",

      "q": "e170 aircraft who makes",
      "a": "On food labels, E170 denotes calcium carbonates rather than an aircraft; they are manufactured by various companies from limestone or via precipitation using calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.",

    {
      "q": "how are calcium carbonates formed",
      "a": "They form naturally by precipitation of calcium and carbonate ions in water and by biomineralization in shells and eggs, and industrially by reacting calcium hydroxide with carbon dioxide (precipitated calcium carbonate); they can also precipitate from hard water as limescale.",
