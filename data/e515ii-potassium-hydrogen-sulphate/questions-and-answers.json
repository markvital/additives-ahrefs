      "q": "why are there differences in the solubility of calcium chloride and of potassium bisulphate",
      "a": "Because their ions differ in charge, size and hydration: CaCl2 has very favorable hydration enthalpy (Ca2+ and Cl−), making it highly soluble and hygroscopic, while for KHSO4 the larger HSO4− anion and hydrogen-bonded crystal structure make the overall balance of lattice energy vs hydration less favorable, so it dissolves less readily (also varying with pH and temperature).",
