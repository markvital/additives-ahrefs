Sodiumglycinate (E640ii) is the sodium salt of glycine, a simple amino acid. It is used mainly as a flavor enhancer that smooths or rounds out taste in foods and drinks. In the EU it is part of the additive pair “glycine and its sodium salt” listed as E640.

## At a glance

- What it is: The sodium salt of the amino acid glycine (also called sodium glycinate), assigned E640ii in the EU.
- What it does: Works as a flavor enhancer; it can help balance sweetness, saltiness, and acidity.
- Where it’s used: Processed foods and beverages where a mild taste-mellowing or flavor-rounding effect is desired.
- Dietary notes: Contributes a small amount of sodium; otherwise not a common allergen.
- Regulation: Authorized in the EU under E640 (glycine and its sodium salt); glycine is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the U.S.

## Why is Sodiumglycinate added to food?

Sodiumglycinate is added as a flavor enhancer. It helps round off harsh notes, smooth bitterness or acidity, and improve overall taste balance without adding a strong flavor of its own.[^1] In the EU, it is authorized under the grouping “glycine and its sodium salt” (E640) as a food additive for flavor enhancement.[^1]

In the United States, glycine (the parent compound of sodiumglycinate) is listed as GRAS and may be used as a flavoring agent or adjuvant, nutrient supplement, pH control agent, or processing aid when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^2]

## What foods contain Sodiumglycinate?

Manufacturers may use sodiumglycinate in:
- Beverages (including some flavored or sports drinks)
- Sauces, soups, and seasonings
- Baked goods and fillings
- Confectionery and chewing gum
- Ready meals and snack foods

Labeling can vary by region. In the EU, it may appear as “E640,” “E640ii,” “sodium glycinate,” or “glycine, sodium salt.” In other markets, look for “sodium glycinate” or “glycine (sodium salt)” in the ingredients list.

## What can replace Sodiumglycinate?

Depending on the recipe goal, possible alternatives include:
- [Glycine](/e640i-glycine) (E640i) for similar taste-rounding with no added sodium
- [Monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) (MSG) for umami lift
- [Disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate) or [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate) for savory enhancement
- Recipe tweaks such as adjusting sugar, salt, acids (like citric acid), or using yeast extract to balance flavor

## How is Sodiumglycinate made?

Food-grade sodiumglycinate is typically produced by neutralizing glycine with a food-grade sodium base (such as sodium hydroxide), followed by purification. In the EU, its identity and purity must meet the official additive specifications set for E640 (glycine and its sodium salt).[^3]

## Is Sodiumglycinate safe to eat?

In the European Union, E640 (glycine and its sodium salt) is an authorized food additive, which means it passed safety evaluation and can be used under the conditions set in EU law.[^1] Specifications covering identity and purity are laid out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

In the United States, glycine is GRAS for specified technical uses when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^2] While sodiumglycinate contributes sodium, the amounts in foods are usually small; still, people limiting sodium should consider total dietary sources of sodium.[^4]

## Does Sodiumglycinate have any benefits?

- Technological benefits: It can smooth harsh flavors, help mask bitterness or acidity, and fine-tune overall taste.
- Formulation benefits: It may support pH adjustment alongside other ingredients, helping maintain consistent flavor over shelf life.

These benefits are about food quality and taste; sodiumglycinate is not used as a nutrient supplement in the same way that glycine may be in some U.S. applications.[^2]

## Who should avoid Sodiumglycinate?

- People on sodium-restricted diets (for example, those managing high blood pressure, certain heart conditions, or chronic kidney disease) should be mindful that sodiumglycinate adds to total sodium intake, even if only modestly per serving.[^4]
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to a product containing E640 should follow their healthcare provider’s advice.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “Sodiumglycinate is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are different compounds with different E-numbers and taste effects; MSG is E621, while sodiumglycinate is part of E640.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: Sodiumglycinate is used mainly as a flavor enhancer, not to preserve food.
- Myth: “It adds a strong taste.” Fact: At normal use levels, it tends to smooth and balance flavors rather than add a distinct taste.

## Sodiumglycinate in branded foods

You can spot it on ingredient lists as “E640,” “E640ii,” “sodium glycinate,” or “glycine (sodium salt).” Products that focus on flavor smoothness—such as certain beverages, sauces, or snacks—are more likely to use it. If you’re tracking sodium intake, check the Nutrition Facts panel for total sodium as well as the ingredient list.
