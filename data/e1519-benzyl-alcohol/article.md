Benzyl alcohol (E1519) is an aromatic alcohol used in foods mainly as a flavoring substance and as a solvent or carrier for flavorings and colors. It has a faint, slightly sweet aroma and helps dissolve ingredients that do not mix well with water.

## At a glance
- Names: benzyl alcohol, phenylmethyl alcohol, phenylcarbinol; E-number E1519
- What it does: flavoring; solvent/carrier for flavorings and some colors
- Where it’s used: flavored drinks, confectionery, desserts, baked goods, and flavor concentrates
- Labeling: “benzyl alcohol” or “E1519” (EU/UK); sometimes appears within a flavor preparation
- Regulatory status: permitted as a flavoring substance in the U.S.; listed as E1519 with EU specifications

## Why is Benzyl alcohol added to food?
Food makers use benzyl alcohol because it can contribute a mild aromatic note and, importantly, because it dissolves many flavor compounds that are hard to handle in water. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists benzyl alcohol as a permitted synthetic flavoring substance and adjuvant, to be used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, it is designated E1519 and has official identity and purity specifications set in law.[^3] Authorised uses and any limits are established in the EU food additives framework legislation.[^4]

## What foods contain Benzyl alcohol?
You are most likely to encounter benzyl alcohol in flavored products where it can serve as part of a flavor blend or as the carrier that keeps that blend uniform. Examples include:
- Soft drinks and syrups
- Candies and chocolates
- Ice creams and desserts
- Baked goods and fillings
- Flavor concentrates used by manufacturers and bakers

It may appear on labels by its name or E-number, or it may be present within a declared flavor preparation depending on local labeling rules.

## What can replace Benzyl alcohol?
Depending on why it is used (as a solvent/carrier or for a slight flavor note), formulators might switch to:
- [Ethanol](/e1510-ethanol) for dissolving many natural extracts
- [Propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol) as a common flavor carrier
- [Glycerol](/e422-glycerol) when a humectant and carrier are both desired
- [Triethyl citrate](/e1505-triethyl-citrate) as a relatively neutral, food-grade solvent
- [Ethyl acetate](/e1504-ethyl-acetate) for certain extract applications

The best substitute depends on solubility needs, taste neutrality, and the regulations for the intended food.

## How is Benzyl alcohol made?
Food-grade benzyl alcohol is produced synthetically and then purified. For use as E1519 in the EU, it must meet official specifications for identity and purity (for example, minimum assay and limits for certain impurities) as defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

## Is Benzyl alcohol safe to eat?
Regulators have evaluated benzyl alcohol for use in foods. In the U.S., FDA permits it as a synthetic flavoring substance and adjuvant when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, it is a listed food additive (E1519) with specifications and authorised use conditions in the food-additive legislation.[^4] In the body, benzyl alcohol is mainly converted to benzoic acid and then excreted as hippuric acid, a normal metabolite.[^5]

## Does Benzyl alcohol have any benefits?
In foods, its benefits are technological rather than nutritional:
- Helps dissolve and carry flavor compounds uniformly
- Contributes a mild, pleasant aromatic note in some formulations
- Can improve the stability and handling of flavor systems

## Who should avoid Benzyl alcohol?
- Anyone with a diagnosed allergy or sensitivity to benzyl alcohol should avoid it and check ingredient lists.
- For infants, especially premature newborns, medicines containing benzyl alcohol have been linked to serious adverse events; while this relates to medications and not foods, it highlights a need for particular caution in this age group when advised by healthcare professionals.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Benzyl alcohol is the same as benzene.” Fact: It is a different compound; benzyl alcohol is an alcohol, not a hydrocarbon.
- Myth: “It always acts as a preservative in foods.” Fact: In foods, it is primarily used as a flavoring or carrier; it is not typically used as a food preservative.
- Myth: “If it’s in a product, it must have a strong ‘alcohol’ taste.” Fact: At typical use levels, benzyl alcohol does not make foods taste boozy; it contributes a mild aromatic note or simply carries flavors.

## E1519 in branded foods
On European labels, look for “benzyl alcohol” or “E1519.” In other markets, it may appear by name or be part of a declared flavoring. It is most often found in flavored beverages, candies, desserts, and bakery items where complex flavor blends are used.
