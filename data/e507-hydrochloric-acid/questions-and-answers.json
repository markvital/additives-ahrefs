      "q": "is hydrochloric acid a strong acid",
      "a": "Yes—hydrochloric acid (E507) is a strong mineral acid that dissociates almost completely in water; in foods it’s used only in dilute amounts.",

      "q": "what is hydrochloric acid used for",
      "a": "In foods, E507 is used to acidify and control pH, and as a processing aid in sugar/starch hydrolysis and gelatin production.",

    {
      "q": "what does hydrochloric acid do",
      "a": "It lowers pH to adjust acidity for flavor, texture, and microbial control, and can catalyze hydrolysis reactions during processing. Any residual acid is typically neutralized or highly diluted in the final product.",

    {
      "q": "is hydrochloric acid dangerous",
      "a": "Concentrated hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive and can cause severe burns and harmful fumes. In foods, food‑grade HCl used at good manufacturing practice levels is considered safe (GRAS in the U.S.; permitted as E507 in the EU).",

    {
      "q": "is hydrochloric acid flammable",
      "a": "No—hydrochloric acid is non‑flammable, though it can react with some metals to release flammable hydrogen gas and emits corrosive fumes.",
