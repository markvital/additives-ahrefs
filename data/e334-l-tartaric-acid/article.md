L(+)-tartaric acid (E334) is a natural fruit acid best known from grapes and wine. It gives a sharp, clean sour taste and helps control acidity and metal ions in foods. You’ll find it in drinks, candies, and some baking mixes where a strong tart note is desired.

## At a glance
This additive is a naturally occurring acid that shapes taste and stability in many foods.
- Name: L(+)-tartaric acid (E334)
- What it does: acidulant (adds sourness), antioxidant, and sequestrant (binds metal ions)
- Typical uses: soft drinks, sour candies, jellies, dessert mixes, and wine making
- Regulatory status: approved in the EU as E334 and affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) in the U.S. when used under good manufacturing practice

## Why is L(+)-tartaric acid added to food?
Food makers use L(+)-tartaric acid to add a bright, tart flavor and to set a desired pH (acidity). It can protect flavor, color, and texture by binding trace metals (that’s what a “sequestrant” does) and by limiting unwanted reactions that lead to off-colors or off-flavors. It also supports the gelling of high‑methoxyl pectin in jams and jellies by providing the right acidity.

## What foods contain L(+)-tartaric acid?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Beverages: fruit-flavored soft drinks, energy drinks, and powdered drink mixes
- Confectionery: sour gummies and hard candies
- Jams and jellies: to control pH and set gels
- Baking mixes and dessert powders: for tartness and acid balance
- Wine production: winemakers may add L‑tartaric acid to adjust acidity in grape wines under U.S. rules[^3]

Related salts such as [sodium tartrates](/e335-sodium-tartrates) and [potassium tartrates](/e336-potassium-tartrates) are also used in foods, sometimes alongside E334.

## What can replace L(+)-tartaric acid?
Depending on the job, common stand‑ins include:
- For sourness and pH control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), or [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid) for very strong acidity
- For a “cola‑style” acid profile: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- For antioxidant or sequestrant roles: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), depending on the recipe

The best substitute depends on taste, solubility, pH range, and label goals.

## How is L(+)-tartaric acid made?
Most commercial L(+)-tartaric acid comes from by‑products of winemaking (like grape lees and tartrate crystals), which are purified to yield the L(+) isomer permitted for food use in the EU specifications.[^1] It can also be produced by controlled processes that ensure the L(+) form. In nature, tartaric acid is abundant in grapes and present in wine and several other fruits.[^2]

## Is L(+)-tartaric acid safe to eat?
In the United States, tartaric acid is affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) when used in line with good manufacturing practice (GMP), which means only the amount needed for the intended technical effect is used.[^4] In the European Union, only the L(+) isomer is authorized as food additive E334, with identity and purity specifications set by law.[^1]

## Does L(+)-tartaric acid have any benefits?
For food makers, it offers:
- A clean, strong tart taste that complements grape, berry, and citrus flavors
- Reliable pH control, which supports gel formation in jams and helps preserve color
- Metal‑ion binding (sequestration), which can reduce browning and off‑flavors in some recipes

These are technological benefits in foods, not medical benefits.

## Who should avoid L(+)-tartaric acid?
- People sensitive to acidic foods may experience mouth or stomach irritation from very sour products.
- Those advised to limit dietary acids (for example, due to certain dental or gastrointestinal issues) may wish to moderate intake of very tart candies and drinks.
- Infants and young children are more sensitive to high‑acid sour candies and drinks; parents may prefer milder options.

If you have a specific medical condition, follow your clinician’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are artificial chemicals.” Fact: Many are natural or nature‑identical. L(+)-tartaric acid occurs naturally in grapes and wine.
- Myth: “Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are the same.” Fact: Cream of tartar is a salt (potassium bitartrate). E334 is the free acid. Both are part of the tartrate family used in foods.
- Myth: “Tartaric acid is banned.” Fact: It is authorized in the EU (as E334) and affirmed as GRAS in the U.S. when used under GMP.

## L(+)-tartaric acid in branded foods
On labels, look for “tartaric acid,” “L(+)-tartaric acid,” or “E334” (in regions that use E‑numbers). You’ll most often see it in:
- Sour gummies, hard candies, and powdered drink mixes for a strong tart kick
- Fruit jams, jellies, and dessert gels for pH control
- Certain carbonated and still beverages
- Some baking mixes; related tartrates may also appear in baking powders
