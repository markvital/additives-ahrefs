Metatartaric acid (E353) is a processed form of tartaric acid used mainly in winemaking to keep tiny tartrate crystals from forming in the bottle. It helps wines stay clear and visually stable without changing their flavor when used at the allowed levels. It is authorized in the EU and has been evaluated for safety by EFSA.

## At a glance

- What it is: A polymer made by heating [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid); used as a stabilizer in wine.
- What it does: Helps prevent tartrate crystals from forming and settling in bottled wine.
- Where it’s found: Primarily in still and sparkling wines in regions where it’s permitted.
- Common alternatives: Cold stabilization, contact seeding, electrodialysis; additive alternative includes [sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (E466)](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose).
- Safety: Evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with no safety concern at reported uses and levels.

## Why is Metatartaric acid added to food?

Metatartaric acid is added to wine to reduce or delay the precipitation of tartrate crystals, which can appear as harmless “wine diamonds” in the bottle or glass. By keeping these salts in solution, it improves the wine’s visual stability and shelf presentation, especially for wines that are bottled and consumed relatively young.[^2]

In the European Union, the use of metatartaric acid in wine is an authorized oenological practice specifically for tartaric stabilization, with defined conditions of use.[^2]

## What foods contain Metatartaric acid?

You’ll most often encounter metatartaric acid in still and sparkling wines. Its authorized use in the EU is tied to winemaking (oenological practices), rather than broad use across many food categories.[^2]

## What can replace Metatartaric acid?

Winemakers have several options to control tartrate crystals without metatartaric acid:
- Process choices: Cold stabilization (chilling the wine so crystals form and can be removed), contact seeding with potassium bitartrate, or membrane methods such as electrodialysis.
- Additive alternative: [Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, E466)](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose), which is also used to inhibit tartrate crystallization under permitted conditions in many regions.

These approaches are selected based on the wine style, desired shelf life, and regulatory allowances.

## How is Metatartaric acid made?

Metatartaric acid is produced by heating [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), a natural acid from grapes and wine by-products. The heat treatment causes tartaric acid molecules to link together (partial esterification/condensation), creating a polymeric material with stabilizing properties in wine.[^1]

## Is Metatartaric acid safe to eat?

EFSA re-evaluated metatartaric acid (E353) as a food additive and concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels.[^3] In wine, metatartaric acid gradually breaks back down (hydrolyzes) into tartaric acid over time, which is a normal wine acid also present naturally in grapes.[^3]

Its use in EU winemaking is regulated, including conditions and maximum levels, which helps keep intake within safe bounds.[^2]

## Does Metatartaric acid have any benefits?

- Helps wines remain visually clear by limiting tartrate crystal formation in the bottle.
- Supports product consistency during distribution and storage.
- Offers a tool for producers who want to avoid more energy-intensive stabilization steps (for example, very low-temperature chilling).

These benefits apply to appropriate wine styles and time frames, since the effect can diminish as the polymer slowly hydrolyzes.

## Who should avoid Metatartaric acid?

Metatartaric acid is not known to be a common allergen. If you prefer wines made without this kind of additive, look for producers who state they use physical stabilization methods (such as cold stabilization), or consult a wine’s technical sheet. People who avoid alcohol for medical or personal reasons should avoid wine altogether.

## Myths & facts

- “Those crystals in wine are glass.” Myth. They are tartrate salts and are harmless. Metatartaric acid is used to help keep them from forming noticeable crystals.
- “Metatartaric acid makes wine taste sour.” Mostly false. It’s used at very low levels for stability, not for taste, and it gradually converts to tartaric acid already present in wine.[^3]
- “It’s a synthetic chemical unrelated to grapes.” Misleading. It is made by heating tartaric acid, which is a natural grape acid, to form a polymer with stabilizing properties.[^1]

## Metatartaric acid in branded foods

You’ll typically see metatartaric acid in commercial white, rosé, and sparkling wines where tartrate stability matters most. Some producers list it on ingredient statements or technical sheets as “metatartaric acid” or “E353.” If you want to check a particular brand, look for that wording on the label or the winery’s product page.
