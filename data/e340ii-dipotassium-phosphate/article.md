Dipotassium phosphate (E340ii) is a food-grade salt that helps keep foods stable and at the right acidity. It’s widely used as a buffering agent and emulsifying salt in items like creamers, processed cheeses, and drink mixes. You’ll see it on labels as dipotassium phosphate or “potassium phosphate (dibasic).”

## At a glance
Dipotassium phosphate is a simple potassium salt of phosphoric acid used to control acidity, stabilize texture, and support emulsions.

- E-number: E340ii; also called potassium phosphate, dibasic
- Roles: buffering agent, stabilizer, emulsifying salt, sequestrant
- Common in: shelf-stable creamers, processed cheese products, powdered beverages
- Nutrient note: provides potassium and phosphorus in small amounts
- Regulatory view: permitted in the U.S. and EU when used as intended

## Why is Dipotassium phosphate added to food?
Manufacturers use dipotassium phosphate mainly to keep the pH (acidity) steady, prevent proteins from clumping, and help fat and water mix smoothly. In processed cheese, it acts as an “emulsifying salt,” improving melt and sliceability; in creamers and ready-to-drink coffees, it helps keep dairy proteins from curdling in hot, acidic coffee. In powders and mixes, it can also support flow and stability over shelf life.[^3]

## What foods contain Dipotassium phosphate?
You’re most likely to find it in:
- Shelf-stable and refrigerated coffee creamers (dairy and non-dairy)
- Processed and analog cheeses, cheese sauces, and spreads
- Powdered drink mixes and instant beverages
- Ready-to-drink coffees and teas
- Plant-based milks and protein shakes
- Bakery mixes, soups, and sauces

Regulators list potassium phosphates among permitted additives, so you’ll encounter them across many processed foods; always check the ingredient list for “dipotassium phosphate” or “potassium phosphate (dibasic).”[^5]

## What can replace Dipotassium phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- Buffering and acidity control: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates), or [monopotassium phosphate](/e340i-monopotassium-phosphate)
- Emulsifying salts in cheese: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or [trisodium phosphate](/e339iii-trisodium-phosphate) (note sodium content)
- Leavening/alkalinity tweaks: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) or [potassium hydrogen carbonate](/e501ii-potassium-hydrogen-carbonate)

Formulations are sensitive, so swaps are not one-for-one; the right choice depends on pH target, flavor, sodium/potassium goals, and texture.

## How is Dipotassium phosphate made?
Food-grade dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) is typically produced by neutralizing purified phosphoric acid with a potassium base such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate, followed by crystallization and drying. Products must meet identity and purity specifications set in food-additive regulations.[^1][^3]

## Is Dipotassium phosphate safe to eat?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms potassium phosphate, dibasic, as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with current good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated phosphate additives as a group and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day (from all phosphate additives, not just this one).[^2]

## Does Dipotassium phosphate have any benefits?
- Functional: It stabilizes pH and improves texture and emulsion stability, which keeps foods consistent from batch to batch.  
- Nutritional: It supplies small amounts of potassium and phosphorus—both essential nutrients. Potassium supports normal fluid balance and nerve and muscle function,[^7] while phosphorus is vital for bones, teeth, and energy metabolism.[^6]

Because serving sizes and use levels are low, it’s not usually a major source of these nutrients in typical diets.

## Who should avoid Dipotassium phosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease or those advised to limit phosphorus may need to avoid phosphate additives to reduce the risk of high blood phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia).[^4]
- Individuals who must restrict potassium (for example, due to impaired kidney function or certain medications) should monitor intake from potassium-containing additives, including dipotassium phosphate.[^7]
- EFSA noted that some children with high consumption of phosphate-containing foods could exceed the group ADI for phosphate additives; prudent use and balanced diets help manage exposure.[^2]

If you have kidney, heart, or endocrine conditions, follow your clinician’s guidance on phosphate and potassium.

## Myths & facts
- “Phosphates are just harsh chemicals.” Phosphates occur naturally in foods and the body; as additives, they’re purified salts used in tiny amounts for predictable food quality.  
- “If it’s GRAS, I can eat unlimited amounts.” GRAS status and EFSA’s ADI both assume use within good manufacturing practice and balanced diets; more is not always better.[^2]  
- “All creamers or cheeses use the same phosphate.” Different products may use potassium or sodium phosphate salts, or citrate-based systems, depending on pH, taste, and nutrition goals.

## Dipotassium phosphate in branded foods
You’ll often see dipotassium phosphate on ingredient lists for shelf-stable coffee creamers, certain ready-to-drink coffees, some plant-based milks, and processed cheese slices or sauces. Label wording varies—look for “dipotassium phosphate,” “potassium phosphate (dibasic),” or “K2HPO4.” Availability and recipes change, so the surest way to confirm is to read the current package label or the manufacturer’s product page.
