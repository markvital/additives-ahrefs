      "q": "why is lanolin bad for skin",
      "a": "It isn’t inherently bad—lanolin is a strong occlusive moisturizer—but a small number of people develop contact allergy (often to wool alcohols) or find it too heavy and pore‑clogging. Highly purified/medical‑grade lanolin lowers the risk of irritation.",

      "q": "is lanolin safe for baby",
      "a": "Medical‑grade lanolin used on nipples for breastfeeding is generally considered safe for infants to ingest in trace amounts, but avoid if there’s a known wool/lanolin allergy. As a food additive (E913), permitted uses lead to very low exposure and are considered safe by regulators.",
