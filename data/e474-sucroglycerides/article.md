Sucroglycerides (E474) are food emulsifiers made from sucrose and edible fats or oils. They help oil and water mix smoothly, improving texture and stability in many everyday foods. In the European Union, E474 is an approved additive.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of what E474 does and where you might see it.

- What it is: An emulsifier made from sucrose and edible fats/oils
- E‑number: E474
- What it does: Keeps oil and water mixed; improves texture and stability
- Where it’s used: Baked goods, desserts, spreads, sauces, dressings, non‑dairy creamers, and confectionery
- On the label: “Sucroglycerides” or “E474”
- Heat and pH: Works across typical cooking and processing conditions
- Dietary notes: Commonly sourced from vegetable oils; check with the manufacturer if you avoid animal‑derived ingredients
- Regulation: Authorized as a food additive in the EU

## Why is Sucroglycerides added to food?
Food makers add sucroglycerides to help oil and water stay mixed so products do not separate. This improves smoothness in sauces and dressings, stabilizes foams and whipped textures, and keeps baked goods tender and evenly risen. In the EU, E474 is listed as an authorized emulsifier in the Union list of food additives.[^1]

## What foods contain Sucroglycerides?
You’re most likely to find E474 in foods that need stable oil‑in‑water mixtures or a fine, even crumb.
- Cakes, muffins, and sponge mixes
- Biscuits and cookies
- Whipped toppings and non‑dairy creamers
- Chocolate compounds and confectionery fillings
- Spreads and margarines
- Sauces, gravies, and salad dressings
- Frozen desserts and ice creams

It may appear together with other emulsifiers to fine‑tune texture and stability.

## What can replace Sucroglycerides?
Several emulsifiers can serve similar roles, depending on the recipe:
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) (E471)
- [Sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids) (E473)
- [Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids) (E475)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (E322), often from soy or sunflower
- For beverage emulsions, [sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate) (E444) can help keep flavors evenly dispersed

The best substitute depends on the food’s fat content, pH, processing steps, and labeling needs.

## How is Sucroglycerides made?
Sucroglycerides are produced by reacting sucrose with edible fats or oils (such as those from vegetable or other edible sources) in a controlled process called transesterification. The result is a defined mixture of sucrose fatty‑acid esters together with mono‑ and diglycerides; the product is then purified to meet strict identity and purity limits set in EU specifications.[^2]

## Is Sucroglycerides safe to eat?
In the EU, a food additive can only be used if it is included on the Union list, which requires a prior safety evaluation, technological need, and consumer protection considerations.[^1] For E474, detailed identity and purity criteria also apply, including limits on contaminants and by‑products, as laid out in the additive specifications.[^2]

When used as authorized, sucroglycerides are considered safe in foods. Regulatory reviews focus on how the additive is used, how much people are likely to eat, and its composition and quality controls.[^1]

## Does Sucroglycerides have any benefits?
Beyond keeping oil and water mixed, sucroglycerides can:
- Improve volume and crumb softness in cakes
- Help whipped toppings hold air for longer
- Reduce fat separation in spreads and sauces
- Support smooth, uniform textures in confectionery and ice creams

These benefits help products stay consistent from the factory to your kitchen.

## Who should avoid Sucroglycerides?
Most people do not need to avoid E474. However:
- Source of fats: Sucroglycerides are made from edible fats and oils, and the exact source can vary by supplier. If you avoid animal‑derived ingredients for vegetarian, vegan, halal, or kosher reasons, check with the manufacturer.
- Allergies: The additive is highly refined and contains fats and sugars rather than proteins, so allergen carry‑over is unlikely. If you have severe allergies, confirm with the brand or supplier.

## Myths & facts
Here are a few common points, clarified.
- Myth: “Sucroglycerides are just sugar added to food.” Fact: They are emulsifiers made from sucrose and fats; they are used for texture and stability, not sweetness.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: E474 is an emulsifier. It does not act as an antimicrobial preservative.
- Myth: “Additives like E474 are not reviewed.” Fact: In the EU, additives must be evaluated and authorized before use, and must meet strict specifications.[^1][^2]

## Sucroglycerides in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sucroglycerides” or the short name “E474,” often grouped under the emulsifiers line. EU labeling rules allow additives to be listed by category name (for example, “emulsifier”) followed by the specific name or E‑number.[^3] You’ll most often see it in cakes, toppings, spreads, sauces, and confectionery where smooth, stable textures matter.
