Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propane-1 (E478) are emulsifiers that help fat and water mix and stay mixed. They are used in bakery, creams, and other foods to improve texture, volume, and stability during storage and heating. They are a group of related compounds made from edible fats, [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), and small amounts of [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol).

## At a glance
- What it is: A blend of lactylated esters made from edible fats, glycerol, and a little propylene glycol; used as an emulsifier and texture aid.
- What it does: Improves mixing of oil and water, stabilizes foams and emulsions, and helps baked goods keep a soft crumb.
- Where it’s used: Bakery products, whipped toppings, cream analogues, spreads, and similar emulsified foods.
- Dietary notes: Lactic acid in food additives is typically made by fermenting sugars, not from milk; fatty acids may come from plant or animal fats.

## Why is E478 added to food?
Food makers use E478 to create and stabilize emulsions and foams. In doughs and batters, it helps trap air and hold water, which can improve rise, crumb softness, and sliceability. In creams and toppings, it helps fat droplets stay evenly dispersed so the product whips well and resists weeping under heat and storage.

## What foods contain E478?
E478 is authorized in the European Union as an emulsifier for specific food categories and at set maximum levels, so you’ll most often find it in products that need reliable emulsification or aeration. Typical examples include:
- Bread, buns, cakes, and other fine bakery wares
- Whipped toppings and dessert foams
- Cream analogues and coffee whiteners
- Fat spreads and certain confectionery fillings

Exact permissions and limits are listed in the EU food additives regulation for authorized uses.[^2]

## What can replace E478?
Depending on the recipe and processing, formulators may switch to:
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate)

Each alternative behaves a bit differently, so choices depend on the food, processing steps, and label goals.

## How is E478 made?
E478 is produced from edible fats and oils by forming esters with [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) and small amounts of [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol). These esters are then “lactylated” by reacting them with [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) or its small polymers. The result is a defined mixture of lactylated esters that meet identity and purity specifications set in EU law.[^1]

## Is E478 safe to eat?
Within the European Union, E478 is authorized for use in specific foods and must meet detailed composition and purity specifications. Authorization means risk assessors and regulators found it acceptable at the permitted levels when used as intended.[^2] Manufacturers must also ensure the additive meets the official specification for identity and contaminants before it goes into food.[^1]

## Does E478 have any benefits?
Yes. In practical use, E478 can:
- Improve loaf volume and crumb softness in bakery items
- Help whipped toppings hold their shape
- Stabilize emulsions so products tolerate heating, pumping, and storage without separating

These are common functional roles for emulsifiers in modern food processing.

## Who should avoid E478?
- People following vegan, vegetarian, kosher, or halal diets may wish to verify the source of the fatty acids (they can be from plant or animal fats; suppliers can provide documentation).[^1]
- Those with milk allergy usually do not need to avoid E478 because the lactic acid used in food manufacturing is typically produced by fermenting sugars, not milk.[^3]

If you have a specific medical restriction related to propylene glycol or fats, discuss ingredient choices with a qualified professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Lactic” means it contains lactose or milk.  
  Fact: Food-grade lactic acid is generally made by fermenting carbohydrates and does not contain milk proteins or lactose.[^3]
- Myth: Emulsifiers always make food “ultra-processed.”  
  Fact: Emulsifiers like E478 are tools; they can appear in both simple and complex foods. The overall recipe matters more than any one ingredient.
- Myth: E-numbers are chemicals not allowed outside the EU.  
  Fact: E-numbers are simply EU codes. Many of the same substances are used globally under different naming systems.

## E478 in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E478,” “lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propane-1,2-diol,” or similar wording like “lactylated glycerides and propylene glycol esters.” Placement is usually alongside other emulsifiers.
