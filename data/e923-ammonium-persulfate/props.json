  "description": "Ammonium persulfate -APS- is the inorganic compound with the formula -NH4-2S2O8.  It is a colourless -white- salt that is highly soluble in water, much more so than the related potassium salt. It is a strong oxidizing agent that is used in polymer chemistry, as an etchant, and as a cleaning and bleaching agent. The dissolution of the salt in water is an endothermic process.",
