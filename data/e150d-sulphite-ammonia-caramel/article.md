Sulphite ammonia caramel (E150d) is a dark brown food color made by heating sugars with ammonium and sulfite compounds. Also called acid‑proof or soft‑drink caramel, it gives the deep cola‑brown shade that stays stable in acidic drinks. It is regulated in both the US and EU, with specification limits to control impurities such as 4‑MEI (4‑methylimidazole).

## At a glance
- What it is: Caramel colour, Class IV; a complex brown mixture made from heated sugars with ammonium and sulfite compounds
- What it does: Colours foods and drinks a deep, stable brown; especially suited to acidic products
- Also called: acid‑proof caramel, soft‑drink caramel, Colour E150d
- Typical uses: Colas and other soft drinks, ready‑to‑drink teas, sauces, bakery fillings
- Charge type: Negatively charged caramel, useful for acid and protein systems
- Label names: “Caramel color,” “E150d,” or “Sulphite ammonia caramel”
- Vegan/vegetarian: Typically made from plant sugars; not derived from animal ingredients
- Allergen note: Made with sulfite compounds; people sensitive to sulfites should check with their healthcare provider

## Why is Sulphite ammonia caramel added to food?
Food makers use E150d to create a consistent, appetizing brown color and to keep that color stable in acidic conditions. It disperses well, resists fading in sodas and acidic sauces, and helps products look the same from batch to batch. Class IV caramel is often chosen for colas and other drinks that are acidified, because it remains “acid‑proof” and does not haze.

## What foods contain Sulphite ammonia caramel?
You’ll most often find E150d in:
- Soft drinks and mixers, especially colas and energy drinks
- Ready‑to‑drink teas and coffees
- Brown sauces, gravies, and marinades
- Balsamic‑style vinegars and condiments
- Baked goods, dessert toppings, and cereal coatings

Because it is stable in acidic formulas, it is a common choice in beverages containing acids such as [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid) or citric acid.

## What can replace Sulphite ammonia caramel?
The best substitute depends on the product and the acidity:
- Other caramel colours:
  - [Plain caramel (E150a)](/e150a-plain-caramel) for mild, neutral systems
  - [Caustic sulphite caramel (E150b)](/e150b-caustic-sulphite-caramel) for certain low‑acid applications
  - [Ammonia caramel (E150c)](/e150c-ammonia-caramel) where a different charge behavior is needed
- Non‑caramel options for darker tones: [vegetable carbon (E153)](/e153-vegetable-carbon) for black/very dark hues
- Food ingredients (not additives): small amounts of cocoa, coffee, or malt extract can add brown tones but won’t match E150d’s stability and label simplicity

## How is Sulphite ammonia caramel made?
Manufacturers heat carbohydrates (such as glucose syrup, sucrose, or invert sugar) under controlled conditions in the presence of ammonium and sulfite compounds. This “caramelization” produces a complex mixture of brown polymers with strong coloring power. In the US, caramel is a permitted color additive made by heating sugars with or without reactants such as ammonium or sulfite salts, under good manufacturing practice.[^1] The EU has detailed specifications for E150d that list permitted starting materials and set purity criteria for process‑related substances and impurities, including 4‑MEI and sulfites.[^2]

## Is Sulphite ammonia caramel safe to eat?
Regulators in both the US and EU allow caramel colours in food within established specifications and good manufacturing practice.[^1][^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated caramel colours (E 150a‑d) and concluded that exposure from their approved uses does not raise safety concerns; EFSA also established acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) for the different classes and considered 4‑MEI from Class III and IV within specifications not to pose a health concern at typical dietary exposures.[^3] EU specifications additionally set limits for certain process‑related substances (such as 4‑MEI) and sulfite residues, adding a further safety margin.[^2]

## Does Sulphite ammonia caramel have any benefits?
Beyond creating an appealing brown shade, E150d:
- Keeps color uniform in acidic, carbonated drinks
- Helps mask natural color variations in multi‑ingredient foods
- Offers good solubility and process tolerance, simplifying large‑scale production

## Who should avoid Sulphite ammonia caramel?
- People with sulfite sensitivity or certain forms of asthma may wish to discuss E150d with a healthcare provider. It is manufactured using sulfite compounds, and while residual sulfite is controlled by specifications, sensitive individuals may prefer to avoid products listing “caramel color (E150d).”
- Those following special diets (e.g., low‑sodium or low‑potassium) rarely need to avoid this color, as it contributes negligible minerals at normal use levels.

If you’re concerned, check labels for “caramel color,” “E150d,” or “Sulphite ammonia caramel.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All caramel color is the same.”  
  Fact: There are four classes (E150a–d). E150d is made with both ammonium and sulfite compounds and is chosen for acid stability; other classes differ in process and properties.[^3]
- Myth: “Caramel color in colas is unstable in acid.”  
  Fact: Class IV caramel is specifically valued for acid stability in soft drinks.
- Myth: “Caramel color isn’t regulated.”  
  Fact: It is a regulated color additive in the US and EU with manufacturing and purity specifications.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “E150d always contains high 4‑MEI.”  
  Fact: EU specifications include limits for 4‑MEI, and EFSA found typical dietary exposure to 4‑MEI from caramel colors does not raise safety concerns.[^2][^3]

## Sulphite ammonia caramel in branded foods
You’ll commonly see E150d on ingredient lists for colas and other brown soft drinks, some ready‑to‑drink teas, and brown sauces. On labels it may appear as “caramel color,” “E150d,” or “Sulphite ammonia caramel.” Because formulations change, the surest way to know is to check the ingredient list on the package.
