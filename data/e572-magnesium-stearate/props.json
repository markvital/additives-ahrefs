  "description": "Magnesium stearate is the chemical compound with the formula Mg-C18H35O2-2. It is a soap, consisting of salt containing two equivalents of stearate -the anion of stearic acid- and one magnesium cation -Mg2+-.  Magnesium stearate is a white, water-insoluble powder. Its applications exploit its softness, insolubility in many solvents, and low toxicity. It is used as a release agent and as a component or lubricant in the production of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.",
