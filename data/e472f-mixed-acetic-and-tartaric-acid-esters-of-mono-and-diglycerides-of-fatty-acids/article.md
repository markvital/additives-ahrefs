E472F is a group of emulsifiers made by attaching small amounts of acetic acid and tartaric acid to mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids. Food makers use it to help oil and water mix, to stabilize foams, and to improve the texture of baked goods and creams. It is authorized for use in the European Union with defined purity rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier made from [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) reacted with small amounts of [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) and [L‑tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid).
- What it does: helps water and oil mix, stabilizes foams, and supports soft, even textures in doughs, creams, and sauces.
- Where you’ll find it: breads and rolls, fine bakery wares, dessert toppings and fillings, non‑dairy creamers, and emulsified sauces.
- Label names: “E472f,” “emulsifier,” or “mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono‑ and diglycerides of fatty acids.”
- Diet notes: can be made from plant or animal fats; vegans and vegetarians may want to check the source with the manufacturer.

## Why is E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Manufacturers add E472F to keep oil and water from separating, to stabilize whipped or aerated textures, and to give doughs and batters a finer crumb and better volume. In short, it acts as an emulsifier and stabilizer that makes products look and feel consistent from batch to batch.[^1]

## What foods contain E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
E472F is permitted in a wide range of foods in the EU. You’ll most often see it in:
- Bread, buns, and fine bakery wares
- Cake mixes, fillings, and whipped toppings
- Non‑dairy creamers and beverage whiteners
- Emulsified sauces and dressings

Look for “E472f” or “emulsifier” in the ingredient list.[^1]

## What can replace E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- Other E472 emulsifiers, such as [acetic acid esters](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [tartaric acid esters](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [mono‑ and diacetyl tartaric acid esters (DATEM)](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) from soy or sunflower
- Lactylates such as [sodium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Hydrocolloids that aid stability, like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- In some systems, [citric acid esters of mono‑ and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)

## How is E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
Producers start with mono‑ and diglycerides of edible fatty acids, typically derived from vegetable or animal fats and oils. They then react them with [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) and food‑grade [L‑tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) (or their anhydrides) so that some of the free hydroxyl groups on the glyceride backbone become “esterified” with acetic and tartaric acid groups. The EU specification defines the identity and purity of the resulting mixture of partial esters.[^2]

## Is E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
In the European Union, E472F is authorized as a food additive and must meet detailed purity criteria. Its authorization reflects a safety assessment and continued regulatory oversight. When used within the legal limits and good manufacturing practice, it is considered acceptable for consumption.[^1][^2]

## Does E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
For makers and bakers, yes. E472F:
- Helps form stable emulsions and foams, which improves volume and uniformity in baked and aerated products
- Supports softer crumb structure and slows quality loss caused by staling in some baked goods
- Improves the dispersion of fats and flavors in creams and sauces

These are technological, not nutritional, benefits.

## Who should avoid E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
- Vegans, vegetarians, kosher, and halal consumers: mono‑ and diglycerides can be made from either plant or animal fats. E472F inherits that variability; check for “vegetable origin” claims or ask the manufacturer.[^2]
- People with specific medical advice to limit emulsifiers should follow their healthcare provider’s guidance.
- There are no common allergy warnings linked to E472F, and it is used at low levels in foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E472F is a single chemical.” Fact: It is a defined mixture of related esters made by the same process.
- Myth: “It adds vinegar or tart flavors.” Fact: The acetic and tartaric acid parts are bound as esters and do not act like free acids in taste at typical use levels.
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are artificial.” Fact: E‑numbers simply mean the additive is authorized in the EU with a safety and purity standard.
- Myth: “It’s always plant‑based.” Fact: The fat source can be plant or animal unless the label or maker states otherwise.

## E472F — Mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On European labels, you may see “E472f” or “emulsifier (E472f)” in:
- Sliced sandwich bread, brioche, wraps, and buns
- Ready‑to‑whip toppings and pastry creams
- Non‑dairy creamers and beverage whiteners
- Emulsified sauces and dressings

Ingredient lists sometimes group emulsifiers together, so E472F may appear alongside [E471](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [E472a](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [E472e](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).
