Rice bran wax (E908) is a hard, plant‑based wax taken from rice bran oil. Food makers use it in tiny amounts to give candies and fruits a smooth, glossy coating and to keep sticky foods from clumping.

## At a glance
- What it is: A purified wax made from rice bran oil, used as a glazing and anti‑stick agent.
- What it does: Adds shine, protects surfaces, and helps coatings set firmly on foods.
- Where it’s used: Common in confectionery coatings, chewing gum, and some fresh produce.
- Regulation: Listed in the European Union with the number E908 for specific food uses.
- Safety: Reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which did not identify safety concerns at reported uses.

## Why is Rice bran wax added to food?
Rice bran wax gives a smooth, glossy finish and forms a thin protective layer that reduces stickiness. Its relatively high melting range helps it stay solid at room temperature, so it holds a polish and resists smearing on warm handling surfaces.[^1]

## What foods contain Rice bran wax?
You’ll most often find Rice bran wax as a “glazing agent” or “polish” on:
- Sugar‑coated and panned candies
- Chewing gum and some chocolate‑coated nuts
- Certain fresh fruits that are sold with an edible polish

In the European Union, it is authorised as a food additive (E908) for specific uses set out in the food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Rice bran wax?
Depending on the recipe and label needs, makers may switch to:
- [Carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) for a hard, high‑gloss finish
- [Candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) for a plant‑based polish with a slightly lower melt
- [White and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) for a softer, natural wax
- [Shellac](/e904-shellac) for high gloss on confectionery and fruit
- Petroleum‑derived options like [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax) or [petroleum wax](/e905cii-paraffin-wax) when permitted

## How is Rice bran wax made?
Rice bran wax is obtained during the dewaxing (winterisation) step of producing rice bran oil from Oryza sativa (rice). The crude wax is then purified to meet food‑grade specifications, including a defined melting range and limits for impurities.[^1]

## Is Rice bran wax safe to eat?
EFSA re‑evaluated Rice bran wax (E908) as part of its ongoing review of food additives and did not identify safety concerns at the reported uses and use levels in food.[^3] In the EU, its use is regulated by law, which sets where it can be used and under what conditions.[^2]

ADI explained: An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is the amount of a substance that can be eaten daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. EFSA did not establish safety concerns for Rice bran wax at reported uses, so a numerical ADI was not considered necessary in that evaluation.[^3]

## Does Rice bran wax have any benefits?
For food makers, it:
- Improves shine and appearance on candies and fruit
- Reduces sticking during processing and shipping
- Helps coatings set with a firm, clean bite

For shoppers, it can help coated products look uniform and stay less sticky in the package.

## Who should avoid Rice bran wax?
- People advised by a clinician to avoid glazing agents or waxes for personal dietary reasons
- Anyone who notices a sensitivity to wax‑coated foods (rare) can choose alternatives by checking labels

If you have a specific allergy or medical condition, follow your healthcare professional’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Rice bran wax is the same as paraffin wax.
  - Fact: It is a plant‑derived wax from rice bran oil, not a petroleum product.
- Myth: It adds a lot of calories.
  - Fact: It is used in very small amounts as a surface treatment.
- Myth: All shiny fruit is coated with Rice bran wax.
  - Fact: Different waxes or shellac may be used, and some fruit is sold without any coating.
- Myth: “E‑numbers” mean artificial chemicals.
  - Fact: An E‑number means the additive is authorised in the EU; many are natural or plant‑derived.

## Rice bran wax in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “rice bran wax” or “E908.” You’ll most often see it on polished candies, chewing gum, and some waxed fruits. It may also appear in fine print as part of a “glazing agents” blend.
