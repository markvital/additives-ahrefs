Acetic acid (E260) is a preservative and flavoring that gives vinegar its sharp taste. It helps control pH and slows the growth of many microbes. Look for “acetic acid” or “vinegar” on ingredient lists for pickled foods, dressings, and sauces.

## At a glance
- Also called / E-number: Acetic acid; ethanoic acid; E260 (E-numbers are EU codes; U.S. labels use ingredient names)
- What it does: Preservative, acidifier, and flavoring; helps control microbes and browning
- Common in: Pickles, relishes, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressings, hot sauces, BBQ sauces, marinades, “salt & vinegar” snacks, some canned vegetables
- Diet flags: Vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, keto-friendly in small amounts; typically halal- and kosher-suitable. Check labels for added flavors or alcohol-based carriers if needed.

## 1) Why it’s added to food
- It preserves foods by lowering pH. Many spoilage microbes do not grow well in acidic conditions.  
- It adds a sour, tangy flavor. It also helps control enzyme activity and browning in some foods.  
- Shopping tip: If you want longer shelf life without heat canning, look for pickled products with vinegar or acetic acid on the label.

## 2) What foods it’s found in
- Vinegar and pickled vegetables (cucumbers, peppers, beets, relishes).  
- Condiments and sauces: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressings, hot sauces, BBQ sauces, marinades.  
- Snacks and prepared foods: “salt & vinegar” chips, some canned vegetables, some salsas and chutneys.  
- Shopping tip: Check labels for “acetic acid,” “vinegar,” “distilled white vinegar,” or “apple cider vinegar.”

## 3) What are its alternatives
- Other food acids: citric acid (from citrus), lactic acid (from fermentation), malic acid (from apples), and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for browning control.  
- Natural sources: lemon or lime juice in home cooking.  
- Shopping tip: If you want milder sourness, choose products acidified with citric or lactic acid. If you avoid vinegar flavor, pick “no vinegar” or “citrus-based” dressings.

## 4) How acetic acid is manufactured
- Fermentation (food-traditional): Acetic acid bacteria (such as Acetobacter) oxidize ethanol from wine, cider, or grain alcohol to make vinegar (usually 4–8% acetic acid).  
- Industrial (food-grade): High-purity acetic acid can also be made by carbonylation of methanol, then diluted and purified for food use.  
- Shopping tip: “Vinegar” on the label comes from fermentation. “Acetic acid” may be fermentation- or synthetically sourced; both must meet food-grade standards.

## 5) How safe is acetic acid for consumption?
- In the U.S., food-grade acetic acid is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.  
- The EU re-evaluated acetic acid and acetates (E260–E263) and found no safety concern at reported uses and levels; acceptable daily intake (ADI) “not specified.”

## 6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Vinegar (acetic acid in water) helps preserve foods by reducing microbial growth in acidic recipes (like pickles).  
- Some studies link vinegar with small, short-term reductions in post-meal blood glucose. Results vary and it is not a treatment.  
- Shopping tip: Choose tested pickling recipes and proper acidity; do not rely on vinegar to make unsafe foods safe.

## 7) When acetic acid may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Undiluted or very strong acetic acid can irritate the mouth, throat, or stomach. People with reflux or sensitive teeth may find acidic foods uncomfortable.  
- Rare sensitivity is possible. Stop using if you notice irritation.  
- Keep strong vinegar or concentrated acetic acid away from children. Do not drink concentrated acids.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Acetic acid from synthesis is unsafe; only vinegar is safe.”  
  Fact: Food-grade acetic acid, whether from fermentation or synthesis, must meet purity standards and is GRAS when used as intended.

- Myth: “Vinegar kills all harmful germs in food.”  
  Fact: Vinegar reduces many microbes but does not destroy all pathogens or spores. Safe canning needs tested recipes and proper acidity.

- Myth: “E-numbers are not allowed in the U.S.”  
  Fact: E-numbers are EU codes. In the U.S., labels use ingredient names like “acetic acid” or “vinegar,” and acetic acid is permitted.

## Acetic acid in Branded Foods
You’ll find acetic acid or vinegar in many branded pickles, condiments, salad dressings, marinades, hot sauces, and “salt & vinegar” snacks. It is common across national and store brands.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is E260 the same as vinegar?  
  E260 is the code for acetic acid, the main acid in vinegar. Vinegar is typically 4–8% acetic acid in water plus flavor compounds.
- Is acetic acid allowed in the U.S.?  
  Yes. It is GRAS when used as intended. U.S. labels list “acetic acid” or “vinegar,” not the E-number.
- Is acetic acid vegan and gluten-free?  
  Yes. It is not from animal gluten sources. Check for added flavors or carriers if you have strict dietary needs.
- Can acetic acid cause heartburn?  
  Acidic foods can trigger symptoms in some people. If you have reflux, choose milder products or lower-acid alternatives.
- How will it appear on labels?  
  Look for “acetic acid,” “vinegar,” “distilled white vinegar,” or “apple cider vinegar.” In the EU you may also see “E260.”
