Disodium citrate (E331ii) is a sodium salt of citric acid used to control acidity and keep foods stable. It acts as a buffer and metal-binding agent, helping drinks taste balanced and cheese melt smoothly. You’ll see it in beverages, dairy-style products, and processed foods.

## At a glance
- What it does: acidity regulator (buffer), sequestrant (binds metal ions), stabiliser, and sometimes emulsifier.
- Where it shows up: soft drinks and powdered mixes, processed cheese and cheese sauces, jams and jellies, canned fruits, and cured or brined meats.
- Taste and texture: gently tart and slightly salty; smooths sharp sourness and improves melt in cheese.
- Diet notes: vegan-friendly, gluten-free, and not a common allergen; does add some sodium.
- On labels: may appear as “disodium citrate,” “E331ii,” or “sodium citrates (E331).”
- Kitchen performance: heat-stable and effective across typical food acidity levels.

## Why is Disodium citrate added to food?
Food makers use disodium citrate to keep pH (acidity level) steady, which protects flavor, color, and texture. It also binds trace metals such as iron and copper; this slows down off-flavors and browning in foods and drinks.[^2] In processed cheese, it helps proteins and fat stay mixed so the cheese melts evenly without oiling off.[^2]

## What foods contain Disodium citrate?
Disodium citrate appears in many categories: flavored drinks and drink mixes, dairy analogues and processed cheeses, jams and jellies, canned fruits, confectionery, and some cured or brined meats.[^2] In the European Union (EU), the additive number E 331 covers a family of sodium citrates—mono-, di-, and tri-sodium salts—which may be listed as E331(i–iii) on labels.[^4] You may also see the broader term “[sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)” on ingredient lists.

## What can replace Disodium citrate?
- To sharpen or buffer acidity: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) (more sour), [monosodium citrate](/e331i-monosodium-citrate) or [trisodium citrate](/e331iii-trisodium-citrate) (different buffering ranges), or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates) when reducing sodium is a goal.
- For melt/texture in processed cheese: citrates often swap with certain [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates), depending on the recipe.
- For acidity control in sodas: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid) is another common acidulant; buffering can be adjusted with alkaline salts such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) in specific formulations.

The best substitute depends on the target pH, flavor, sodium limits, and the product’s texture needs.

## How is Disodium citrate made?
Disodium citrate is produced by partially neutralizing [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with a sodium base (commonly sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate), followed by crystallization and drying to obtain the di-sodium salt.[^1] In the EU, quality and purity must meet the official additive specifications for sodium citrates (E 331).[^4]

## Is Disodium citrate safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated citric acid and its sodium salts (E 330–E 331) and found no safety concern at reported uses and levels; an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium citrate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use in food under good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Does Disodium citrate have any benefits?
For consumers, it helps foods taste consistent and prevents unwanted changes during shelf life. In cheese, it supports a smoother, more uniform melt. In drinks, it softens harsh sourness and keeps flavor stable over time.

## Who should avoid Disodium citrate?
- People limiting sodium for health reasons may wish to watch total sodium from all sources, including salts like disodium citrate.
- Individuals with a physician‑directed low‑sodium diet should check labels and serving sizes.
- Very sensitive individuals who react to acidic foods may choose alternatives, though such reactions are uncommon.

If you have a medical condition, follow your clinician’s advice on sodium and acidulants.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s a harsh chemical preservative.” Fact: Disodium citrate mainly regulates acidity and binds metals; it is not a classic antimicrobial preservative.
- Myth: “All citrates taste very sour.” Fact: Disodium citrate is less sour than citric acid and often used to smooth, not spike, acidity.
- Myth: “Citrates always mean high sodium.” Fact: Levels vary by product and serving; some formulas use potassium or calcium citrates instead.

## Disodium citrate in branded foods
You’ll often find disodium citrate or “sodium citrates (E331)” on labels of:
- Processed cheese slices and cheese sauces
- Powdered lemonades and isotonic drink mixes
- Jams, jellies, and canned fruit in syrup
- Brined or cured meats and some deli products

Availability and usage vary by country and brand. Check the ingredient list for “disodium citrate,” “E331ii,” or “sodium citrates (E331).”
