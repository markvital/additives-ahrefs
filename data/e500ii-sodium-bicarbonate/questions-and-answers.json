      "q": "what does baking soda do",
      "a": "It’s a leavening agent (sodium bicarbonate) that releases carbon dioxide when it reacts with acids, helping batters and doughs rise. It also raises pH, which can enhance browning and mellow acidity.",

      "q": "what's the difference between baking soda and baking powder",
      "a": "Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate and needs an added acid to work; baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate plus acidic salts and usually starch. Most baking powders are double-acting, releasing gas when wet and again when heated.",

      "q": "can i use baking soda instead of baking powder",
      "a": "Yes—if you add an acid: for each 1 tsp baking powder, use about 1/4 tsp baking soda plus 1/2 tsp cream of tartar (or an equivalent acidic ingredient like lemon juice, yogurt, or buttermilk). Adjust liquids if using acidic liquids so the batter isn’t too wet.",

      "q": "does baking soda go bad",
      "a": "It doesn’t spoil, but it can lose leavening power after opening, especially if exposed to moisture or odors. For baking, replace about every 6 months after opening or test by adding some to vinegar/hot water—vigorous fizz means it’s still active.",

    {
      "q": "can i use baking powder instead of baking soda",
      "a": "Often, yes: use roughly 3 times as much baking powder as baking soda (1 tsp soda ≈ 3 tsp powder). Because powder already includes acid and starch, reduce other acidic ingredients if needed, and expect slight changes in flavor or texture.",
