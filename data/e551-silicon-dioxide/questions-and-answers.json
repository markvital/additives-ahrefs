      "q": "is silicon dioxide safe",
      "a": "Yes—food-grade silicon dioxide (E551), a synthetic amorphous silica used as an anti-caking agent, is permitted by regulators (e.g., FDA GRAS; EFSA found no concern at current uses) at typical food levels. This differs from inhaling crystalline silica dust, which is hazardous.",

    {
      "q": "what happens if you eat silica gel",
      "a": "Silica gel is an inert, amorphous silicon dioxide desiccant; if swallowed it usually passes through without being absorbed, though it can cause brief stomach upset or pose a choking risk. Indicator varieties (e.g., cobalt-dyed) aren’t meant to be eaten—seek advice if a child swallows a packet or a large amount.",

    {
      "q": "is silicon dioxide bad for you",
      "a": "Not at the small amounts used in foods—E551 is considered safe and is largely not absorbed by the body. The main risk with silica is from inhaling crystalline silica dust, not ingesting food-grade amorphous silica.",

    {
      "q": "is silica bad for you",
      "a": "In foods, amorphous silica (E551) used as an anti-caking agent is regarded as safe at permitted levels, and most ingested is excreted. Health concerns mainly relate to occupational inhalation of crystalline silica, which is hazardous.",

    {
      "q": "what is silica gel",
      "a": "Silica gel is a porous, amorphous form of silicon dioxide used as a desiccant to control moisture in packaging. It isn’t a food ingredient, and “Do not eat” labels are to prevent choking or misuse.",
