  "description": "Gellan gum is a water-soluble anionic polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Sphingomonas elodea -formerly Pseudomonas elodea based on the taxonomic classification at the time of its discovery-.  Its taxonomic classification has been subsequently changed to Sphingomonas elodea based on current classification system. The gellan-producing bacterium was discovered and isolated by the former Kelco Division of Merck & Company, Inc. in 1978 from the lily plant tissue from a natural pond in Pennsylvania, USA. It was initially identified as a substitute gelling agent at significantly lower use level to replace agar in solid culture media for the growth of various microorganisms  Its initial commercial product with the trademark as \"GELRITE\" gellan gum, was subsequently identified as a suitable agar substitute as gelling agent in various clinical bacteriological media.",
