      "q": "how to make buffered vinegar",
      "a": "Buffered vinegar is made by partially neutralizing vinegar (acetic acid) with a food‑grade base (commonly sodium or potassium bicarbonate/carbonate or hydroxide) while monitoring pH, typically stopping around pH 5–7 to retain antimicrobial acetate with less sourness. Add the base slowly (carbonates will release CO2 and foam), use a calibrated pH meter and food‑grade materials, and follow local regulations if producing it for sale.",
