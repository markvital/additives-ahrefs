Ammonium stearate (E571) is the ammonium salt of stearic acid, a long‑chain fatty acid found naturally in many foods. In food processing it is used in small amounts, mainly to help mix oil and water (as an emulsifier) or to keep powders free‑flowing.

## At a glance
- What it is: the ammonium salt of stearic acid (a common dietary fatty acid)
- What it does: works as an emulsifier, anti‑caking agent, and release agent
- Where you might see it: select powdered mixes, coatings, or processing aids
- Also known as: E571, ammonium stearate
- Related additives: [fatty acids](/e570-fatty-acids), [magnesium stearate](/e572-magnesium-stearate), [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)

## Why is ammonium stearate added to food?
Manufacturers use ammonium stearate to help water and fat blend evenly (emulsifying), to keep dry mixes from clumping (anti‑caking), and to help foods release cleanly from molds or equipment (release agent). These functions are common to salts of fatty acids and depend on the product and process.

## What foods contain ammonium stearate?
You are most likely to find E571 in niche or specialty products rather than everyday staples. It may appear in:
- Certain powdered or instant mixes that need to stay free‑flowing
- Coatings or glazes where a release aid is helpful
- Processing steps where a small amount prevents sticking

Label it may appear as “ammonium stearate” or “E571.” If it is used at all, it is typically present at very low levels.

## What can replace ammonium stearate?
Depending on the job it performs, common substitutes include:
- Emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Anti‑caking agents: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide)
- Release/processing aids: [magnesium stearate](/e572-magnesium-stearate) or other [salts of fatty acids](/e470a-sodium-potassium-and-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids)

The best replacement depends on the food, processing conditions, and labeling goals.

## How is ammonium stearate made?
Ammonium stearate is produced by neutralizing stearic acid with ammonium hydroxide, forming the ammonium salt of the fatty acid. Stearic acid itself is commonly obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats, then purified to meet food‑grade specifications.[^3] The EU sets identity and purity criteria for E571 in its additive specifications.[^1]

## Is ammonium stearate safe to eat?
In the European Union, E571 appears on the Union list of permitted food additives and has official specifications that manufacturers must meet.[^1][^2] Like other salts of fatty acids, it is used in small amounts and under good manufacturing practice. In the body, it dissociates into stearate (a typical dietary fatty acid) and ammonium, which are handled by normal metabolic pathways.

## Does ammonium stearate have any benefits?
For consumers, benefits are indirect—more stable powders, smoother textures, and products that process and release reliably. For manufacturers, it can reduce clumping, improve mixing, and help maintain consistent quality during production and storage.

## Who should avoid ammonium stearate?
- Strict vegetarians and vegans: stearic acid can be sourced from either plants or animals. If source matters to you, contact the maker for confirmation.
- People following very specific additive‑free diets: choose products with short ingredient lists or those labeled accordingly.

There are no typical allergy concerns linked to E571 itself.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a soap, so it’s not food.” Fact: Salts of fatty acids can be used to make soaps, but food‑grade salts are purified, carefully specified, and used at low levels for technical effects in foods.[^1]
- “It builds up in the body.” Fact: Ammonium stearate breaks into components your body already handles—stearate and ammonium—so it follows normal digestion and excretion.

## Ammonium stearate in branded foods
This additive is not commonly highlighted on mainstream labels. If present, it will be listed as “ammonium stearate” or “E571.” Ingredient databases and periodic label checks are the best way to confirm current brand use.
