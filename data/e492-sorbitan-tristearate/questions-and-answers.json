      "q": "how is sorbitan monostearate and sorbitan tristearate different",
      "a": "Sorbitan monostearate (E491) has one stearate group, while sorbitan tristearate (E492) has three; this makes E492 more hydrophobic (lower HLB) and better for water‑in‑oil/fat stabilization, whereas E491 has a higher HLB and broader emulsifier uses (e.g., bakery).",

    {
      "q": "what is sorbitan tristearate made from",
      "a": "It’s produced by esterifying sorbitan (from dehydrated sorbitol) with stearic acid, which is typically sourced from vegetable oils (e.g., palm/soy) and can also be from animal fats.",
