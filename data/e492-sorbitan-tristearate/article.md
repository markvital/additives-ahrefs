Sorbitan tristearate (E492) is a food additive used to help oil and water mix and stay mixed. It gives smoother textures and more stable foams and creams in many foods. It is widely used as an emulsifier and stabiliser in the EU.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier and stabiliser made by reacting sorbitol-derived compounds with stearic acid.
- What it does: Helps blend fat and water, improves texture, and keeps products from separating.
- Where it’s found: Chocolate and coatings, whipped toppings, dessert mixes, bakery fillings and glazes, and some spreads.
- Label names: “Sorbitan tristearate” or “E492.”
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU with purity specifications and use limits.

## Why is sorbitan tristearate added to food?
Food makers use sorbitan tristearate to keep fat and water mixed, to stabilize foams and emulsions, and to create smoother textures in creamy or fatty foods. It works well in high-fat systems like chocolate and whipped toppings, where it helps control viscosity and prevents separation.[^2]

## What foods contain sorbitan tristearate?
You may see E492 in:
- Chocolate and compound coatings
- Whipped toppings and dessert mixes
- Fine bakery products (fillings, glazes, and icings)
- Coffee whiteners and other fat-emulsion products
- Chewing gum and some confectionery

In the EU, its permitted food uses and maximum levels are set out in Annex II of the food additives regulation.[^4]

## What can replace sorbitan tristearate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) for general emulsification
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) for bakery and spreads
- [Sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids) for delicate foams and emulsions
- [Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids) for aerated desserts and whippable systems
- Polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (polysorbates), such as [E432](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate), [E433](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [E434](/e434-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monopalmitate), [E435](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate), and [E436](/e436-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-tristearate) when stronger emulsification is needed
- Other sorbitan esters like [E491](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), [E493](/e493-sorbitan-monolaurate), [E494](/e494-sorbitan-monooleate), and [E495](/e495-sorbitan-monopalmitate)

## How is sorbitan tristearate made?
Sorbitan tristearate is produced by reacting sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) that has been dehydrated to “sorbitan” with food-grade stearic acid (a common fatty acid from edible fats and oils). The process yields mainly the triester, with small amounts of related esters; food-grade material must meet strict identity and purity specifications.[^1]

## Is sorbitan tristearate safe to eat?
Yes, when used as authorized. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated sorbitan esters, including E492, and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, expressed as sorbitan. EFSA concluded there is no safety concern at current use levels.[^2] In the EU, E492 must also meet detailed composition and purity criteria before it can be used in food.[^1]

## Does sorbitan tristearate have any benefits?
For food quality, it helps produce smooth textures, stable emulsions, and consistent melting or whipping behavior. It does not add flavor or sweetness and is not a nutrient. Its benefits are technological—better mixing, stability, and handling—rather than nutritional.

## Who should avoid sorbitan tristearate?
Regulators have not identified specific consumer groups who must avoid E492 when it is used as authorized.[^2] People following strict dietary rules (for example, requiring only plant-derived ingredients) may wish to check with manufacturers about the source of the stearic acid. If your healthcare provider advises you to limit emulsifiers in general, review labels and choose products accordingly.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It is a sweetener. Fact: It has no meaningful sweetness and is used for emulsifying and stabilizing.
- Myth: It preserves food. Fact: It is not a preservative; it helps texture and stability.
- Myth: All “sorbitan” additives are the same. Fact: Sorbitan tristearate (E492) differs from polysorbates and other sorbitan esters in strength and best-fit applications.

## Sorbitan tristearate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, it may appear as “sorbitan tristearate” or “E492.” It is common in chocolate and coatings, whipped toppings, dessert mixes, bakery icings and glazes, and some fat-based spreads. Exact use varies by brand and product style.
