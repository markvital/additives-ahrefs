  "description": "Calcium chloride is an inorganic compound, a salt with the chemical formula CaCl2.  It is a colorless crystalline solid at room temperature, highly soluble in water. Calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a hydrated solid with generic formula CaCl2-H2O-x, where x = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.  These compounds are mainly used for de-icing and dust control. Because the anhydrous salt is hygroscopic, it is used as a desiccant.",
