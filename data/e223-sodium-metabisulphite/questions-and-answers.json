      "q": "is sodium metabisulfite bad for you",
      "a": "For most people it isn’t “bad” at the low levels used in foods, but sulfite‑sensitive individuals (including some asthmatics) can have reactions such as wheezing, hives, or headaches. Regulators set a group ADI for sulfites of 0–0.7 mg SO2 equivalents per kg body weight per day.",

      "q": "is sodium metabisulfite safe",
      "a": "Yes—E223 is an approved preservative/antioxidant when used within regulated limits, though sulfites must be declared on labels and can trigger adverse reactions in sensitive people and some asthmatics.",

      "q": "is sodium metabisulfite gluten free",
      "a": "Yes. It’s a synthetic inorganic salt and contains no gluten; any gluten risk would come from other ingredients or cross-contact, not the additive itself.",

      "q": "how much sodium metabisulfite per gallon of wine",
      "a": "To add about 50 mg/L (ppm) SO2 to 1 US gallon, use roughly 0.28 g sodium metabisulfite (about half a sodium Campden tablet); winemakers typically target 25–50 ppm free SO2 depending on pH and often use potassium metabisulfite instead.",
