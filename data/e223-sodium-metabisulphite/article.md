Sodium metabisulphite (E223) is a preservative and antioxidant used to stop foods and drinks from spoiling or turning brown. It belongs to the “sulphites,” a group of additives that release sulphur dioxide to protect color, flavor, and freshness in many products.

## At a glance
- What it is: a white, food‑grade salt that acts as a preservative and antioxidant
- What it does: slows browning, controls microbes, and helps keep flavors stable
- Where you’ll find it: wine, dried fruits, shrimp, potato products, juices, and baked goods
- Label names: “sodium metabisulphite,” “sodium metabisulfite,” “E223,” or “sulphites”
- Diet notes: not suitable for people with sulphite sensitivity or some individuals with asthma
- Usual alternatives: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary), [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- Related additives: other sulphites such as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide), [sodium sulphite](/e221-sodium-sulphite), [sodium bisulphite](/e222-sodium-bisulphite), [potassium metabisulphite](/e224-potassium-metabisulphite), [calcium sulphite](/e226-calcium-sulphite), and [calcium bisulphite](/e227-calcium-bisulphite)

## Why is Sodium metabisulphite added to food?
Manufacturers add E223 to slow down oxidation (a reaction with oxygen) and to stop enzymes that cause browning. This keeps foods looking fresh and tasting consistent. It can also limit the growth of certain bacteria and yeasts, which helps food last longer.

## What foods contain Sodium metabisulphite?
Sodium metabisulphite is authorised for specific uses in many countries. Typical foods include wine and cider, dried fruits, shrimps and prawns, cut or dehydrated potato products, fruit juices and concentrates, and some baked goods and doughs.[^1] In the United States, sulphites at 10 parts per million (ppm) or more must be declared on the label.[^2] In the European Union, “sulphur dioxide and sulphites” must be named when present above 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L, expressed as SO2.[^3]

## What can replace Sodium metabisulphite?
- Browning control in fruits and vegetables: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Oxidation control in oils and snacks: [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Yeast and mold control in drinks and preserves: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- General preservation in acidic foods: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)

The best substitute depends on the food’s pH (acidity), water content, and desired shelf life.

## How is Sodium metabisulphite made?
Food‑grade sodium metabisulphite is typically produced by reacting sulphur dioxide with a sodium base (such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide) to form sodium bisulphite, then converting it to sodium metabisulphite and drying it to a stable powder.[^4]

## Is Sodium metabisulphite safe to eat?
Regulators set limits to keep intake within safe ranges. A long‑standing acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the group of sulphites is 0.7 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as sulphur dioxide (SO2).[^5] In the U.S., sulphites at or above 10 ppm must be declared on food labels, and their use is restricted in certain cases, such as on raw fruits and vegetables served or sold ready‑to‑eat in food establishments.[^2][^6]

## Does Sodium metabisulphite have any benefits?
Yes. It helps foods keep their natural color and flavor, reduces waste from spoilage, and supports consistent quality over a product’s shelf life. One known trade‑off is that sulphites can destroy thiamine (vitamin B1), so they are not suitable in foods where thiamine levels must be protected.[^1]

## Who should avoid Sodium metabisulphite?
- People with known sulphite sensitivity should avoid it.
- Some individuals with asthma may react to sulphites and should follow medical advice about avoidance.[^7]
- Anyone advised by their healthcare professional to limit sulphites (for example, due to past reactions) should read labels carefully.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium metabisulphite is only in wine.” Fact: It appears in many foods, including dried fruit, shrimp, and some baked or potato products.
- Myth: “All preservatives are interchangeable.” Fact: Alternatives work differently depending on acidity, moisture, and storage.
- Myth: “If it’s on the label, the food is unsafe.” Fact: Labels help sensitive consumers avoid reactions; approved uses are set with safety margins.

## Sodium metabisulphite in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sodium metabisulphite,” “sodium metabisulfite,” “E223,” or “sulphites.” Wine bottles in the U.S. must display “Contains sulfites” if the level is 10 ppm or higher.[^8] Brand recipes change over time and by country, so always check the current package or the maker’s website.
