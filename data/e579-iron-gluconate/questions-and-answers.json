      "q": "is ferrous gluconate safe",
      "a": "Yes - E579 is an approved food additive and ferrous gluconate is generally safe at recommended doses; common side effects include nausea, constipation, and dark stools. Keep out of children's reach and avoid use if you have iron overload or are already taking high-iron products unless advised by a clinician.",

      "q": "what is the difference between ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate",
      "a": "Both are ferrous iron salts; ferrous sulfate provides more elemental iron per tablet (about 65 mg in a 325 mg tablet) than ferrous gluconate (about 38 mg in a 324 mg tablet). When matched for elemental iron they absorb similarly, but some people find gluconate gentler on the stomach.",
