Azorubine (E122), also called carmoisine, is a bright red synthetic color used to make foods look red, pink, or purple. It is allowed in the European Union but is not approved for use in foods in the United States.

## At a glance
- Name: Azorubine (E122); also called carmoisine, Food Red 3, C.I. 14720.
- What it does: Food color (adds red to pink shades).
- Appearance: Red to maroon powder; water‑soluble.
- Where it’s allowed: Permitted in the EU; not approved for use in foods in the U.S.
- Labeling: In the EU it appears as “E122” or “carmoisine” and must carry a behavior warning when used.
- Intake guidance: EU acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 4 mg per kg body weight per day.
- Common uses: Soft drinks, syrups, candies, ice creams, jellies, dessert mixes, bakery icings.
- Source: Fully synthetic (not animal‑derived).

## Why is Azorubine added to food?
Color sets expectations. Azorubine gives a stable red hue that helps foods look consistent from batch to batch. Manufacturers use it to restore or boost color lost during processing and to create specific shades that natural colors may not achieve as easily.

## What foods contain Azorubine?
You’re most likely to see E122 in:
- Drinks and syrups (to make red or pink beverages)
- Sugar confectionery and gummies
- Jellies, dessert powders, and ice creams
- Bakery decorations, glazes, and icings

In the EU, you’ll find it on labels as “E122” or “carmoisine.” Outside the EU, its availability varies. Always check the ingredient list.

## What can replace Azorubine?
Depending on the product and desired shade:
- Synthetic alternatives: [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red) (E129)
- Natural reds: [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) (E162), [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) (E163), [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) (E160c), or [cochineal](/e120-cochineal) (E120)

Trade‑offs include differences in shade, stability to heat/light, and how color looks in acidic or dairy foods.

## How is Azorubine made?
Azorubine is a synthetic “azo” dye, meaning its red color comes from an azo bond (–N=N–) joining aromatic rings. In commerce it is typically used as a water‑soluble disodium salt from the sulfonated naphthalene dye family, which helps it dissolve well in foods.[^1][^2] EU specifications set detailed identity and purity criteria for E122 used in foods.[^1]

## Is Azorubine safe to eat?
- EU risk assessors (EFSA) have set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 4 mg per kg body weight per day for Azorubine, based on available toxicology data.[^3]
- Azorubine is not approved as a color additive for use in foods in the United States; FDA import policy lists carmoisine (C.I. 14720) as an unauthorized food color.[^4]
- When Azorubine is used in the EU, labels must include the statement “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children,” a precaution that applies to a group of six azo colors.[^5] EFSA reviewed the “Southampton study” on colors and child behavior and judged the evidence insufficient to revise individual ADIs, but the EU kept the warning to help consumers make informed choices.[^6]
- Food‑grade Azorubine must meet strict EU purity limits, including controls on contaminants and heavy metals.[^1]

## Does Azorubine have any benefits?
This additive does not provide nutrition. Its benefit is practical: it gives foods a clear, even red color that holds up during processing and storage. That can make products look more appealing and consistent from one purchase to the next.

## Who should avoid Azorubine?
- Parents who prefer to avoid the EU‑listed azo colors because of the required behavior warning can choose products without E122.[^5]
- Anyone with a history of sensitivity to synthetic colors should consult their healthcare professional and check labels carefully.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Azorubine adds strawberry flavor.” Fact: It only adds color, not flavor or aroma.
- Myth: “Azorubine and Amaranth are the same dye.” Fact: They are different additives; Amaranth is E123.
- Myth: “It’s natural because it’s from berries.” Fact: Azorubine is fully synthetic.
- Fact: It’s permitted in the EU but not approved for foods in the U.S.

## Azorubine in branded foods
Brand recipes change often. The best way to check is to:
- Look for “E122” or “carmoisine” on the ingredient list.
- In the EU, also look for the statement “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.”
- Scan similar products that use alternatives like [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) or [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) if you want to avoid synthetic reds.
