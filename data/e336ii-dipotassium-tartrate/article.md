Dipotassium tartrate (E336ii) is the potassium salt of tartaric acid that works mainly as an acidity regulator in foods and drinks. It helps keep pH stable, which protects flavor, color, and texture in products such as beverages, confections, and baked goods. It is also known as potassium tartrate or dipotassic tartrate.

## At a glance
- What it is: The dipotassium salt of naturally occurring L(+)-tartaric acid, often sourced from grapes and wine by‑products.
- What it does: Controls acidity (pH), improves flavor balance, and supports stability in recipes.
- Where you’ll find it: Soft drinks, flavored waters, sweets, jams and jellies, and some baking mixes.
- Dietary notes: A simple mineral salt with no animal inputs; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.
- On labels: “Dipotassium tartrate,” “potassium tartrate,” or “E336ii.”

## Why is Dipotassium tartrate added to food?
Manufacturers add dipotassium tartrate to manage acidity and keep pH steady so flavors taste balanced and the color and texture stay consistent over shelf life. In the European Union (EU), potassium tartrates (E 336) are authorized food additives, classified for use as acidity regulators under the food additives regulation.[^1] This role is especially helpful in fruit-flavored drinks and sweets, where small pH shifts can make a big difference in taste.

## What foods contain Dipotassium tartrate?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Beverages: Soft drinks, flavored waters, sports and energy drinks
- Sweets: Gummies, fruit chews, hard candies
- Fruit products: Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Baking: Some baking mixes and powders alongside leavening agents like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)

Because labeling rules vary by region and brand, it may appear regularly in certain categories and not at all in others.

## What can replace Dipotassium tartrate?
Depending on the recipe, common substitutes for controlling acidity include:
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or its salts such as [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) and [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for a smoother sourness
- Other tartrates such as [sodium tartrates](/e335-sodium-tartrates) or [potassium sodium tartrate](/e337-potassium-sodium-tartrate)
- Direct use of [L‑tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) when a stronger acidifying effect is desired

The “best” alternative depends on taste, pH target, and how the product is processed.

## How is Dipotassium tartrate made?
Food‑grade dipotassium tartrate is produced by neutralizing L(+)-tartaric acid with a potassium base (such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate), yielding the dipotassium salt. In the EU, specifications require that it is made from the L(+) form of tartaric acid and meet strict purity criteria set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is Dipotassium tartrate safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended. In the EU, only additives that pass a scientific safety evaluation can be placed on the Union list; this process is defined under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 and applied to additives authorized by Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^3] Potassium tartrates (E 336) are authorized acidity regulators in the EU, and food‑grade material must comply with identity and purity requirements before use.[^1][^2] As with any potassium salt, overall dietary potassium from all sources should be considered for people who need to limit potassium.

## Does Dipotassium tartrate have any benefits?
- Product quality: Stable pH helps keep flavors bright and colors steady in fruit‑based foods and drinks.
- Process performance: Controlled acidity can support consistent gelling, setting, or texture in confections and fruit spreads.
- Sensory balance: Compared to stronger acids, tartrate salts can fine‑tune tartness without making products overly sour.

## Who should avoid Dipotassium tartrate?
Most people don’t need to avoid it. However, individuals on potassium‑restricted diets—such as some people with chronic kidney disease or those at risk of high blood potassium (hyperkalemia)—should monitor total potassium intake from all foods, including potassium salts used as additives.[^4] If you’ve been advised to limit potassium, check labels and consult your healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E‑numbers are unsafe.” Fact: E‑numbers are simply codes for approved additives reviewed by authorities like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Authorization means their uses are regulated.
- Myth: “Tartrates are synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Tartaric acid occurs naturally in grapes; its potassium salts are made by neutralizing that acid.
- Myth: “All tartrates are the same.” Fact: Different salts (e.g., mono‑ vs dipotassium tartrate) and acids (tartric vs citric or malic) affect taste and pH control differently.
- Myth: “It always changes flavor.” Fact: At the small amounts used, its job is to balance, not dominate, flavor.

## Dipotassium tartrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “dipotassium tartrate,” “potassium tartrate,” or “E336ii.” You’ll most often find it in flavored beverages, fruit candies, jams and jellies, and some baking mixes. If a product uses other acid regulators instead, you might see [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), or citrate salts such as [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates).
