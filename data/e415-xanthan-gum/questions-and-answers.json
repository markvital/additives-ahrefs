    {
      "q": "what does xanthan gum do",
      "a": "It works as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier—adding viscosity, suspending particles, and preventing separation. In gluten-free baking it helps bind dough and improve texture, and it’s shear‑thinning so it pours easily but thickens at rest.",
