Amaranth (E123) is a bright, water‑soluble red color made in the lab and used to tint foods and drinks. It is no longer allowed in the United States but remains permitted for limited uses in the European Union under strict purity rules. Below, we explain why it’s used, where it appears, and what the safety agencies say about it.

## At a glance
- Amaranth is a synthetic red azo dye used to color foods and beverages.
- It delivers vivid red to purple tones and dissolves easily in water.
- Still authorized for limited uses in the European Union; delisted in the United States.
- Also known as FD&C Red No. 2 (historic U.S. name).
- Common swaps include other reds such as [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red), [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r), [Azorubine](/e122-azorubine), [Erythrosine](/e127-erythrosine), or natural colors like [Beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) and [Cochineal](/e120-cochineal).
- Vegan and vegetarian friendly (it’s synthetic).

## Why is Amaranth added to food?
Color sets expectations. Amaranth gives a consistent, bright red shade that holds up in many recipes, especially those with water-based syrups, gels, and coatings. Because it is water‑soluble, manufacturers can blend it evenly into drinks, candies, and toppings to make products look appealing and uniform from batch to batch.

## What foods contain Amaranth?
Where it is permitted (for example, in the EU), Amaranth can appear in specific categories such as sweets, dessert decorations, flavored drinks, and certain specialty items. The exact list of allowed foods and maximum use levels is set in EU law, not left to manufacturer choice. These permissions and limits are published in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 (Annex II).[^3]

## What can replace Amaranth?
- Other synthetic reds: [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red), [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r), [Azorubine](/e122-azorubine), or [Erythrosine](/e127-erythrosine), each with its own shade and stability.
- Natural reds: [Beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) gives a pink-red hue but can fade with heat; [Cochineal](/e120-cochineal) and carmine give stable crimson tones but are insect‑derived.
- Color blends: Makers often mix reds with yellows like [Sunset Yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf) to reach oranges, or with blues like [Brilliant Blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf) for purplish notes.

## How is Amaranth made?
Amaranth is produced by standard azo‑dye chemistry. In simple terms, a “diazotized” intermediate is coupled with a naphthol compound, then the product is sulfonated and neutralized to form a highly water‑soluble sodium salt. Identity and purity specifications for food use are set out in international safety monographs and EU additive specifications.[^4][^2]

## Is Amaranth safe to eat?
Safety decisions differ by region:
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delisted FD&C Red No. 2 (Amaranth) in 1976, so it is not permitted for use in foods sold in the U.S.[^1]
- European Union: The EU still authorizes Amaranth for limited uses and requires it to meet strict identity and purity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2] The types of foods and maximum levels are set in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^3]

Regulators review color additives by looking at exposure, toxicology, and how and where the color is used. If rules change, they are published through official updates.

## Does Amaranth have any benefits?
Amaranth’s benefit is cosmetic. It improves or restores color so foods look attractive and consistent. It does not add nutrition, flavor, or aroma.

## Who should avoid Amaranth?
- People in the United States won’t find it in legally marketed foods, since it is not permitted there.[^1]
- Anyone advised by their doctor to avoid azo dyes should steer clear.
- If you prefer to avoid synthetic colors altogether, choose products colored with fruit or vegetable extracts or other natural sources.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Amaranth the food color comes from the amaranth plant. Fact: The dye is fully synthetic and not derived from the plant.
- Myth: Amaranth is approved in the U.S. Fact: It was delisted by the FDA and is not allowed in U.S. foods.[^1]
- Myth: Amaranth carries the EU attention‑and‑activity warning for children. Fact: That specific label warning applies to a defined set of other synthetic colors under EU rules, not to E123.[^3]

## Amaranth in branded foods
If you shop in the EU or other regions where it’s allowed, check ingredient lists for “Amaranth” or “E123.” In the U.S., you should not see it on food labels. When in doubt, contact the manufacturer’s consumer line and ask which red color they use and why.
