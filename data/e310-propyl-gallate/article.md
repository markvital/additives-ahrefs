Propyl gallate (E310) is an antioxidant that helps keep fats and oils in foods from going rancid. It protects flavor, aroma, and color in fat-rich foods by slowing oxidation, which extends shelf life.

## At a glance
This additive is mainly used to protect fats and oils from going stale.

- What it is: The propyl ester of gallic acid; a fat-soluble antioxidant
- What it does: Slows oxidation to prevent rancid flavors and odors
- Common in: Edible oils, shortenings, margarine/spreads, baked snacks, and other fat-containing foods
- Also called: E310, propyl ester of gallic acid
- Typical level: Very small amounts, often up to 0.02% of the fat or oil part of a food
- Often paired with: Other antioxidants like [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq), [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate), [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Dietary notes: Typically made synthetically; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets

## Why is propyl gallate added to food?
Fats and oils react with oxygen over time, creating rancid tastes and odors. Propyl gallate donates electrons to stop these chain reactions, so foods keep their intended flavor longer. In the United States, it may be used as an antioxidant in fats and oils and in foods that contain fats or oils, typically at levels not above 0.02% of the fat or oil portion of the food.[^1] It can be used alone or together with other antioxidants such as [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha) or [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene) when following the same overall limit.[^1]

## What foods contain propyl gallate?
You are most likely to see it in products where protecting fats really matters. Examples include:
- Vegetable oils and shortenings
- Margarine and spreads
- Baked goods and snack foods that contain added fats
- Certain fat-based seasonings or mixes

In the U.S., its use is limited to small amounts in fats/oils and foods that contain them, as described in federal regulations.[^1]

## What can replace propyl gallate?
Food makers often pick from several antioxidants, depending on the recipe and desired label:

- Synthetic options: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- “Vitamin” and enzyme-derived options: [tocopherols (vitamin E)](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate), [ascorbic acid (vitamin C)](/e300-ascorbic-acid)
- Helpers that boost antioxidant performance: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

Some antimicrobial preservatives like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) are not true replacements because they target microbes, not fat oxidation.

## How is propyl gallate made?
It is the propyl ester of gallic acid. Industrially, manufacturers typically make it by reacting gallic acid with n-propanol (an alcohol) under acid-catalyzed conditions, then purifying the product. The result is usually a white, crystalline powder that is only slightly soluble in water but dissolves well in oils and alcohols.[^3]

## Is propyl gallate safe to eat?
Safety depends on using the additive within legal limits and for approved purposes. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits propyl gallate for use as an antioxidant in specified foods with defined maximum levels and purity criteria.[^1] The FDA’s Food Additive Status List also records propyl gallate as a regulated food additive and points to the detailed regulation.[^2] In the European Union, propyl gallate is authorized as E310 under the food additives framework regulation, which sets the conditions for its use and labeling.[^4]

## Does propyl gallate have any benefits?
For consumers, the practical benefits are about food quality:
- Helps keep fats and oils from turning rancid
- Helps protect flavor, aroma, and color in fat-rich foods
- Can work in combination with other antioxidants to improve shelf life

This is a technological benefit to the food; it is not added for nutritional or medical effects.

## Who should avoid propyl gallate?
Most people do not need to avoid this additive when it is used as allowed. If you prefer to avoid synthetic preservatives, look for products that use alternatives like [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) or are labeled “no artificial preservatives.” People with specific dietary restrictions or medical advice should follow their healthcare provider’s guidance. Regulations may set stricter rules for particular foods (such as foods for infants) in some regions.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Propyl gallate is the same as propylene glycol.” Fact: They are different substances; propyl gallate is an antioxidant, while propylene glycol is a solvent and humectant.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative for germs.” Fact: Propyl gallate fights oxidation, not bacteria or mold. Antimicrobials like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) serve that role.
- Myth: “If a food has propyl gallate, it must be unsafe.” Fact: Its use is regulated with strict limits and purity standards set by authorities in the U.S. and EU.[^1][^4]

## propyl gallate in branded foods
On labels, look for “propyl gallate,” “E310,” or “antioxidant (propyl gallate).” You’ll most often find it in shelf-stable, fat-rich items like cooking oils, shortenings, margarine/spreads, and certain baked snacks. Many brands instead use mixed [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) or other antioxidants, so you may also see those listed.
