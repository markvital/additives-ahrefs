Ethyl gallate (E313) is an antioxidant used to slow down the rancidity of fats and oils. It is the ethyl ester of gallic acid, and is added in very small amounts to help protect flavor, aroma, and color during storage. Approval and allowed uses vary by country, so you may or may not see it on local labels.

## At a glance

- What it is: an antioxidant made by combining gallic acid with ethanol
- What it does: helps keep fats and oils from going rancid
- Where it shows up: used in small amounts in some processed foods, depending on local rules
- Also known as: Ethyl gallate, E313
- Related additives: [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate), [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate)
- Typical pairing: often used alongside other antioxidants like [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)

## Why is Ethyl gallate added to food?

Manufacturers add ethyl gallate to slow oxidation, the chemical reaction that makes oils smell and taste “off.” By neutralizing reactive oxygen species, it helps keep flavors stable and delays color changes that come with rancidity.[^1]

Gallate antioxidants as a group are used in tiny amounts because they are potent; they are often combined with other antioxidants to create a broader shield against oxidation during processing, storage, and transport.[^2]

## What foods contain Ethyl gallate?

Where permitted, gallate antioxidants are most often used in foods rich in fat, such as edible oils and oil-containing mixes. In U.S. rules, the gallates you are most likely to see on labels are [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate), and [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate), which are listed for use at very low levels in specific foods like fats and oils and certain mixes.[^2][^3][^4]

Labeling practices differ by region. Some countries list antioxidants by their common name (for example, “ethyl gallate”), others by an E-number (for example, “E313”) on ingredient lists.[^5]

## What can replace Ethyl gallate?

Several antioxidants can play a similar role:

- Other gallates: [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate), [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate)[^2][^3][^4]
- Vitamins and plant-based antioxidants: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) and [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)[^2]
- Acids and chelators that slow oxidation indirectly: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

The best substitute depends on the food matrix, processing, flavor impact, and local regulations.

## How is Ethyl gallate made?

Ethyl gallate is typically made by reacting gallic acid with ethanol to form an ester, a standard food-chemistry process known as esterification. Gallic acid itself can be produced industrially or obtained from plant tannins, which are polyphenols found in materials like gallnuts and certain woods.[^1]

## Is Ethyl gallate safe to eat?

Safety and allowable uses are set by each jurisdiction. In the European Union, the list of food additives that may be used in foods and the conditions of their use is laid out in the Union list (Annex II) established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011; manufacturers must follow those limits when formulating foods placed on the EU market.[^5]

In the United States, FDA regulations specify which antioxidants of the gallate family may be added to food and in what amounts; propyl, octyl, and dodecyl gallates are listed with specific maximum use levels in defined foods.[^2][^3][^4] Consumers should check local rules and labels to see which antioxidants are permitted where they live.

## Does Ethyl gallate have any benefits?

For food quality, the benefit is straightforward: it helps preserve freshness by protecting fats from oxidation. This can maintain flavor, reduce “off” aromas, and help keep natural colors longer during shelf life.[^1]

## Who should avoid Ethyl gallate?

- People following medical advice to avoid certain phenolic antioxidants should consult their clinician before consuming foods that list gallates.
- If you have had a prior sensitivity to gallate antioxidants in foods or topical products, consider avoiding related compounds and discuss with a healthcare professional.

As always, check labels and follow local dietary guidance.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “All E-numbers are artificial and harmful.” Fact: An E-number simply means the additive has been evaluated for use in the EU; many E-numbered substances are identical to compounds found in nature, and their safety depends on dose and context.[^5]
- Myth: “Ethyl gallate and propyl gallate are the same thing.” Fact: They are different esters of gallic acid. They have similar antioxidant roles but may have different approvals and permitted uses depending on the country.[^2][^3][^4][^5]

## Ethyl gallate in branded foods

If present, you might see it on labels as “ethyl gallate” or “E313.” In some markets you are more likely to find other gallates listed instead, such as [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate), or [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate), depending on local approvals.[^2][^3][^4][^5]
