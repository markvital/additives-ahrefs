Glycerol (E422) is a clear, syrupy liquid that helps foods stay moist, soft, and stable. Also called glycerin or glycerine, it adds mild sweetness and dissolves flavors and colors in many everyday products such as baked goods, confections, and beverages.

## At a glance
- What it is: A colorless, syrupy polyol (multiple–OH alcohol) used in food.
- What it does: Keeps moisture in (humectant), dissolves flavors and colors (solvent), adds body, and provides gentle sweetness.
- Where it’s found: Soft cakes and cookies, icing and fondant, candies and gum, dried fruit, protein bars, and drinks.
- Label names: Glycerol, glycerin, glycerine, sometimes “vegetable glycerine.”
- How it’s made: From plant oils or animal fats, or by chemical synthesis.
- Diet notes: Plant-derived glycerol is common; check labels or the brand if source matters to you.
- Safety: Approved in the U.S. and EU when used as intended; very high intakes may cause stomach upset.

## Why is Glycerol added to food?
Glycerol mainly helps foods hold onto water so they stay soft and don’t dry out. It also acts as a solvent for flavors and colors, adds mild sweetness, and can slightly thicken liquids.[^1]

## What foods contain Glycerol?
You’ll most often see glycerol in foods that benefit from softness, moisture, or smooth texture. Examples include:
- Bakery items such as soft cookies, snack cakes, and frostings
- Confections like fondant, marshmallows, and caramels
- Chewing gum and mints
- Dried fruits to reduce stickiness and hardening
- Nutrition and protein bars
- Flavor concentrates and some beverages

In the EU, glycerol (E422) is authorized across many food categories, reflecting these common uses.[^2]

## What can replace Glycerol?
Several additives can fill similar roles, depending on the goal:
- To keep moisture and softness: polyols such as [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), or [maltitol](/e965-maltitol)
- As a solvent for flavors and colors: [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol)
- To build body or improve texture: hydrocolloids like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [agar](/e406-agar)
- For bulk with fewer sugars: [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose)

Each option has its own taste, texture, and labeling differences, so formulators choose based on the product and dietary goals.

## How is Glycerol made?
Commercial glycerol comes from two main routes. It can be obtained by splitting natural fats and oils (for example during soapmaking or biodiesel production), yielding glycerol along with fatty acids.[^3] It can also be produced synthetically from petrochemical sources (such as propene/propylene) through well-established chemical processes.[^3]

## Is Glycerol safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, glycerin is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^4] In the European Union, the food additive glycerol (E422) has been re-evaluated, with no safety concern at reported uses and use levels.[^2] As with many polyols, very high amounts may cause digestive discomfort in some people due to their osmotic effect.[^2]

## Does Glycerol have any benefits?
For consumers, glycerol helps foods stay moist and palatable, keeps icings smooth, and can reduce sugar crystallization in sweets. It also helps carry and evenly distribute flavors and colors. Because it is only mildly sweet, it can fine-tune sweetness without making products taste sugary.

## Who should avoid Glycerol?
- People who notice bloating or diarrhea after consuming large amounts of polyols may wish to limit products high in glycerol.
- If you avoid animal-derived ingredients, look for “vegetable glycerine” on labels or check with the manufacturer about the source.
- Individuals on special medical diets should follow their healthcare provider’s advice about all carbohydrates and polyols.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Glycerol is always vegan.” Fact: It can be made from vegetable oils or animal fats; many brands use plant sources, but the source can vary.[^3]
- Myth: “Glycerol and propylene glycol are the same.” Fact: They are different additives with different E‑numbers (E422 vs. [E1520](/e1520-propylene-glycol)) and properties.
- Myth: “Glycerol is a preservative.” Fact: Its primary roles are humectant, solvent, and texture modifier; it’s not an antimicrobial preservative by itself.[^1]
- Myth: “Glycerol is sugar-free so it’s calorie-free.” Fact: It contributes calories even though it is less sweet than table sugar.

## Glycerol in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “glycerol,” “glycerin,” “glycerine,” or “vegetable glycerine.” You’ll commonly find it in soft cookies and snack cakes, jarred icings and fondants, protein bars and meal replacements, chewing gum, certain candies and marshmallows, flavored syrups and some beverages, and in dried fruit mixes to help maintain softness.
