      "q": "why is my s*** green",
      "a": "Foods or drinks colored with Green S (E142) or other green/blue dyes can pass through and temporarily turn stool green; this is usually harmless and resolves once the colorant is out of your system.",

      "q": "are s&h green stamps worth anything",
      "a": "That’s unrelated to E142—Green S is a synthetic green food dye; S&H Green Stamps were a retail loyalty stamp and not a food additive.",

      "q": "what were s&h green stamps",

      "q": "what are s&h green stamps",

      "q": "what does it mean when your s*** is green",
      "a": "In places where Green S (E142) is allowed (EU, Australia/NZ), eating foods dyed with it can make stool appear green; if it persists without recent intake of dyed foods, consider speaking with a healthcare professional.",
