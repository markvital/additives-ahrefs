Calcium malate (E352i) is the calcium salt of malic acid. Food makers use it mainly to control acidity and give a gentle, lingering tart taste without sharp sourness. You’ll most often see it on labels as “calcium malate,” “E352,” or “E352i”.

## At a glance
- What it is: the calcium salt of malic acid (an organic acid found in many fruits).
- E-number: E352i, part of the “calcium malates” group (E352).
- What it does: acidity regulator and pH buffer that lends a smooth, mild tartness.
- Where it’s used: drinks, fruit fillings, jams, candies, and some bakery items.
- Label names: “calcium malate,” “E352,” or “E352i”.

## Why is Calcium malate added to food?
Calcium malate helps set and hold a target pH, which stabilizes flavor, texture, and color across shelf life. It also adds a clean, mellow tartness that lasts longer than some sharper acids, making it useful in beverages and fruit-flavored products.

Because it controls acidity, it can support safe processing of acidified foods by helping keep pH in a range that discourages growth of harmful microbes when used with proper manufacturing practices.[^3]

## What foods contain Calcium malate?
You may find calcium malate in flavored drinks, fruit preparations (like jams and pie fillings), confectionery, and some bakery items. In the European Union, it is an authorised food additive (E352) in a broad range of food categories; always check the ingredient list for “calcium malate,” “E352,” or “E352i”.[^2]

## What can replace Calcium malate?
Depending on the goal, formulators might switch to:
- For stronger sourness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid).
- For buffering capacity with a softer taste: [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) itself.
- For similar pH control with different cations: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates), or [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates).
Choice depends on desired taste profile, solubility, mineral content, and local regulations.

## How is Calcium malate made?
Calcium malate is produced by neutralising purified malic acid with a suitable calcium source (such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide), followed by filtration and drying to meet food-grade purity criteria.[^1]

## Is Calcium malate safe to eat?
In the EU, calcium malate is an authorised food additive with detailed identity and purity specifications set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1] Its permitted uses and general conditions of use are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008; when used according to these rules and good manufacturing practice, it is considered acceptable for use in food.[^2]

## Does Calcium malate have any benefits?
- Taste and formulation: It provides a smooth, lingering tartness and helps keep product pH steady, which can protect flavor and texture.
- Food safety support: In acidified foods, maintaining the right pH is a key control that helps prevent the growth of dangerous microbes when combined with proper processing.[^3]
- Familiarity: Malic acid, the parent acid of calcium malate, occurs naturally in many fruits, such as apples, which is why its tartness tastes familiar.[^4]

## Who should avoid Calcium malate?
Most people don’t need to avoid calcium malate when it’s used in foods. Individuals on medically supervised diets that restrict calcium or acidulants should follow their clinician’s advice. As with any additive, if you notice a personal sensitivity to tart, acidic foods, check labels and choose alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- “All E-numbers are artificial.” Many E-numbered additives occur in nature or are identical to natural compounds. Malic acid, related to calcium malate, is found in fruits like apples.[^4]
- “Acidity regulators make foods very sour.” They can add sourness, but their main job is to buffer and stabilise pH, which doesn’t always translate into a strongly sour taste.

## Calcium malate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “calcium malate,” “E352,” or “E352i.” It may appear alongside other acidifiers like [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid). Product labels and manufacturer websites are the best place to confirm its presence in a specific brand.
