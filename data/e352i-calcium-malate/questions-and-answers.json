      "q": "what is calcium citrate malate",
      "a": "Calcium citrate malate is a mixed calcium salt of citric and malic acids used as a calcium source in foods and supplements. It is related to but distinct from E352i (calcium malate), which contains only malate.",

      "q": "what is calcium citrate malate made from",
      "a": "It is typically made by neutralizing citric and malic acids (often produced by fermentation) with a mineral calcium source such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide.",

      "q": "what is calcium malate made from",
      "a": "Calcium malate (E352i) is made by neutralizing malic acid—usually produced by microbial fermentation of sugars—with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide.",

    {
      "q": "calcium citrate malate where is it sourced from",
      "a": "The citric and malic acids are commonly produced by microbial fermentation of sugars, while the calcium comes from mineral sources like limestone (calcium carbonate); it’s manufactured in many countries.",

      "q": "how calcium malate affects stomach acid",
      "a": "As a salt of a weak organic acid, it has little acid-neutralizing effect compared with calcium carbonate. Its calcium is absorbed well even when stomach acid is low.",
