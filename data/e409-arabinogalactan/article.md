Arabinogalactan (E409) is a natural, water‑soluble fiber made of the sugars arabinose and galactose. In foods, it is mainly used to stabilize beverages, improve texture, and help keep ingredients evenly mixed.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant polysaccharide (long-chain carbohydrate) obtained mainly from larch wood
- What it does: stabilizer, thickener, and texture improver in drinks and other foods
- Taste and look: neutral taste; dissolves well in water; usually a fine powder
- Label names: arabinogalactan, larch arabinogalactan, E409
- Regulation: specified in the EU food additive rules; evaluated for safety by EU and international bodies

## Why is arabinogalactan added to food?
Food makers add arabinogalactan to improve stability and texture. It helps keep flavors and particles suspended in beverages, adds body and smooth mouthfeel, and can reduce phase separation in liquid products.[^1] In EU law, it is listed with specifications as a food additive, supporting its use as a stabilizer and thickener under good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^2]

## What foods contain arabinogalactan?
You are most likely to find arabinogalactan in:
- Flavored and cloudy beverages (to keep the drink uniform)
- Juice drinks and liquid concentrates
- Some confectionery, sauces, and dairy or plant-based drink products

Authorised uses and typical food categories are described in international standards and EU evaluations for additive E409.[^1][^4]

## What can replace arabinogalactan?
Depending on the recipe and the role it plays, common stand-ins include:
- Other plant gums and hydrocolloids: [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- Soluble fibers and texturizers: [pectins](/e440-pectins), [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose)
- For beverage cloud/emulsion stability: [glycerol esters of wood rosin](/e445-glycerol-esters-of-wood-rosin)

Each alternative behaves differently, so formulas often need small adjustments.

## How is arabinogalactan made?
Commercial arabinogalactan is typically extracted from the wood of larch trees (genus Larix). The process usually involves water extraction of the wood material, followed by clarification and purification steps such as filtration and drying to yield a food‑grade powder that meets official specifications.[^2][^3]

## Is arabinogalactan safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated arabinogalactan (E409) and did not identify safety concerns at the reported uses and use levels in food.[^1] International expert committees have also assessed arabinogalactan and established food‑grade specifications for its identity and purity.[^3] As with many soluble fibers, large sudden intakes may cause mild digestive effects (like gas) in some people; using it within normal food amounts helps avoid this.

## Does arabinogalactan have any benefits?
Functionally, arabinogalactan:
- Improves texture and mouthfeel in drinks and other foods
- Helps keep ingredients evenly mixed and stable during shelf life[^1]

It is a soluble, non‑digestible polysaccharide, which means it behaves like dietary fiber in the gut. However, health benefits depend on overall diet and product formulation; food additive approvals focus on safety and technological need, not health claims.[^1]

## Who should avoid arabinogalactan?
- People advised by a healthcare professional to limit added fibers should check labels.
- Individuals with sensitive digestion may wish to introduce fiber‑containing foods gradually.
- Those with specific allergies or sensitivities should consult their clinician; although arabinogalactan itself is not a common allergen, finished products may contain other allergens.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Arabinogalactan is the same as gum arabic. Fact: They are different additives; gum arabic is [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) (E414), while arabinogalactan is E409.[^2]
- Myth: It’s a synthetic chemical. Fact: Food‑grade arabinogalactan is typically extracted from larch wood and purified for use in foods.[^2][^3]
- Myth: It’s unsafe in drinks. Fact: EFSA reviewed E409 and found no safety concern at reported uses and levels in food.[^1]

## arabinogalactan in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “arabinogalactan,” “larch arabinogalactan,” or “E409.” It most often appears in flavored or cloudy drinks, concentrated beverages, and some confections or sauces. Brands may change recipes over time, so always check current packaging.
