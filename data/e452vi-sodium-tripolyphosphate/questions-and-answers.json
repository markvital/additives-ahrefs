      "q": "how to remove sodium tripolyphosphate from fish",
      "a": "You can reduce surface residues by rinsing and briefly soaking the fish in cold water (e.g., 10–20 minutes with water changes), but once absorbed it can’t be fully removed; choosing phosphate‑free products is the only way to avoid it entirely.",

      "a": "Yes—when used within legal limits set by authorities like EFSA and FDA; EFSA has a group ADI for phosphates of 40 mg/kg body weight per day (as phosphorus), and people with kidney disease should limit intake of phosphate additives.",
