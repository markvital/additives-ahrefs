      "q": "how does anthocynin relate to chromatography of carotene and xanthophylls",
      "a": "Anthocyanins are water‑soluble flavonoid pigments, while carotene and xanthophylls are fat‑soluble carotenoids; in typical nonpolar chromatography, carotene travels furthest, xanthophylls less, and anthocyanins barely move or require a more polar solvent system.",
