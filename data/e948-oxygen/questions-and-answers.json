      "q": "how to increase blood oxygen level",
      "a": "If your level is low or you have symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, bluish lips), seek urgent medical care; improving ventilation, sitting upright, slow deep breathing, and treating underlying causes can help, while supplemental oxygen should only be used under medical supervision.",
