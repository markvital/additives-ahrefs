Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E215) is a preservative from the paraben family. It helps stop the growth of molds and yeasts, especially in sweet or acidic foods and drinks. E215 is the sodium salt of ethylparaben, which makes it more water‑soluble and easier to use in beverages and syrups.

## At a glance
- What it is: the sodium salt of ethylparaben, a paraben-type preservative.
- What it does: inhibits molds and yeasts to help keep foods safe and fresh longer.
- Where it’s used: commonly in flavored drinks, syrups, confectionery fillings, and fruit-based sauces (in places where it’s allowed).
- Other names you might see: E215, sodium ethylparaben, sodium ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate, INS 215.
- Regulation: assessed by international bodies; actual permission and use levels vary by country or region.

## Why is Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
Food makers use E215 to control spoilage from molds and yeasts. That protects flavor, color, and texture, and helps prevent waste. It is recognized internationally as a preservative under the Codex (INS 215), though national rules determine whether and where it can be used and at what levels.[^2]

## What foods contain Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
When permitted, you’re most likely to find E215 in:
- Flavored beverages and ready-to-drink teas
- Sugar syrups and dessert toppings
- Fruit sauces, jams, and pie fillings
- Confectionery gels and glazes
- Acidic sauces and marinades

On labels, it may appear as “sodium ethylparaben,” “sodium ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate,” “E215,” or “INS 215.”

## What can replace Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Depending on the food and pH, makers might use:
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- [Benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- [Calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate) for baked goods
- [Dimethyl dicarbonate](/e242-dimethyl-dicarbonate) for some beverages
- Natural antimicrobials for specific foods, such as [nisin](/e234-nisin) or [natamycin](/e235-natamycin)

Formulators often combine preservatives with good hygiene, pH control, and packaging to achieve the needed shelf life.

## How is Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate made?
E215 is typically produced by neutralizing ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoic acid (ethylparaben) with a sodium base to form the sodium salt. Making the salt increases water solubility, which helps it disperse in water-based foods and drinks.

## Is Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
International experts have set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–10 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for methyl and ethyl parabens and their sodium salts, based on toxicology data and how the body handles these compounds.[^1] Parabens are quickly broken down to p‑hydroxybenzoic acid and excreted, which limits their potential to build up in the body.[^4] 

Concerns about “hormone-like” effects stem from weak estrogenic activity seen in some lab tests, but major regulators note this activity is far lower than natural hormones and is not considered a safety concern at typical exposure levels.[^3] As always, actual permissions and maximum use levels depend on local regulations.

Note: ADI means acceptable daily intake—the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
- Extends shelf life by preventing mold and yeast growth, helping reduce food waste.
- Helps keep flavor and color stable in sweet or acidic products.
- Because it’s a sodium salt, it dissolves well in water-based foods, which can improve consistency in beverages and syrups.

## Who should avoid Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
- People with a known paraben sensitivity or allergy should avoid E215 and related parabens such as [ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e214-ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), [propyl paraben](/e216-propyl-para-hydroxybenzoate), and [sodium propyl paraben](/e217-sodium-propyl-para-hydroxybenzoate). If you have had reactions to products containing parabens, speak with your healthcare provider.[^3]
- If your clinician has advised you to avoid parabens for any reason, check labels for “paraben,” “p‑hydroxybenzoate,” “E215,” or “INS 215.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Parabens cause cancer.” Fact: Regulatory reviews have not found evidence that parabens in consumer products cause cancer at typical exposure levels.[^3]
- Myth: “Parabens build up in the body.” Fact: They are rapidly metabolized and excreted, which limits accumulation.[^1]
- Myth: “All parabens act like strong hormones.” Fact: Parabens have weak estrogenic activity in some tests, far below natural estrogen, and current exposure levels are not considered a safety concern by major regulators.[^3]

## Sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for: “sodium ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate,” “sodium ethylparaben,” “E215,” or “INS 215.” You’ll most often see it in sweet or acidic, water-based products that need yeast and mold control, such as flavored drinks, syrups, toppings, and fruit fillings. If you wish to avoid it, scan labels for those names or choose products preserved with alternatives like [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate).
