Calcium lactate (E327) is the calcium salt of lactic acid. Food makers use it to help keep fruits and vegetables firm, regulate acidity, and add a mild source of calcium to recipes. It’s widely permitted in the U.S. and EU and is considered safe when used in normal amounts in foods.

## At a glance
Calcium lactate is a versatile helper in both everyday foods and culinary techniques.
- What it is: a salt made from lactic acid and calcium.
- What it does: helps firm texture, buffers acidity, blends smoothly in liquids, and supplies dietary calcium.
- Where it shows up: canned and pickled produce, fortified drinks, plant-based products, bakery fillings, and modernist “spherification.”
- How it’s made: by neutralizing [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) with [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate) or [calcium hydroxide](/e526-calcium-hydroxide), then crystallizing and drying.
- Safety status: affirmed “GRAS” in the U.S. and authorized in the EU as E327.

## Why is calcium lactate added to food?
Food makers add calcium lactate to do a few jobs at once. It tightens the structure of fruits and vegetables (a “firming” effect), stabilizes pH as an acidity regulator, and dissolves easily in water so it blends well in beverages and syrups. In some recipes it also serves as a mild thickener and a way to add extra calcium without gritty texture. In the EU it’s an authorized additive identified as E327.[^1]

## What foods contain calcium lactate?
You’ll most often see calcium lactate in:
- Canned or jarred fruits and vegetables, pickles, and relishes
- Fortified drinks and drink mixes
- Plant-based dairy alternatives, desserts, and confectionery
- Bakery fillings, glazes, and icings
- Culinary gels and “spherification” systems using alginates

On labels, it may appear as “calcium lactate” or “E327.”

## What can replace calcium lactate?
Depending on the job, common stand-ins include:
- Firming/binding: [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride)
- pH control and buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- Humectancy and mild preservation in meats and sauces: [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate) or [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate)
- Calcium fortification: [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate), [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates), [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate), or [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates)
- Gelling/setting systems: pair calcium salts such as [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride) or [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate) with [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate)

## How is calcium lactate made?
Commercially, it’s produced by neutralizing food‑grade lactic acid (usually made by fermenting sugars) with a calcium base such as [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate) or [calcium hydroxide](/e526-calcium-hydroxide). The product is then crystallized, separated, and dried to yield a white, nearly tasteless powder.[^2]

## Is calcium lactate safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, calcium lactate is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated lactic acid and lactates (E270, E325–E327) and found no safety concern at current uses, with an acceptable daily intake (ADI) “not specified.”[^3]

## Does calcium lactate have any benefits?
Beyond its technical roles, calcium lactate supplies calcium. By weight, calcium lactate provides about 13% elemental calcium, which helps explain why it is often used in beverages where solubility matters more than maximum calcium density.[^4]

## Who should avoid calcium lactate?
- People told to limit calcium (for example, due to certain kidney or parathyroid conditions) should check with a healthcare professional.
- Calcium can interact with some medications by reducing their absorption; spacing doses might be advised. Ask a pharmacist or clinician for guidance.[^4]
- Despite the similar name, “lactate” is not the milk sugar “lactose.” This ingredient does not supply lactose.

## Myths & facts
- “It comes from milk.” Fact: Food‑grade calcium lactate is typically made by fermenting sugars to lactic acid, then neutralizing with a calcium source—no dairy required.[^2]
- “An E‑number means artificial or unsafe.” Fact: E‑numbers are simply EU identifiers for approved additives; they include both natural and synthetic substances.
- “Lactate equals lactose.” Fact: Lactate is the salt of lactic acid; lactose is a disaccharide sugar. They are different compounds.

## calcium lactate in branded foods
To spot it on labels, look for “calcium lactate” or “E327.” You’ll often find it alongside other acidity regulators or calcium sources, such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate), or alginates in gel systems. In meat or sauce formulas, you may also see related lactates like [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate) or [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate).
