# E586 — 4-hexylresorcinol

4-hexylresorcinol helps keep seafood from browning and developing “black spot.” It slows the enzyme that darkens shrimp and other shellfish, so color and quality last longer.

- Also called: 4-hexylresorcinol, 4-Hexyl-1,3-benzenediol; E586
- What it does: Anti-browning (melanosis inhibitor), color stabilizer; mild antimicrobial effects
- Common in: Raw shrimp, prawns, crab, lobster; sometimes used in processing of fresh-cut produce; also an active ingredient in some throat lozenges (drug use)
- Diet flags: Typically synthetic; not animal-derived; vegan/vegetarian friendly; gluten-free

## 1) Why it’s added to food
- It prevents black spot (melanosis) on crustaceans by inhibiting polyphenol oxidase, the browning enzyme.
- This helps seafood look fresh longer and reduces waste during storage and transport.
- It can also modestly slow microbial growth on the surface.

## 2) What foods it’s found in
- Most common: raw or minimally processed seafood such as shrimp, prawns, crab, and lobster.
- Sometimes used during processing of fresh-cut fruits or vegetables to slow browning, though this is less common at retail.
- Shopping tips:
  - Check labels on frozen or thawed shrimp and crab for “4-hexylresorcinol” or “melanosis inhibitor.”
  - If you prefer to avoid it, choose products with simple ingredient lists like “shrimp, water, salt” and no processing aids listed.

## 3) What are its alternatives
- For seafood processors: good icing and temperature control, modified atmosphere packaging, citric or ascorbic acid dips, or sulfites (where permitted and labeled as “Contains sulfites”).
- For home cooking: keep seafood very cold and cook soon after purchase; for cut produce, use lemon juice or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) dips.

## 4) How 4-hexylresorcinol is manufactured
- It is made by chemical synthesis from resorcinol with a six-carbon (hexyl) group added under controlled conditions.
- The result is a purified crystalline powder used in food processing and in some OTC lozenges.

## 5) How safe is 4-hexylresorcinol for consumption?
- Major food safety bodies have evaluated E586 for use as a food additive and set acceptable intake levels based on toxicology data.
- When used as intended and within allowed limits, they have not identified a safety concern.

## 6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- 4-hexylresorcinol is an OTC active in some sore throat lozenges as a local anesthetic/antiseptic.
- This is a drug use, not a food use. Follow the Drug Facts label on lozenges for dosing and age limits.

## 7) When 4-hexylresorcinol may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Avoid if you have a known sensitivity to 4-hexylresorcinol or related phenolic compounds.
- For lozenges containing 4-hexylresorcinol, follow package directions; do not use in young children unless the label allows it.
- If you are pregnant, nursing, or on special diets, follow healthcare guidance and choose products with ingredient lists you are comfortable with.

- Myth: “4-hexylresorcinol is a sulfite.” Fact: It is not a sulfite; it is a phenolic compound and is often used as an alternative to sulfites in seafood. Source: EFSA (europa.eu) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “It dyes shrimp to make them look fresh.” Fact: It does not add color; it slows the enzyme that causes black spotting. Source: JECFA/WHO (who.int) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “It’s an antibiotic in food.” Fact: It has local antiseptic activity but is not an antibiotic; in foods it’s used at low levels as a processing aid. Source: FDA OTC monograph for sore throat lozenges (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor

## 4-hexylresorcinol in Branded Foods
You’ll see it most in raw or frozen shrimp and other crustacean products that state they are treated to prevent melanosis. It may appear in ingredient lists or as a processing note.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) What is E586 — 4-hexylresorcinol used for in foods?  
It prevents black spot on shrimp and other shellfish by slowing browning enzymes. It helps keep the natural color during storage.

2) Is E586 safe to eat regularly?  
Regulators have set safe intake limits and consider it safe when used as permitted. If you prefer to avoid it, choose seafood with simple ingredient lists.

3) Which grocery products usually include 4-hexylresorcinol?  
Mainly raw or frozen shrimp, prawns, crab, or lobster treated to prevent melanosis. Check seafood labels for “4-hexylresorcinol” or “melanosis inhibitor.”

4) Does 4-hexylresorcinol cause any side effects or allergies?  
Reactions are uncommon but possible in sensitive individuals. Stop use and choose untreated products if you notice irritation or sensitivity.

5) What are simple alternatives to 4-hexylresorcinol for home cooking?  
Keep seafood very cold and cook soon after buying. For cut produce, use lemon juice or ascorbic acid to slow browning.
