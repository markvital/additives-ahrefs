## Why is Edible gold added to food?
It’s added to create a gold-colored, high-shine decorative finish on the outside of foods. In the EU, gold (E175) is authorized as a food color specifically for surface decoration in select categories such as confectionery and liqueurs.[^1] When shopping, expect it only on the surface—if a product looks uniformly gold inside and out, check that it’s truly labeled as edible gold.

## What foods contain Edible gold?
You’ll mainly find it on premium treats and certain spirits. Common examples include chocolate truffles with gold leaf, decorated pastries and macarons, sugar dragées or fondant toppers with gold dust, and liqueurs that intentionally contain suspended gold flakes.[^2] Check labels and product descriptions for “gold leaf,” “gold flakes,” or “E175.”

## What can replace Edible gold?
Other decorative options can create sparkle or color without using gold. Consider edible silver leaf like [silver](/e174-silver), colored sugar or sprinkles, cocoa powder or powdered sugar for contrast, or approved food-grade luster dusts from reputable baking suppliers. Each alternative changes the look and cost; silver gives a cooler tone, while colored sugars are more budget-friendly but less metallic.

## How is Edible gold made?
Food-grade gold for E175 is produced as very thin leaf or fine powder from high-purity metallic gold, then applied to food surfaces. In the EU, specifications define its identity as metallic gold and set strict purity and impurity limits, ensuring it’s suitable for decorative food use.[^3] When buying, choose products labeled as food-grade gold leaf or dust from trusted suppliers.
