Edible gold (E175) is the thin, metallic gold used to decorate foods and drinks. It adds a reflective, luxury look but has no flavor and almost no nutritional effect. In regulated uses, it is applied to the surface of foods in tiny amounts.

## At a glance
- What it is: Real metallic gold used as leaf, flakes, or powder for food decoration.
- What it does: Provides a shiny, reflective appearance; it does not change taste or texture.
- Where you’ll see it: Fancy chocolates, pastries, and sometimes clear liqueurs with visible flakes.
- Regulatory note: In the EU, E175 is a permitted color additive for surface decoration under strict purity rules and defined uses.
- Other names: Edible gold, E175, Pigment Metal 3.

## Why is Gold added to food?
Food makers use gold to create a premium, celebratory look. In the European Union, gold (E175) is authorized as a color additive specifically for decorating the surface of foods, and it may be used under “quantum satis,” meaning only as much as needed for the intended effect and following the legal conditions of use.[^1]

## What foods contain Gold?
You’re most likely to find edible gold on high-end confectionery and fine bakery wares, such as truffles, pralines, macarons, wedding cakes, and special-occasion desserts. It may also appear as flakes in some clear spirits and liqueurs, or as decorative accents on plated dishes in restaurants. In the EU, its authorized uses focus on surface decoration rather than coloring a product throughout, and labels may list it as “E175.”[^1]

## What can replace Gold?
- Silver leaf or flakes: [silver](/e174-silver) (E174) gives a bright metallic look without a golden hue.
- Mineral colors: [iron oxides and iron hydroxides](/e172-iron-oxides-and-iron-hydroxides) (E172) can provide gold, yellow, or brown shades in coatings, though not the mirror-like shine of metal leaf.
- Clear, glossy finishes: [shellac](/e904-shellac) (E904) can add shine to confectionery without a metallic appearance.
- Note on titanium dioxide: [titanium dioxide](/e171-titanium-dioxide) (E171) was commonly used to make white or pearly effects but is no longer authorized as a food additive in the EU.[^2]

## How is Gold made?
Edible gold is produced from high-purity gold that is mechanically worked into extremely thin leaf, or milled into flakes and fine powders suitable for food use. The legal product specification (including forms such as leaf, flakes, and powder, and purity requirements) is set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which lays down the specifications for food additives listed in the EU.[^3]

## Is Gold safe to eat?
Based on available data, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern for E175 at the currently reported uses and use levels in food. Metallic gold is poorly absorbed from the gut, is not genotoxic (does not damage DNA), and is largely excreted unchanged.[^4]

## Does Gold have any benefits?
Edible gold is used for appearance only. It does not add flavor, sweetness, or preservation, and it is not a meaningful source of nutrients.

## Who should avoid Gold?
- People who know they are sensitive to gold or other metals should avoid it.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit exposure to metals should follow that guidance.
- As with any decorative additive, it isn’t necessary in everyday diets; those minimizing ultra-premium or highly decorated sweets will naturally consume less.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Edible gold is absorbed and builds up in the body.” Fact: Metallic gold is minimally absorbed and is mostly excreted.[^4]
- Myth: “Gold adds flavor.” Fact: E175 is neutral in taste; its function is visual.
- Myth: “All shiny decorations are gold.” Fact: Many shiny effects come from other additives, such as [silver](/e174-silver) or glossy coatings like [shellac](/e904-shellac).

## Gold in branded foods
- Liqueurs with floating flakes (for example, certain gold-flake spirits).
- Luxury chocolates, truffles, and pastries that feature gold leaf or dust on the surface.
- High-end restaurant dishes and celebration cakes with small gold accents.
