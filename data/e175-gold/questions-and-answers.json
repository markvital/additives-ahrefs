      "q": "what is the price of gold today",
      "a": "For E175 (edible gold), there isn’t a single daily market price—cost varies by form (leaf, flakes, dust), purity (typically 22–24k), size, and supplier; check baking/decor suppliers for current listings. If you mean bullion gold, refer to a live financial spot-price source.",

      "q": "how much is gold per ounce",
      "a": "Edible gold isn’t usually sold by the ounce; it’s sold as thin leaf or small flake/dust packs priced per sheet or per gram, and the price varies widely by supplier. For the investment ounce price of gold, consult a live spot-price source.",

      "q": "what is the price of gold",
      "a": "For edible-use gold (E175), prices depend on product type, purity, and pack size rather than a single standard price; expect variation between brands and suppliers. For bullion pricing, see live financial market data.",

    {
      "q": "how much is a gram of gold",
      "a": "The gram price of edible gold products depends on purity and presentation and is often higher than bullion spot due to processing and packaging; check food-grade suppliers for current per‑gram costs. For the metal’s spot price per gram, use a live market quote.",
