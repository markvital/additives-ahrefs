Guar gum (E412) is a plant-based thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier made from the seeds of the guar plant. It helps keep foods smooth and uniform by binding water and improving texture at very low use levels. You’ll see it in everything from ice cream and yogurt to sauces and gluten-free baking.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural galactomannan polysaccharide milled from guar bean endosperm
- What it does: Thickens, stabilises, and helps keep oil and water mixed
- Where it’s used: Ice cream, yogurt, sauces, dressings, plant-based milks, and gluten-free foods
- Label names: “Guar gum,” “E412,” or sometimes “guar flour”
- Dietary note: A source of soluble fiber; large amounts may cause gas in some people

## Why is Guar gum added to food?
Food makers use guar gum because a tiny amount can thicken water-based foods, stop ingredients from separating, and improve mouthfeel. It helps prevent ice crystals in frozen desserts, reduces syneresis (water weeping) in sauces and yogurts, and stabilises foams and emulsions. It also works well alongside other gums; for example, blending with [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) boosts viscosity for creamy textures.[^2]

## What foods contain Guar gum?
You can find guar gum in many everyday products. Common examples include:
- Dairy and frozen desserts: ice cream, frozen yogurt, whipped toppings
- Chilled and shelf-stable foods: yogurt, cream cheese spreads, puddings
- Sauces and dressings: salad dressings, gravies, dips, salsas
- Bakery and gluten-free items: breads, tortillas, cakes, cookie doughs
- Plant-based and alternative products: almond/soy/oat drinks, vegan cheeses, meat analogues
- Beverages and mixes: flavored drinks, instant soups, powdered drink mixes

On labels in the EU, it may appear as “E412.” Elsewhere it is typically listed as “guar gum.”

## What can replace Guar gum?
Depending on the recipe and texture target, formulators may use:
- [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for strong thickening and suspension
- [Locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum) for creamy body, often paired with other gums
- [Carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) in dairy systems for gel-like structure
- [Acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) to stabilise flavors and emulsions
- [Tara gum](/e417-tara-gum) as a similar galactomannan with different viscosity profile
- [Pectins](/e440-pectins) for jams, fruit fillings, and some dairy gels
- [Modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch) or [cellulose](/e460-cellulose) where heat or shear stability is needed

## How is Guar gum made?
Guar gum comes from the seeds of the guar plant (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba). After cleaning, the seeds are dehusked and split to remove the endosperm, which is then milled into a fine powder. Food-grade specifications define purity, contaminants, and functional properties such as viscosity, ensuring a consistent, safe ingredient.[^1]

## Is Guar gum safe to eat?
Yes. In the EU, guar gum (E412) is authorised as a food additive with defined purity criteria, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern at reported use levels; an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was “not specified,” which is used for additives of very low toxicity.[^1][^2] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration lists guar gum among permitted food additives and notes its accepted use in foods.[^3]

Like other soluble fibers, guar gum is not digested but is fermented in the large intestine. High amounts may cause gas or bloating in sensitive people, which is a typical response to fermentable fibers rather than a sign of toxicity.[^2]

## Does Guar gum have any benefits?
For food quality, guar gum improves thickness and body, stabilises emulsions, and helps frozen desserts stay smooth by limiting ice crystal growth. For nutrition, it adds soluble fiber and is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids; however, its primary purpose in foods is texture, not health claims.[^2]

## Who should avoid Guar gum?
- Anyone with a confirmed allergy or sensitivity to guar gum should avoid it. While rare, guar gum can contain trace proteins from the guar seed, which are potential allergens.[^2]
- People who are sensitive to fermentable fibers (and experience gas or discomfort) may prefer products with lower gum content.
- Workers handling guar gum powder should minimise dust inhalation; reported reactions are mainly occupational and related to airborne dust, not eating foods.[^2]

If you have a medical condition that requires thickened or restricted-fiber diets, follow your clinician’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Guar gum is synthetic.” Fact: It’s a plant-derived gum milled from guar seeds.[^1]
- Myth: “Guar gum is the same as gluten.” Fact: It’s gluten-free; guar gum is a carbohydrate fiber, not a protein.
- Myth: “All gums gel.” Fact: Guar gum thickens strongly but does not form firm gels on its own; blends with gums like [xanthan](/e415-xanthan-gum) can tailor texture.[^2]

## Guar gum in branded foods
You’ll typically see guar gum on ingredient lists for:
- Ice creams and frozen desserts to keep texture smooth
- Spoonable yogurts and dairy desserts for creaminess and stability
- Sauces and dressings to prevent separation
- Gluten-free breads and tortillas to improve structure
- Plant-based milks to keep particles suspended

Labels may show “guar gum,” “E412,” or both, depending on the market and brand style.
