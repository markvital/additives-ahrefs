      "q": "how does the body make riboflavin 5 phosphate",
      "a": "The enzyme riboflavin kinase (flavokinase) uses ATP to phosphorylate riboflavin to riboflavin‑5′‑phosphate (FMN), which can then be further converted to FAD by FAD synthetase.",

      "q": "riboflavin 5 phosphate 50mg/ml how to use",
      "a": "As a food fortificant/color, a 50 mg/mL R5P solution (sodium salt) provides roughly 39–40 mg/mL of riboflavin equivalents, so adding about 0.025 mL delivers ~1 mg B2 per serving; protect from light and follow manufacturer instructions and local regulatory limits.",
