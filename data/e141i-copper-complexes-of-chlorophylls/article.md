# E141i — Copper complexes of chlorophylls

Copper complexes of chlorophylls (E141i) are green food colors made by binding copper to natural chlorophyll from plants. They give foods a deep, stable green when plain chlorophyll would fade with heat, light, or acid.

## At a glance
This section gives a quick picture of what E141i does and where you might find it.

- What it is: a green color made from plant chlorophyll with copper at its center; also called copper chlorophylls or CI Natural Green 3.
- What it does: colors foods green and resists fading during cooking, storage, or in acidic foods.
- Solubility: fat‑soluble (unlike the water‑soluble [copper complexes of chlorophyllins](/e141ii-copper-complexes-of-chlorophyllins)).
- Typical foods: confectionery, desserts, sauces, ice cream, and preserved vegetables.
- On labels: “E141,” “E141i,” “copper chlorophylls,” or “copper complexes of chlorophylls.”
- Regulatory status: authorized as a food color in the European Union; rules and uses can differ by country.

## Why is E141i added to food?
Food makers use E141i to keep a fresh, natural‑looking green. Regular plant chlorophyll turns dull brown when exposed to acid, heat, or oxygen. Replacing magnesium in the molecule with copper creates a more robust color that holds up better in real‑world foods and processing. Compared with plain [chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins), E141i stays greener for longer in many recipes.

## What foods contain E141i?
You’re most likely to see E141i in foods where a bright green is expected and needs to last through heat, acidity, or storage. Common examples include:
- Sweets and confectionery (mint candies, icings, decorative sprinkles)
- Desserts and dairy analogues (ice cream, frozen desserts)
- Sauces, dressings, and condiments (green sauces or dips)
- Preserved or processed vegetables (for a consistent green)
- Snack coatings and bakery decorations

In the EU, E141 (which includes E141i and E141ii) is listed as a permitted color across specific food categories with maximum levels set in law.[^3]

## What can replace E141i?
The best alternative depends on your recipe and whether it is water‑ or fat‑based.
- For water‑based foods: [copper complexes of chlorophyllins](/e141ii-copper-complexes-of-chlorophyllins) can give a similar green.
- For fat‑based foods: plain [chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) or spinach/parsley extracts may work, though color can fade faster.
- For custom greens: blend other colors such as [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) (yellow) with [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf) (blue) to reach the shade you want.

## How is E141i made?
E141i starts with chlorophyll extracted from edible plant material such as grasses or leafy greens. Food‑grade solvents like acetone, ethanol, or hexane may be used to pull the pigments from the plants, following strict purity rules. The central magnesium atom in chlorophyll is then replaced with copper to form “copper chlorophylls,” and the natural fat‑loving parts of the molecule (like phytol chains) are kept, which makes the color fat‑soluble.[^1]

The EU specification sets identity and purity criteria for E141i, including permitted processing aids, residual solvent limits, and copper content ranges to ensure consistent quality and safety.[^1]

## Is E141i safe to eat?
Regulators evaluate E141i as a color additive and set limits to control copper exposure from its use. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated E141 (both E141i and E141ii) and, based on available data and reported use levels, did not identify safety concerns for consumers when used as authorized.[^2] As with many colors, the legal limits are designed to keep intake well within safe bounds.[^3]

## Does E141i have any benefits?
The benefits are technological, not nutritional.
- Color stability: E141i keeps a greener hue under heat, light, and acidic conditions better than plain chlorophyll, which helps foods look appealing for longer.[^2]
- Performance in fats: Because it is fat‑soluble, it colors fatty or oily foods evenly where water‑soluble colors struggle.[^1]

It is not added as a source of vitamins or minerals.

## Who should avoid E141i?
Most people do not need to avoid E141i when it is used as intended. However:
- People with Wilson disease (a rare disorder of copper metabolism) are advised to manage copper intake under medical supervision and should discuss any copper‑containing additives with their healthcare team.[^4]

If you have a specific medical condition or a special diet for copper, ask your clinician or dietitian for personalized guidance.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just chlorophyll.” Not quite. E141i is a copper‑stabilized form of chlorophyll designed for food coloring.
- “Copper makes the food metallic.” The copper is tightly bound within the pigment complex, used in very small amounts set by law.
- “All E141 is the same.” E141 includes two forms: E141i (fat‑soluble copper chlorophylls) and E141ii (water‑soluble copper chlorophyllins). They behave differently in recipes.
- “It’s synthetic.” The pigment comes from plant chlorophyll, then is processed to replace magnesium with copper to improve stability.

## E141i in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “copper chlorophylls,” “copper complexes of chlorophylls,” “E141,” or “E141i.” You’ll most often find it in:
- Green candies and decorative toppings
- Ice creams and frozen desserts with mint or pistachio flavors
- Sauces or dressings where a bright green is expected
- Processed vegetables that need to keep an appetizing color

Label wording and where it can be used may differ by market, so products sold in the EU can look different from those in other countries.
