Enzymatically hydrolysed carboxymethylcellulose (E469) is a modified plant fiber used to steady texture and keep mixtures from separating. It is a lower‑viscosity form of [sodium carboxymethylcellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose) (cellulose gum) made by trimming the long cellulose chains with food-grade enzymes.

## At a glance
- What it is: A plant‑derived cellulose gum that has been gently broken down by enzymes to make it easier to disperse and control texture.
- What it does: Acts as a stabiliser and thickener; helps prevent separation and gives a smooth, consistent mouthfeel.
- Where it shows up: Drinks and drinkable dairy, sauces and dressings, fruit preparations, desserts, and other foods that need stable texture.
- Label names you might see: “E469,” “enzymatically hydrolysed carboxymethylcellulose,” or “enzymatically hydrolysed cellulose gum.”
- Related additive: [Sodium carboxymethylcellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose) (E466) is the parent material with higher viscosity.

## Why is E469 added to food?
Manufacturers use E469 to control thickness and keep ingredients evenly mixed. Because its chains are shorter than regular cellulose gum, it disperses quickly, gives fine control of viscosity, and remains stable across a range of temperatures and acidity. This makes it useful in liquids and pourable foods where a heavy, gummy texture is not desired.

## What foods contain E469?
You will most often find E469 in products that need light but reliable stabilising:
- Ready‑to‑drink beverages and flavored milks
- Drinkable yogurts and dairy alternatives
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades
- Fruit preps, fillings, and glazes
- Spoonable desserts and puddings

On ingredient lists it may appear as E469 or by its full name.

## What can replace E469?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and processing conditions:
- [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for strong suspension and pourable textures
- [Guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum) for body in cold systems
- [Pectins](/e440-pectins) for fruit systems and jams
- [Carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) for some dairy textures
- [Sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate) for heat‑stable thickening and gel‑like textures
- [Cellulose](/e460-cellulose) when insoluble fiber or anti‑caking is needed

Each behaves differently, so swaps are rarely 1‑to‑1.

## How is E469 made?
E469 starts with purified cellulose from plant material. The cellulose is first turned into [sodium carboxymethylcellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose) (CMC). Then, food‑grade enzymes (such as cellulases) partially hydrolyse the CMC, shortening its chains to reduce viscosity while keeping the same chemical groups. This “enzymatic hydrolysis” step is defined in the EU additive specifications.[^1]

## Is E469 safe to eat?
EU scientists have reviewed the safety of celluloses, including E469, and found no safety concern at reported uses and levels in food. They did not consider it necessary to set a numerical ADI (acceptable daily intake).[^2] International experts from WHO/FAO (JECFA) have also assigned modified celluloses an ADI “not specified,” reflecting low toxicity at typical use levels.[^3]

In the United States, the closely related parent material, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cellulose gum), is affirmed as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^4] Like other celluloses, E469 is not absorbed intact and is mostly excreted; some portion may be fermented by gut microbes.[^2]

## Does E469 have any benefits?
- Helps keep particles and flavors evenly dispersed in drinks and dressings.
- Adds smooth mouthfeel without making liquids overly thick.
- Improves texture consistency from batch to batch.
- Can help products stay stable through heating, cooling, and mild acidity.

These are functional, in‑food benefits rather than health benefits.

## Who should avoid E469?
Most people can consume E469 without problems. At very high intakes, some individuals may notice digestive effects such as gas, soft stools, or bloating—effects typical of non‑digestible celluloses.[^2] Anyone who finds they are sensitive to cellulose gums in general can choose products without them.

If you follow a healthcare‑directed elimination diet, have a diagnosed intolerance to certain gums, or prefer to avoid additives, check labels and pick simpler formulations.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s plastic.” False. E469 comes from plant cellulose and is modified to be water‑soluble; it is not a plastic.
- “It’s the same as E466.” Partly. E469 is made from E466 but is enzymatically shortened, so it gives lower viscosity and different handling.
- “It adds lots of calories.” No. Like other celluloses, it is not significantly digested and contributes negligible energy in normal use.
- “It contains gluten.” No. Cellulose gums are gluten‑free; they do not come from wheat proteins.

## E469 in branded foods
On EU labels, look for “E469.” Elsewhere you may see “enzymatically hydrolysed carboxymethylcellulose” or “enzymatically hydrolysed cellulose gum.” It often appears alongside other texture agents such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan). If you prefer to avoid it, scan the ingredients list or choose products marketed as “gum‑free.”
