Alpha-tocopherol (E307) is a form of vitamin E used in foods mainly as an antioxidant. It helps protect fats and oils from going rancid, keeping flavors and colors stable while also contributing small amounts of vitamin E to the diet.

## At a glance
- What it is: Alpha-tocopherol is the main dietary form of vitamin E and a fat-soluble antioxidant.
- What it does in food: Slows oxidation, helping oils, snacks, and baked goods stay fresh longer.
- Where it’s found: Common in vegetable oils, spreads, nut butters, cereals, and snacks.
- Safety: Approved in the U.S. and EU when used as intended; issues mainly relate to high-dose supplements, not normal food use.
- Also known as: E307; vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol).

## Why is Alpha-tocopherol added to food?
Food manufacturers use alpha-tocopherol to slow down oxidation—the chemical reaction that makes fats turn rancid and flavors fade. This keeps products tasting fresher for longer and helps stabilize colors in fatty foods.[^2] In the U.S., tocopherols are “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice, which covers the typical antioxidant uses in foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Alpha-tocopherol?
You’ll most often see E307 on labels of foods that contain oils or fats, such as:
- Vegetable oils and oil-based spreads
- Nut butters and roasted nuts
- Baked goods, granola, and cereal bars
- Savory snacks and instant noodles
- Salad dressings and mayonnaise
- Plant-based milks and meal replacements

It may appear on labels as “alpha-tocopherol,” “tocopherols,” or “vitamin E.”

## What can replace Alpha-tocopherol?
Other antioxidants or freshness protectors can fill a similar role, depending on the food:
- Natural options: [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary), [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), and [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate)
- Synthetic antioxidants: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), and [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Helper ingredients that slow oxidation by binding metals: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Related vitamin E sources: [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)

The right substitute depends on the product’s fat type, flavor profile, and shelf-life goals.

## How is Alpha-tocopherol made?
Manufacturers obtain alpha-tocopherol in two main ways:
- From plants: It can be extracted and purified from vegetable oils (such as soybean or sunflower) that naturally contain tocopherols.[^2]
- By synthesis: It can be produced from common starting materials in a controlled process, yielding alpha-tocopherol for food use that meets purity specifications.[^2]

Both routes are standardized so the finished ingredient meets strict identity and purity criteria before it goes into food.[^2]

## Is Alpha-tocopherol safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. affirm tocopherols as GRAS when used according to good manufacturing practice, which is how antioxidants like E307 are typically used in foods.[^1] In the EU, scientists re-evaluated alpha-tocopherol (E307) and related tocopherols and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels as food additives.[^2]

## Does Alpha-tocopherol have any benefits?
Alpha-tocopherol is the main form of vitamin E in the body. It helps protect cells from oxidative damage as part of a balanced diet.[^3] For adults, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 15 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol, and routine food uses of E307 can contribute small amounts toward that goal.[^3]

## Who should avoid Alpha-tocopherol?
- People taking blood thinners (for example, warfarin) or those with bleeding disorders should be cautious with high-dose vitamin E supplements, because large intakes may increase bleeding risk.[^3]
- The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults is 1,000 mg/day of supplemental alpha-tocopherol—far above the tiny amounts used as a food additive, but an important limit for supplements.[^3]

If you have a medical condition or take medicines that affect clotting, talk with your healthcare provider before using high-dose vitamin E supplements.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E307 is synthetic only.” Fact: It can be sourced from plants or made by synthesis; both forms must meet strict purity rules.
- Myth: “Vitamin E in foods is just a preservative.” Fact: It helps protect freshness and also adds small amounts of an essential nutrient.
- Myth: “E306 and E307 are the same.” Fact: E306 is a tocopherol-rich extract; E307 is specifically alpha-tocopherol.

## Alpha-tocopherol in branded foods
On ingredient lists, E307 often appears as “alpha-tocopherol” or “tocopherols (to protect freshness).” You’ll commonly find it in bottled cooking oils, nut butters, cereal and snack bars, chips and crackers, ready-to-eat cereals, dressings, and mayonnaise. Many brands use it when they want a label-friendly antioxidant that helps keep flavors stable in fatty foods.
