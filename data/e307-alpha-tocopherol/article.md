Alpha-tocopherol (E307) is vitamin E used to keep oils and fats from going rancid. It also fortifies foods with vitamin E.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Alpha-tocopherol; Vitamin E; E307
- What it does: Antioxidant that protects fats and colors; nutrient fortifier
- Common in: Cooking oils, nut butters, snack bars, breakfast cereals, margarines/spreads, infant formula, plant-based milks
- Diet flags: Generally vegan and vegetarian; gluten-free; often sourced from soy or other vegetable oils

1) Why it's added to food
- It slows oxidation, which helps keep flavors and colors stable. This extends shelf life for foods with oils and fats.
- It can also add vitamin E to meet nutrition targets in fortified foods.

2) What foods it's found in
- Look for it in vegetable oils, nut and seed butters, granola and snack bars, breakfast cereals, and shelf-stable snacks.
- It also appears in margarines/spreads, plant-based milks, infant formulas, and some refrigerated doughs.
- Check labels for “alpha-tocopherol,” “vitamin E,” or “tocopherols (to preserve freshness).”

3) What are its alternatives
- Mixed tocopherols (E306) from vegetable oils are common.
- Ascorbic acid/ascorbyl palmitate, citric acid, and rosemary extract are other antioxidants used to protect fats.
- Brands may also use packaging controls like nitrogen flushing or oxygen absorbers.

4) How Alpha-tocopherol is manufactured
- It can be purified from vegetable oil distillates (such as from soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed oil).
- It can also be made synthetically by combining trimethylhydroquinone with isophytol, then refining the product.
- Some products use natural (d‑alpha‑tocopherol) and others use synthetic (dl‑alpha‑tocopherol) forms. Both act as vitamin E.

5) How safe is Alpha-tocopherol for consumption?
- It is widely accepted as safe when used as an antioxidant in foods. U.S. regulations list tocopherols as GRAS when used in line with good manufacturing practice.

- The EU re‑evaluated tocopherols (E 306–E 309) and found no safety concern for their use as food antioxidants at authorized levels.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Alpha-tocopherol is vitamin E, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage.
- Supplements are used to treat or prevent vitamin E deficiency, especially in fat‑malabsorption conditions. Food additive amounts are much lower than therapeutic doses.

7) When Alpha-tocopherol may be unsafe (contraindications)
- High-dose vitamin E supplements can increase bleeding risk and interact with blood thinners. Avoid high-dose supplements unless advised by a healthcare professional.
- People with soy avoidance can choose products labeled “soy‑free” if concerned about source. Food-grade tocopherol from vegetable oils is highly refined and typically contains negligible protein.
- If you manage a specific medical condition (e.g., clotting disorders), talk to a clinician about vitamin E supplements. Normal food use is generally safe.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Alpha-tocopherol in foods is unsafe because it’s a preservative.” Fact: It is vitamin E acting as an antioxidant and is GRAS when used as intended. Source: FDA eCFR (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “All alpha-tocopherol is synthetic.” Fact: It can be natural (d‑alpha) or synthetic (dl‑alpha); both are authorized when used correctly. Source: EFSA (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “Eating foods with alpha-tocopherol gives you high‑dose vitamin E side effects.” Fact: Additive levels in foods are low; most risks come from high‑dose supplements. Source: NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (URL to be added by editor)

Alpha-tocopherol in Branded Foods
- You’ll see it in national and store brands of oils, nut butters, granola and snack bars, breakfast cereals, and margarines/spreads. Many labels say “tocopherols (to preserve freshness)” or “vitamin E.”

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is alpha-tocopherol the same as vitamin E?
  - Yes. Alpha-tocopherol is the main form of vitamin E used by the body. Labels may list it as “vitamin E,” “alpha-tocopherol,” or “tocopherols.”
- Why is alpha-tocopherol added to oils and snacks?
  - It helps prevent rancidity and keeps flavors stable. This protects the product during storage.
- Is alpha-tocopherol safe to eat every day?
  - In foods, it is considered safe at typical use levels. Most safety concerns relate to high-dose supplements, not normal food amounts.
- Is alpha-tocopherol vegan and gluten-free?
  - Yes, it is usually sourced from plant oils and contains no gluten. Softgel supplements may use gelatin, but that does not affect foods.
- Does alpha-tocopherol come from soy or GMOs?
  - It often comes from soy or other vegetable oils; source varies by brand. If you avoid soy or GMOs, look for “soy‑free” or “non‑GMO” on labels.
