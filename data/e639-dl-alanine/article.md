DL-alanine (E639) is the racemic form of the amino acid alanine used as a flavor enhancer and flavoring in foods. It brings a light, natural sweetness and helps round out savory or acidic notes without adding much taste of its own. On labels you may see it listed as DL-alanine or E639.

## At a glance
- DL-alanine is a 1:1 mixture of the D- and L- forms of the amino acid alanine.
- It is used mainly as a flavor enhancer or flavoring to soften sharp tastes and support sweetness or umami.
- You may find it in seasonings, beverages, soups, sauces, and confectionery.
- It is typically manufactured by chemical synthesis and used in very small amounts.
- Label names: DL-alanine, E639.

## Why is DL-alanine added to food?
Food makers add DL-alanine to improve flavor in a gentle way. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has evaluated alanine (including DL-alanine) as a flavoring agent in foods.[^1] In the European Union (EU), DL-alanine is assigned the code E639 and appears on the Union list of approved food additives.[^2] In the United States (US), it is permitted as a synthetic flavoring substance when used in line with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), which means the minimum amount needed to achieve the intended flavor effect.[^3]

## What foods contain DL-alanine?
You are most likely to see DL-alanine in flavored foods where a soft sweetness or “rounding” of taste is wanted. In the US, it may be added to foods as a flavoring substance, provided it is used according to GMP.[^3] In the EU, E639 is authorized only in the food categories and conditions listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^2] On ingredient lists, look for “DL-alanine” or “E639.”

## What can replace DL-alanine?
Other flavor enhancers can serve similar roles, depending on the recipe:
- For mild sweetness and smoothing: [glycine](/e640i-glycine)
- For umami boost: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate)
- For savory depth in combination: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), or [calcium diglutamate](/e623-calcium-diglutamate)

## How is DL-alanine made?
DL-alanine is the racemic (50:50) mixture of the two mirror-image forms of alanine, defined as a food additive with specific purity criteria in EU specifications.[^4] Commercially, the racemic form is commonly produced by chemical synthesis; a typical route is the Strecker synthesis from an aldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide, followed by hydrolysis.[^5]

## Is DL-alanine safe to eat?
Based on its evaluation as a flavoring agent, JECFA concluded there is “no safety concern” for alanine (including DL-alanine) at current levels of use in food.[^1] In the EU, E639 must meet identity and purity criteria set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which also limits impurities.[^4] In the US, its permitted use as a flavoring substance is regulated under FDA rules and limited by GMP, meaning only small amounts are used.

## Does DL-alanine have any benefits?
From a food technology view, DL-alanine can help mask harsh notes, smooth acidity or saltiness, and add a slight sweetness, giving formulators fine control over taste.[^5] These functions can help keep flavors balanced without introducing a strong new flavor.

## Who should avoid DL-alanine?
Most people do not need to avoid DL-alanine because the amounts used are very small. If you have a medical condition that requires a protein- or amino acid–restricted diet, ask a healthcare professional about your specific needs. Foods for infants and very young children also follow stricter additive rules in many places, so E639 is uncommon in those products.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “DL-alanine is the same as MSG.”  
  Fact: They are different compounds. DL-alanine is an amino acid flavoring; MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and a well-known umami enhancer.
- Myth: “E-numbers are always unsafe.”  
  Fact: An E-number means the additive was evaluated and authorized in the EU with conditions of use.
- Myth: “DL-alanine adds a strong flavor.”  
  Fact: It works subtly, mainly smoothing and rounding existing flavors.

## DL-alanine in branded foods
You may see DL-alanine in ingredient lists for seasonings, powdered drink mixes, confectionery, soups, or sauces. Look for “DL-alanine” or “E639.” Because it is used at low levels for fine flavor tuning, it may not be present in many everyday products, and some brands may prefer alternatives like [glycine](/e640i-glycine) or [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate).
