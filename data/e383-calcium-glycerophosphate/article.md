Calcium glycerophosphate (E383) is a calcium- and phosphorus-containing food additive. It is used mostly to help control acidity in foods and to supply small amounts of calcium and phosphorus as nutrients. It appears on labels as “calcium glycerophosphate” or “E383” in the European Union.

## At a glance

- Other names: E383, calcium glycerophosphate
- What it does: helps regulate acidity (buffer), stabilizes formulations, and can add calcium and phosphorus
- Where you might see it: some fortified foods and drinks, powdered mixes, and chewing gum or mint tablets
- Chemistry: the calcium salt of glycerophosphoric acid (a mix of alpha- and beta-isomers)
- Labeling: listed by name; in the EU it may also appear as “E383”

## Why is calcium glycerophosphate added to food?

Food makers use calcium glycerophosphate because it can help keep a product’s acidity (pH) steady over shelf life. That buffering action can protect flavor and texture. It can also serve as a source of two essential minerals—calcium and phosphorus—when a product is fortified. In tablets, gums, and powdered mixes, it also mixes well and supports stable formulations.

A buffer is a substance that helps resist changes in pH when an acid or base is added. In foods, stable pH can support consistent taste and reduce unwanted reactions.

## What foods contain calcium glycerophosphate?

You may find calcium glycerophosphate in:
- Fortified drinks or powdered beverage mixes
- Nutrition powders and meal replacements
- Chewing gum and compressed mint tablets
- Some dairy alternatives and confectionery

On ingredient lists, look for “calcium glycerophosphate” or, in the EU, “E383.” Actual use varies by brand and country rules.

## What can replace calcium glycerophosphate?

Possible substitutes depend on why it’s used:
- For calcium fortification: [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate), [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates), [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate), or [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride)
- For acidity control: citrate salts such as [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates), phosphate salts like [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates), or organic acids such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

Formulators choose among these based on taste, solubility, label goals, and local regulations.

## How is calcium glycerophosphate made?

Calcium glycerophosphate is the calcium salt of glycerophosphoric acid and is typically a mixture of alpha- and beta-glycerophosphate isomers. It is manufactured to meet purity specifications set by the European Union for food additives, which define its identity and composition.[^1]

## Is calcium glycerophosphate safe to eat?

In the European Union, calcium glycerophosphate is an authorized food additive (E383) and must meet strict identity and purity criteria before use in foods.[^1] As a source of calcium and phosphorus, it contributes minerals the body needs for normal function. However, like any source of these nutrients, total intake from food and supplements should not exceed recommended levels.[^2]

Too much calcium from combined sources can cause problems such as kidney stones or interfere with absorption of other minerals in some people.[^2] High phosphorus intake can be an issue, especially for people with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys help regulate phosphorus balance.[^3]

## Does calcium glycerophosphate have any benefits?

- Mineral supply: It provides calcium and phosphorus. Calcium supports bone and teeth, muscle function, nerve signaling, and blood clotting; phosphorus helps form bones and teeth and is involved in energy metabolism.[^2][^3]
- Formulation help: As a buffering agent, it can help keep product acidity steady, supporting taste and stability.

Any health “benefit” comes from the minerals themselves; calcium glycerophosphate is simply one vehicle that provides them in certain foods.

## Who should avoid calcium glycerophosphate?

- People on low-phosphorus diets, such as many with chronic kidney disease, should monitor sources of phosphorus, including phosphate-containing additives, under medical guidance.[^3]
- Those with a history of kidney stones or who take high-dose calcium supplements should discuss total calcium intake with a healthcare professional.[^2]

If you have a medical condition affecting mineral balance, ask your clinician or dietitian before using foods heavily fortified with calcium and phosphorus.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “E-numbers are unsafe chemicals.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is approved for use in the European Union under food additive legislation; it must meet specifications and conditions of use.[^4]
- Myth: “Calcium glycerophosphate is the same as glyphosate.” Fact: They are unrelated substances with different chemistry and uses.
- Myth: “E383 is a sweetener.” Fact: Calcium glycerophosphate is not a sweetener; it is used mainly for buffering and mineral fortification.

## Calcium glycerophosphate in branded foods

On packaging, look for “calcium glycerophosphate” in the ingredient list. In EU countries, you may also see the code “E383.” Outside the EU, E-numbers are typically not used, and the ingredient appears by name.[^4]
