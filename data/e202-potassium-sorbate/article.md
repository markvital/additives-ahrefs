Potassium sorbate (E202) is a common preservative that helps stop yeast and mold from growing in foods and drinks. It has a neutral taste, dissolves well in water, and works best in mildly acidic foods. Most food safety agencies consider it acceptable when used as intended.

## At a glance
- E-number: E202; function: preservative
- What it does: slows yeast and mold growth
- Where it appears: cheeses, baked goods, beverages, fruit products, sauces, wine
- Why it’s used: effective at low doses, neutral taste, good water solubility
- Solubility: more soluble than [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid)
- Works best at lower pH (more acidic foods)
- Regulatory view: permitted in the U.S. and EU within set conditions
- Dietary notes: vegan- and vegetarian-suitable; not made from animal sources

## Why is Potassium sorbate added to food?
Food makers add potassium sorbate to keep products fresh longer by preventing yeast and mold from growing. It’s especially useful in foods that have some moisture and sugar, where spoilage can start quickly. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sorbic acid and potassium sorbate as “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice (GMP). GMP means using the minimum amount needed to do the job.[^1]  
It is chosen over plain [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) when easy, fast dissolving is needed. The preservative works best in mildly acidic foods and is most active against yeasts and molds rather than most bacteria.[^2]

## What foods contain Potassium sorbate?
You’ll commonly see it in:
- Cheeses and cheese spreads
- Baked goods, tortillas, and pastries
- Fruit fillings, jams, jellies, and syrups
- Soft drinks, juices, flavored waters, and teas
- Wine and cider
- Dried fruit, pickles, sauces, and salad dressings

These are typical categories where potassium sorbate is permitted and reported for use in the EU, which mirrors how it’s used widely worldwide.[^2]

## What can replace Potassium sorbate?
Depending on the food and the kind of spoilage you’re trying to control, alternatives include:
- Other sorbates or acids: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) and, where permitted, [calcium sorbate](/e203-calcium-sorbate)
- Benzoates for acidic foods: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), [potassium benzoate](/e212-potassium-benzoate)
- In baked products: [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate)
- Natural antimicrobials for specific uses: [natamycin](/e235-natamycin) and [nisin](/e234-nisin) on certain cheeses and meats
- Process changes: lower pH with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), add antioxidants like [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), reduce water activity (drying), use pasteurization, or improve packaging

No single substitute fits every recipe; food makers often combine methods to match taste, texture, and shelf-life goals.

## How is Potassium sorbate made?
Potassium sorbate is the potassium salt of sorbic acid. It is produced by neutralizing purified sorbic acid with potassium hydroxide (often abbreviated KOH), then drying the product to a stable powder or granules. Industrial sorbic acid itself is typically made by reacting crotonaldehyde with ketene before purification, after which it is converted to potassium sorbate.[^3]

## Is Potassium sorbate safe to eat?
In the U.S., the FDA lists sorbic acid and potassium sorbate as GRAS when used according to good manufacturing practice, meaning manufacturers should use only as much as needed for the intended effect.[^1] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated sorbic acid (E200) and potassium sorbate (E202) and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels permitted in the EU.[^2] As with any preservative, regulators also set rules for where and how much can be used in different foods.

ADI stands for Acceptable Daily Intake. It is a scientific estimate of the daily amount of a substance that can be consumed over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. Regulators use ADIs, along with how much people actually eat, to check that typical diets stay within safe bounds.

## Does Potassium sorbate have any benefits?
- Helps keep foods fresher for longer by holding back mold and yeast
- Supports consistent flavor and texture over shelf life
- Can reduce food waste by slowing spoilage
- Works at low levels and doesn’t bring noticeable taste on its own
- Dissolves quickly, making it easy to blend into drinks and syrups

## Who should avoid Potassium sorbate?
- Individuals with a known sensitivity to sorbates should avoid it.
- People advised to follow a potassium-restricted diet (for example, some with kidney conditions) may prefer to check with a healthcare professional. The amount of potassium contributed at typical use levels is small, but personal limits can vary.
- Bakers should avoid adding it before yeast fermentation in dough, because it can slow or stop yeast activity.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as potassium bromate.” Fact: They are different additives with different uses. Potassium sorbate is a preservative; potassium bromate is a flour improver with separate safety rules.[^1]
- Myth: “Preservatives always make food unsafe.” Fact: Potassium sorbate is permitted by major regulators, who limit where and how much can be used to keep overall diets within safe ranges.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “It kills all microbes.” Fact: It mainly targets yeasts and molds and works best in acidic foods; it is less effective against many bacteria.[^2]

## Potassium sorbate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll usually see “potassium sorbate” sometimes followed by “(preservative)” or “(to maintain freshness).” It often appears alongside acidity regulators and antioxidants to support overall shelf life. Typical products include shredded cheese, tortillas, fruit fillings, juices, iced teas, flavored waters, wines, salad dressings, dips, and some refrigerated desserts.
