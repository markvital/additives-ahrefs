Karaya-gum (E416) is a plant gum taken from Sterculia trees. It is used in foods as a thickener, stabiliser, and sometimes as an emulsifier to improve texture and hold water. It’s considered suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural tree exudate (gum) from Sterculia species, milled into a food-grade powder
- What it does: Thickens, stabilises, and helps keep mixtures uniform
- Common in: Sauces and dressings, confectionery, desserts, and some bakery fillings
- Dietary notes: Plant-based, gluten-free, low in calories
- Safety: Authorised for use in the EU; like other gums, large amounts may cause gas or bloating in sensitive people
- Alternatives: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [agar](/e406-agar), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [pectins](/e440-pectins)

## Why is Karaya-gum added to food?
Food makers use karaya for its strong water-binding and thickening power. It builds body in liquids, helps suspended pieces stay evenly mixed, reduces syneresis (weeping) in gels and fillings, and can stabilise emulsions like oil-and-water dressings.[^3] In the EU it is authorised as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier under the additive code E416.[^2]

## What foods contain Karaya-gum?
You may find karaya gum in:
- Salad dressings and sauces
- Confectionery and chewing gum
- Fruit preparations, dessert toppings, and dairy-style desserts
- Bakery fillings and glazes
- Some reduced-fat or reduced-sugar products for texture

Its permitted uses in Europe are set out in the EU’s food additives regulation (Annex II), which lists where and how E416 may be used.[^2]

## What can replace Karaya-gum?
Depending on the recipe and desired texture, common swaps include:
- Other plant gums: [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [tragacanth](/e413-tragacanth), [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)
- Microbial or seaweed gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [agar](/e406-agar)
- Fruit pectin systems: [pectins](/e440-pectins)

Each thickener behaves a bit differently. For example, xanthan builds viscosity in cold liquids, locust bean works best with heat and often in blends, and pectin gels in the presence of acid and sugar.

## How is Karaya-gum made?
Karaya gum is collected by tapping Sterculia trees so that the sap exudes and hardens; the dry “tears” are then harvested, cleaned, sorted, and milled into powder. Food-grade material must meet identity and purity specifications set by the European Union, including limits for moisture, ash, microbial quality, and contaminants.[^1]

## Is Karaya-gum safe to eat?
E416 is authorised for use in the European Union, which means it has undergone safety evaluation and has defined conditions of use.[^2] As with other non-digestible gums, very high intakes may cause temporary gastrointestinal effects such as gas, soft stools, or bloating in sensitive individuals. People who handle the dry powder occupationally can become sensitised to gum dust; this is not typical for ordinary dietary exposure.[^3]

## Does Karaya-gum have any benefits?
From a technical standpoint, karaya helps foods feel thicker and creamier, improves stability during storage, and can reduce syneresis in fillings and gels. Because it is not digested like starch or sugar, it can add texture with little calorie impact.

## Who should avoid Karaya-gum?
- Anyone with a known allergy or sensitivity to karaya or Sterculia-derived gums
- People who find that gums or added fibres trigger digestive discomfort; start with small amounts and monitor tolerance
- Those on advice from a healthcare professional to limit certain thickeners

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Karaya gum is synthetic.” Fact: It is a natural exudate from Sterculia trees.[^1]
- Myth: “All gums work the same.” Fact: Different gums have different textures and conditions where they work best; karaya is particularly good at water binding but may need partners for strong gels.
- Myth: “Karaya gum is banned in the EU.” Fact: E416 is authorised in the EU with specifications and permitted uses.[^2]

## Karaya-gum in branded foods
You might see E416 on labels of salad dressings, packet sauces, fruit-on-the-bottom yogurts and dairy-style desserts, sugar-free or reduced-sugar sweets, and some bakery fillings. On ingredient lists it can appear as “E416,” “gum karaya,” or “sterculia gum.”
