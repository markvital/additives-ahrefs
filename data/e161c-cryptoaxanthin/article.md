E161C (Cryptoaxanthin), also called beta-cryptoxanthin, is an orange-yellow carotenoid found naturally in citrus and other orange fruits. It can act as a colorant in theory and is a provitamin A, but its use as a food color additive is limited and not widely authorized in major markets.

## At a glance
- Also known as cryptoxanthin or beta-cryptoxanthin, a member of the carotenoid family that gives orange tones.
- Occurs naturally in tangerines, oranges, papaya, and other orange fruits and vegetables.
- Intended function: coloring foods orange-yellow; it can also serve as a provitamin A when eaten as part of foods.
- Regulatory status is limited; in many regions you will rarely see E161C on ingredient lists.
- If used, it may appear on labels as “E161C,” “cryptoaxanthin,” or “beta-cryptoxanthin.”

## Why is Cryptoaxanthin added to food?
Cryptoaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid that imparts orange to yellow color, which can brighten the appearance of foods and drinks. It is also a provitamin A carotenoid that the body can convert to vitamin A, so it can contribute to vitamin A intake when consumed in foods.[^1]

However, its use as a color additive is not broadly authorized. In the United States, cryptoxanthin does not appear on FDA’s lists of color additives permitted for use in foods.[^2] In the European Union, E161C is not on the Union list of authorized food additives according to the European Commission’s public Food Additives Database.[^3]

## What foods contain Cryptoaxanthin?
- Naturally occurring: Citrus fruits (especially tangerines and oranges), papaya, pumpkin, and other orange fruits and vegetables are notable sources of beta-cryptoxanthin.[^4]
- As an additive: Because authorization is limited, it is rarely listed as E161C on food labels in many markets. When present, it is more often part of natural ingredients (such as fruit purees or extracts) rather than an added color.

## What can replace Cryptoaxanthin?
Food makers commonly reach for other orange-yellow colorants that are widely used:
- [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene)
- [lutein](/e161b-lutein)
- [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin)
- [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto)
- the broader class of [carotenoids](/e160-carotenoids)

The choice depends on the desired shade, clarity, solubility, and local regulations.

## How is Cryptoaxanthin made?
Cryptoaxanthin occurs naturally in plant materials, especially citrus. In principle, a food-grade ingredient could be produced by extracting and purifying the pigment from suitable fruit or plant sources. That said, there are currently no widely used EU or U.S. food-additive specifications for E161C, which helps explain why it is uncommon on labels in those markets.[^3]

## Is Cryptoaxanthin safe to eat?
When consumed as part of normal foods (for example, oranges or papaya), beta-cryptoxanthin is considered safe and can contribute to vitamin A nutrition. Like other carotenoids, high intakes from foods or supplements can sometimes cause a harmless yellowing of the skin (carotenodermia) and do not cause vitamin A toxicity.[^4]

As a standalone color additive, Cryptoaxanthin is not listed for routine use in foods by the FDA in the United States,[^2] and it is not on the EU’s Union list of authorized food additives,[^3] so safety for widespread additive use has not been established by those authorities.

## Does Cryptoaxanthin have any benefits?
Yes—beta-cryptoxanthin is a provitamin A carotenoid. The body can convert it into vitamin A, which supports normal vision, immune function, reproduction, and skin integrity when consumed in adequate amounts as part of the diet.[^1]

## Who should avoid Cryptoaxanthin?
- People with allergies or sensitivities to citrus or specific fruit extracts should check ingredient lists carefully.
- Anyone under medical advice to limit carotenoid supplements should follow their clinician’s guidance.
- As an added color, availability is restricted in many regions; consumers seeking only approved additives in their country may prefer products that use authorized alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-number means it’s approved everywhere.” Fact: E-numbers are identifiers used in Europe, but not all codes are currently authorized; E161C does not appear on the EU Union list in the Commission’s database.[^3]
- Myth: “Cryptoaxanthin is the same as beta-carotene.” Fact: They are different carotenoids; both can provide orange color and can act as provitamin A, but they are distinct compounds with different approvals and specifications.

## Cryptoaxanthin in branded foods
Because authorization is limited, mainstream packaged foods in the U.S. and EU seldom list E161C or cryptoxanthin as an added color. If you do see it, it will likely be in niche markets or appear naturally via fruit-based ingredients rather than as a separate additive.
