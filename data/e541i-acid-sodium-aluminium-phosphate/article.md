Acid sodium aluminium phosphate (E541i) is a common leavening acid used in baking powders and mixes. It also helps stabilize and emulsify foods like processed cheese. Look for it on labels as “sodium aluminum phosphate” or “E541i.”

At a glance
- Also called / E-number: E541i; Acid sodium aluminium phosphate; sometimes labeled “sodium aluminum phosphate (acidic)”
- What it does: Leavening acid; emulsifier; stabiliser/thickener
- Common in: Baking powder, self-rising flour, biscuit and pancake mixes, cakes, frozen bakery, processed cheese slices and spreads
- Diet flags: Typically vegan and gluten-free by itself; check the full product for allergens

1) Why it’s added to food
- It releases carbon dioxide with baking soda to make batter rise evenly, especially during baking (“oven spring”). This gives lighter texture and good crumb.
- It also helps emulsify and stabilize certain foods, such as processed cheese.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Baking powders and self-rising flour.
- Dry mixes: pancakes, waffles, biscuits, muffins, cake mixes.
- Ready-to-bake or refrigerated doughs.
- Frozen bakery items and breakfast foods.
- Processed cheese slices, spreads, and sauces.
- Shopping tip: Check ingredient lists for “sodium aluminum phosphate,” “acid sodium aluminium phosphate,” or “E541i.”

3) What are its alternatives
- For baking: cream of tartar, monocalcium phosphate (MCP), sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), glucono delta-lactone (GDL), or citric acid paired with baking soda.
- For yeast-raised breads: yeast or sourdough.
- For processed cheese emulsification: sodium phosphates (e.g., sodium phosphate, disodium phosphate), depending on recipe.
- Shopping tip: Look for “aluminum-free” baking powders if you want to avoid aluminum-based acids.

4) How Acid sodium aluminium phosphate is manufactured
- It is made by reacting food-grade sources of sodium, aluminum, and phosphate under controlled pH and temperature.
- The solid is then filtered, dried, and milled to a consistent particle size for food use.
- Food-grade specifications limit impurities and define performance in baking.

5) How safe is Acid sodium aluminium phosphate for consumption?
- U.S. and international bodies allow its use within set limits. Aluminum exposure from all sources should stay within health-based guidelines.
- It must be used as intended in foods, and manufacturers control levels in recipes.

- { "source": "EFSA (aluminium in food additives; TWI)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Sets a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for aluminum of 1 mg/kg body weight; use of aluminum-containing additives, including sodium aluminium phosphate, should keep exposure below this level." }

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It is a processing aid and leavening acid, not a nutrient. It does not provide health benefits by itself.
- It can improve baking performance and texture in foods.

7) When Acid sodium aluminium phosphate may be unsafe (contraindications)
- People advised to limit aluminum intake (for example, certain kidney conditions) should check labels and may choose aluminum-free baking powders. Ask a healthcare professional if you have a kidney disorder.
- Those on low-sodium or low-phosphorus diets should review ingredient lists and nutrition facts for total sodium and phosphorus from all sources.
- Infants and toddlers should avoid excessive aluminum exposure; choose foods appropriate for age.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “All baking powders contain aluminum.” Fact: Many baking powders are aluminum-free (they use acids like MCP or cream of tartar). Source: FDA eCFR food additive permissions (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “Sodium aluminum phosphate in food has been proven to cause Alzheimer’s disease.” Fact: Major food safety bodies have not established a causal link at typical dietary exposures; they regulate overall aluminum intake to remain within safe limits.

- Myth: “Sodium aluminum phosphate is just aluminum metal in food.” Fact: It is a specific phosphate salt; aluminum is bound in a compound with sodium and phosphate and used at controlled levels. Source: JECFA/WHO evaluations of aluminum compounds (URL to be added by editor)

Acid sodium aluminium phosphate in Branded Foods
- You’ll see it in national-brand baking powders, pancake/biscuit mixes, refrigerated doughs, and in processed cheese slices and spreads.
- It also appears in many private-label baking mixes.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) Is E541i (acid sodium aluminium phosphate) safe?
- Yes, regulators allow it in set amounts. It is GRAS in the U.S. when used as intended, and EFSA/JECFA set limits to manage overall aluminum exposure.

2) Does it contain aluminum?
- Yes. It is an aluminum-containing phosphate salt. If you want to avoid aluminum, look for “aluminum-free” baking powder.

3) What does it do in baking?
- It is a slow-acting leavening acid that reacts with baking soda. It helps batter rise in the oven for light texture.

4) How can I avoid it when shopping?
- Choose mixes and baking powders labeled “aluminum-free.” Check ingredient lists and avoid products listing “sodium aluminum phosphate” or “E541i.”

5) Is it vegan and gluten-free?
- The additive itself is mineral-based and gluten-free. Always check the full product for animal-derived ingredients or gluten.
