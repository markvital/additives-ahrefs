Acid sodium aluminium phosphate (E541i) is a food additive used mainly as a leavening acid in baking and as an emulsifying salt in processed cheese. It helps doughs rise evenly with baking soda and supports smooth, sliceable cheese textures. It is authorized for use in both the U.S. and the EU under specific regulations.

## At a glance
- What it is: a mixture of sodium, aluminium, and phosphate salts; the “acid” grade is the version used for leavening in baked goods.
- What it does: acts as a leavening acid with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) in baking; also functions as an emulsifying salt in some processed cheeses.
- Regulatory status: In the U.S., the FDA affirms the acidic form as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, E541 includes two forms (acidic and basic) with set identity and purity specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Why is Acid sodium aluminium phosphate added to food?
Food makers add E541i to control when and how fast carbon dioxide (CO2) is released during baking. When mixed with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate), it creates gas that lifts batters and doughs for a light, even crumb. In processed cheese, sodium aluminium phosphate can help disperse proteins and fat, improving melt and sliceability.

## What foods contain Acid sodium aluminium phosphate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Baking powders and self-rising flours
- Pancake, waffle, biscuit, and cake mixes
- Baked goods made from those mixes
- Some processed and pasteurized process cheeses, where it is an allowed emulsifying salt in U.S. standards of identity[^3]
These uses reflect its roles as a leavening acid in bakery items and an emulsifying salt in certain cheese products.[^1]

## What can replace Acid sodium aluminium phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and goal:
- For baking (aluminum-free options): [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [sodium acid pyrophosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate), or [cream of tartar](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate), used with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate).
- For processed cheese: other approved emulsifying salts such as [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), depending on the standard and desired texture.

## How is Acid sodium aluminium phosphate made?
E541i is manufactured by reacting approved sources of sodium, aluminium, and phosphate to form a defined double salt. It is then dried and milled to a controlled particle size so it performs consistently in food. In the EU, identity and purity criteria (including which forms are permitted) are set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is Acid sodium aluminium phosphate safe to eat?
- United States: The FDA lists the acidic form of sodium aluminum phosphate as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice, which means manufacturers must use no more than needed for the intended effect.[^1]
- European Union: E541 (acidic and basic forms) is authorized with detailed specifications for composition and purity; only material that meets these specs may be used.[^2]
- Aluminum from the diet is poorly absorbed; only a small fraction taken by mouth enters the body, according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).[^4] As with any additive, overall exposure depends on how much of the foods containing it you eat.

## Does Acid sodium aluminium phosphate have any benefits?
- In baking mixes, it helps deliver reliable, even rise and can reduce “bench time” sensitivity in batters and doughs.
- In processed cheese, it can support a smooth, uniform texture that slices and melts predictably.[^3]
These are functional, food-technology benefits rather than nutritional ones.

## Who should avoid Acid sodium aluminium phosphate?
- People with reduced kidney function may be advised to limit aluminum exposure and manage phosphorus intake; speak with a healthcare professional about your overall diet.[^4][^5]
- Anyone on a low-phosphorus diet (for medical reasons) should review all sources of phosphorus in foods and additives with a clinician or dietitian.[^5]
- If you are sensitive to specific phosphate additives, check labels for “sodium aluminum phosphate,” “acid sodium aluminium phosphate,” “E541,” or “E541i.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “If it’s an E-number, it’s unsafe.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is assessed and authorized in the EU with defined specifications and conditions of use.[^2]
- Myth: “Eating it floods the body with aluminum.” Fact: Only a small amount of aluminum from food is absorbed through the gut; most is excreted.[^4]
- Myth: “All phosphate additives are the same.” Fact: There are many phosphate salts (for example, [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid), [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates), [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate)); they perform different roles and have different specifications.

## Acid sodium aluminium phosphate in branded foods
You’re most likely to find it on ingredient lists for:
- Baking powder and self-rising flour
- Pancake, waffle, biscuit, and cake mixes
- Pasteurized process cheese and similar cheese products
On labels it may appear as “sodium aluminum phosphate,” “acid sodium aluminium phosphate,” “E541,” or “E541i.” Check product packaging or a brand’s website ingredient list to confirm.
