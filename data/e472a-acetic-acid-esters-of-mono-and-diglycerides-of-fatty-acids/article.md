Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472a) are food-grade emulsifiers made by attaching small “acetyl” groups to glycerides from edible fats and oils. They help oil and water mix, keep textures stable, and improve freshness in many baked and creamy foods.
They are approved in the EU and permitted in the US under specific conditions for use in food.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made by reacting [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) with acetic acid derivatives.  
- What it does: Helps oil and water mix, stabilises foams and emulsions, and improves dough handling and crumb softness.  
- Where you’ll see it: Breads, buns, tortillas, cakes, whipped toppings, non-dairy creamers, spreads, and some desserts.  
- Status: Authorised in the EU and permitted in the US with defined conditions of use.[^1][^2]

## Why is Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
This additive is used because it is very good at keeping oil and water together. That makes products smooth, even, and stable. In bread and cakes, it helps dough trap gas, so loaves rise well and crumbs stay soft longer. In creams and non-dairy creamers, it helps prevent separation and keeps the texture light and consistent.

## What foods contain Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
You are most likely to find E472a in:
- Yeast-raised bakery items (breads, buns, rolls, tortillas)
- Cakes, muffins, and cake mixes
- Whipped toppings and dessert foams
- Non-dairy creamers and coffee whiteners
- Margarine and spreads
- Frozen desserts and some confectionery

On labels, look for “E472a,” “acetated monoglycerides,” or the full name “acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids.”[^1]

## What can replace Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Depending on the food and the goal, formulators might use:
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) for gentle emulsification
- [Mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) for general emulsifying support
- [Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) to stabilise emulsions and whipping
- [Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) in bakery for volume and crumb
- [Sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids) for delicate emulsions and foams
- [Polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for reducing viscosity in chocolate and some emulsions
- Texture helpers like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) when thickening or stability—not true emulsifiers—are the main need

## How is Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers start with [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) derived from edible fats and oils. They then react these with acetic acid derivatives (commonly acetic anhydride) to add acetyl groups, forming a mixture of acetylated mono- and diglycerides. The result meets identity and purity specifications set in the EU for food additives.[^3] In the US, the product is defined as “acetated monoglycerides” and is permitted for use as an emulsifier under specific conditions.[^1]

## Is Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
E472a is authorised for use in foods across the European Union under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, subject to the rules there.[^2] It must also meet detailed EU identity and purity specifications set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3] In the United States, “acetated monoglycerides” are permitted as a food additive with defined conditions of use in 21 CFR 172.828.[^1]

## Does Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
For food makers and bakers, this emulsifier can:
- Improve dough tolerance and loaf volume in breads and rolls
- Keep creams and toppings from separating
- Help maintain a soft, even crumb in cakes
- Support smooth, stable textures in spreads and creamers

These are technical food-quality benefits, not health claims.

## Who should avoid Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
- Vegans, vegetarians, and people with religious dietary rules may wish to confirm the fat source. The base [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) can be made from edible fats and oils of plant or animal origin, and labels do not always state the source.[^1]  
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit emulsifiers should check labels and discuss options.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just vinegar.”  
  Fact: While it is related to [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), E472a is a modified fat-based emulsifier, not liquid vinegar.
- Myth: “It always tastes sour.”  
  Fact: At normal use levels, it functions as a texture aid and emulsifier and does not make foods taste like vinegar.
- Myth: “It’s the same as E471.”  
  Fact: E472a is made from E471 but adds acetyl groups, which changes how it behaves in doughs, foams, and emulsions.
- Myth: “It can’t be used in the US or EU.”  
  Fact: It is permitted in both regions under their respective rules.[^1][^2]

## Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E472a,” “acetated monoglycerides,” or the full chemical name. You will often see it on breads and rolls, tortillas, cakes and mixes, whipped toppings, coffee creamers, and some spreads and frozen desserts. If you avoid animal-derived ingredients, contact the manufacturer to ask whether the source fats are plant-based.
