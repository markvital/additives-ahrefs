Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides (E472a) help oil and water mix. They keep foods smooth, stable, and less likely to go stale.
You’ll see them in baked goods, whipped toppings, creamers, and spreads. In the U.S., labels may say “acetylated monoglycerides.”

- Also called/E-number: E472a; acetylated monoglycerides; acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids
- What it does: emulsifier, stabilizer, texture improver; helps trap air in foams; slows staling in some breads
- Common in: breads and buns, tortillas, cakes and icings, non-dairy whipped toppings, powdered/ready-to-use creamers, margarine and spreads, dessert mixes
- Diet flags: may be from plant or animal fats; ask the maker or look for “vegan/plant-based.” Gluten-free. Not a top-9 allergen.

1) Why it’s added to food
- It helps mix fat and water so products stay uniform and creamy.  
- It improves volume and foam in whipped toppings and some cakes. It can also help keep bread softer for longer.  
- Shopper tip: On U.S. labels, look for “acetylated monoglycerides” or “acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides.”

2) What foods it’s found in
- Breads, buns, rolls, and tortillas.  
- Cakes, snack cakes, icings, and dessert mixes.  
- Non-dairy whipped toppings and whipped dessert bases.  
- Powdered and liquid coffee creamers.  
- Margarine, spreads, and some frying or bakery fats.  
- Shopper tip: Check ingredient lists on whipped toppings, creamers, and shelf-stable baked goods.

3) What are its alternatives
- Lecithin (soy or sunflower) for general emulsifying.  
- Mono- and diglycerides, distilled monoglycerides, or polyglycerol esters for bakery texture.  
- Enzymes (e.g., amylases) for bread softness.  
- Shopper tip: If you want fewer emulsifiers, look for simpler recipes or “no emulsifiers added” claims.

4) How Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids is manufactured
- Producers esterify food-grade mono- and diglycerides (from edible fats and oils) with acetic acid or acetic anhydride.  
- The result is a mix of acetylated glycerides with small amounts of glycerol, acetic acid, and unreacted mono- and diglycerides.  
- Sources of the original fats can be vegetable or animal. Ask the brand if you need vegetarian or vegan assurance.

5) How safe is Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids for consumption?
- Major regulators have evaluated E472a and related emulsifiers. At typical use levels, they did not find safety concerns.

  - { "source": "EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (EFSA Journal)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Re-evaluated E472a–f and found no safety concern at reported use levels." }
  - { "source": "JECFA/WHO Monographs", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Group ADI ‘not specified’ for certain emulsifiers including acetylated mono- and diglycerides when used as intended." }

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- This additive is for food technology, not health benefits.  
- It may be used in pharmaceuticals as an excipient (emulsifier) to help a product mix well, not for a direct health effect.

7) When Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids may be unsafe (contraindications)
- If you avoid animal-derived ingredients, verify the source of the fats. Choose products labeled vegan or plant-based.  
- Very sensitive individuals may report digestive discomfort from emulsifiers in general, though this is uncommon.  
- As with all additives, follow any personal advice from your healthcare professional if you have specific dietary conditions.

Myths & facts

- Myth: “E472a is the same as DATEM.” Fact: DATEM is diacetyl tartaric acid esters (a different additive, often labeled DATEM/E472e). Source: EFSA (efsa.europa.eu) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “E472a means the product contains dairy.” Fact: E472a comes from fats and oils that can be plant or animal; it is not a milk ingredient. Source: FDA Food Labeling Guidance (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor

Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in Branded Foods
- You’ll see this in non-dairy whipped toppings, powdered creamers, shelf-stable icings, and some breads or tortillas across national and store brands.  
- It also appears in some margarines and bakery fats.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- What is E472a in simple terms?  
It’s an emulsifier called acetylated monoglycerides. It helps oil and water mix and keeps texture stable.
- Is E472a vegan?  
It can be made from plant or animal fats. Look for “vegan/plant-based” on the label or ask the brand.
- Is E472a safe during pregnancy?  
Food-use levels reviewed by major authorities are considered safe for the general population. If you have special dietary needs, ask your healthcare professional.
- Does E472a contain gluten or common allergens?  
No. It is not a top-9 allergen and is gluten-free. Always check the full ingredient list for other allergens in the product.
- What’s the difference between E472a and DATEM?  
E472a is acetic acid esters (acetylated monoglycerides). DATEM is diacetyl tartaric acid esters (E472e) used more for dough strengthening.
