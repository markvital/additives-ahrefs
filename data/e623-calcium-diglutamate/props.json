  "description": "Calcium diglutamate, sometimes abbreviated CDG and also called calcium glutamate, is a compound with formula Ca-C5H8NO4-2. It is a calcium acid salt of glutamic acid. CDG is a flavor enhancer -E number E623- â€” it is the calcium analog of monosodium glutamate -MSG-. Because the glutamate is the actual flavor-enahancer, CDG has the same flavor-enhancing properties as MSG, but without the increased sodium content. As a soluble source of calcium ions, this chemical is also used as a first-aid treatment for exposure to hydrofluoric acid.",
