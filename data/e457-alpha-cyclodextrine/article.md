Alpha-cyclodextrin (E457) is a starch-derived stabilizer and thickener. It helps keep flavors and oils evenly mixed and can reduce bitterness. Look for it on labels as “alpha-cyclodextrin” or “cyclodextrin.”

At a glance
- Also called/E-number: E457; alpha-cyclodextrin; alpha-cyclodextrine (EU spelling)
- What it does: Stabilizer, thickener, flavor encapsulation, helps keep clear drinks from turning cloudy
- Common in: Flavored waters and drink mixes, dairy desserts, sauces and dressings, baked goods, candies, chewing gum, powdered flavors
- Diet flags: Vegan and vegetarian; typically gluten-free (check source if highly sensitive); not a major allergen

1) Why it’s added to food
- It stabilizes flavors and sensitive ingredients, so taste stays consistent over shelf life. It can mask bitterness and keep oils dispersed in clear drinks and sauces.
- It can add a little body to liquids without much sweetness or flavor.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Flavored beverages and powdered drink mixes.
- Sauces, salad dressings, and marinades.
- Dairy desserts (ice cream, yogurt drinks), confectionery, and chewing gum.
- Bakery items and powdered flavor blends. Check labels for “alpha-cyclodextrin” or “cyclodextrin.”

3) What are its alternatives
- If you want to avoid E457, look for products using gum arabic (acacia gum), pectin, xanthan gum, guar gum, or modified food starch.
- For flavor protection, some brands use maltodextrin or spray-dried natural flavors instead.

4) How Alpha-Cyclodextrin is manufactured
- Food starch (often corn or potato; sometimes wheat) is treated with an enzyme called cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase).
- This converts linear starch into ring-shaped molecules; alpha-cyclodextrin is a ring of six glucose units.
- The alpha form is separated from beta and gamma forms by crystallization and purification, then dried to a powder.

5) How safe is Alpha-Cyclodextrin for consumption?
- Major regulators have evaluated alpha-cyclodextrin for use in food. Typical uses in foods are considered safe when used as intended.
- It may be labeled as a soluble carbohydrate or fiber per applicable regulations; always follow serving directions on products.
- Key safety evaluations:

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Alpha-cyclodextrin is a non-sweet, soluble carbohydrate often used as a fiber ingredient. Some studies suggest it may help reduce the rise in blood lipids after a meal that contains fat.
- It is also used in supplements and pharmaceuticals to stabilize active ingredients. Evidence for health outcomes in the general diet is still mixed; follow product directions.

7) When Alpha-Cyclodextrin may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Large amounts may cause gas, bloating, or loose stools, especially if you are sensitive to fibers.
- If you have a history of digestive disorders or fat malabsorption, be cautious with high intakes.
- It can bind some fat-soluble substances. If you take fat-soluble vitamins or certain medicines, ask a healthcare professional about timing and amounts.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Cyclodextrins are artificial sweeteners.” Fact: Alpha-cyclodextrin is not sweet; it is a neutral-tasting carbohydrate used to stabilize flavors. Source: EFSA (europa.eu) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “Alpha-cyclodextrin is the same as beta-cyclodextrin.” Fact: They differ in ring size and properties; food uses and solubility are not identical. Source: JECFA/WHO (who.int) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “If it’s made from wheat, it always contains gluten.” Fact: Highly processed starch derivatives are typically free of gluten protein; labeling rules focus on residual gluten. Source: FDA Gluten-Free Labeling of Foods (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor

Alpha-Cyclodextrin in Branded Foods
- You may see alpha-cyclodextrin in flavored waters, protein or nutrition drinks, chewing gum, candies, and some sauces and dressings. It often appears in ingredient lists as “alpha-cyclodextrin” or “cyclodextrin.”

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- What is alpha-cyclodextrin (E457)?  
It is a ring-shaped carbohydrate made from starch, used as a stabilizer and thickener. It helps protect flavors and keep oils mixed in foods and drinks.

- Is alpha-cyclodextrin safe to eat?  
Yes, major authorities have evaluated it as safe when used as intended in foods. Follow serving directions on products.

- Is it vegan and gluten-free?  
It is plant-derived and generally vegan and vegetarian. It is typically gluten-free, but if you are highly sensitive, contact the maker to confirm the starch source and processing.

- Why do some clear drinks list cyclodextrin?  
It helps keep flavor oils stable without making the drink cloudy. It can also reduce bitterness.

- How can I avoid it?  
Check ingredient lists for “alpha-cyclodextrin” or “cyclodextrin” and choose items using alternatives like gum arabic, pectin, or modified starch.
