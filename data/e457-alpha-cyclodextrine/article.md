Alpha-Cyclodextrine (E457) is a ring-shaped carbohydrate made from starch. In foods, it works mainly as a stabiliser and thickener, helping protect flavors and improve texture. You’ll usually see it on labels as “alpha-cyclodextrin” or “E457.”

## At a glance
- What it is: A cyclic carbohydrate built from glucose, made from starch
- What it does: Stabilises flavors and colors, helps keep oils dispersed, adds body
- Common foods: Drinks, dairy, baked goods, sauces, flavor and vitamin powders
- Label names: Alpha-cyclodextrin, α-cyclodextrin, E457
- Dietary notes: Typically made from plant starch; usually suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets

## Why is Alpha-Cyclodextrine added to food?
Manufacturers use alpha-cyclodextrin to keep delicate flavors and aromas from fading, to help oils and water stay mixed, and to add a light, smooth body to liquids. It can “hold” small, oily or volatile molecules inside its ring, which helps protect them during processing and storage. In simple terms, it helps foods taste the same from the first shelf-life day to the last and improves consistency.

## What foods contain Alpha-Cyclodextrine?
You might find E457 in:
- Flavored waters, energy drinks, and powdered drink mixes
- Yogurts, dairy drinks, and plant-based beverages
- Baked goods, fillings, and dessert toppings
- Sauces, dressings, and emulsified condiments
- Flavor, vitamin, and color preparations used by manufacturers

## What can replace Alpha-Cyclodextrine?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- For stabilising emulsions or flavors: [beta-cyclodextrine](/e459-beta-cyclodextrine) or [gamma-cyclodextrine](/e458-gamma-cyclodextrine)
- For thickening or mouthfeel: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [cellulose](/e460-cellulose), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)
- For encapsulating flavors in powders: [starch sodium octenyl succinate](/e1450-starch-sodium-octenyl-succinate) or [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose)

## How is Alpha-Cyclodextrine made?
Alpha-cyclodextrin is produced from starch using a specific enzyme, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase). After conversion, the product is purified so it meets the official specification for E457 in the European Union.[^1] Chemically, it is a six-glucose ring (a cyclic oligosaccharide) linked by α-1,4 bonds.[^2]

## Is Alpha-Cyclodextrine safe to eat?
In the European Union, alpha-cyclodextrin is an authorised food additive (E457) under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for use in specified foods and amounts.[^3] Its identity and purity criteria (how it must be made and how pure it must be) are set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1] When used as intended, it is considered safe under these regulations.

Like many non-digestible carbohydrates, very high intakes may cause mild digestive symptoms in some people (for example, gas or bloating). Typical food-use levels are well below those amounts.

## Does Alpha-Cyclodextrine have any benefits?
In recipes, E457 helps protect sensitive flavors and aromas, keeps oils evenly dispersed, and can improve smoothness without adding sweetness. It can also help convert liquid flavors and nutrients into stable powders, which makes them easier to use in manufacturing and helps maintain taste over shelf life.

## Who should avoid Alpha-Cyclodextrine?
Most people can consume foods containing E457 without issue. If you have been advised to limit certain carbohydrates, have a diagnosed digestive condition, or are on a medically supervised diet, ask your healthcare professional about whether alpha-cyclodextrin fits your plan. Those with specific ingredient allergies should check the label and contact the manufacturer if they need to know the starch source.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Alpha-cyclodextrin is an artificial sweetener.” Fact: It is not a sweetener; it is a stabiliser/thickener used for texture and flavor protection.
- Myth: “E457 and E459 are the same.” Fact: E457 is alpha-cyclodextrin; [E459 is beta-cyclodextrine](/e459-beta-cyclodextrine). They are related but not identical and can behave differently in foods.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: E457 does not directly preserve food; it helps stabilise ingredients so flavors and textures last as intended.

## Alpha-Cyclodextrine in branded foods
On packaging, look for “alpha-cyclodextrin,” “α-cyclodextrin,” or “E457.” It often appears in ingredient lists for flavored drinks, yogurts and dairy beverages, bakery fillings, sauces, and in the carriers for flavors and vitamins used by many brands.
