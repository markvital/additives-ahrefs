Sodium malates (E350) are the sodium salts of malic acid. They help control acidity, keep flavors steady, and can support moisture in many foods. You may see them on labels as E350, sodium malate, or sodium hydrogen malate.

## At a glance
Here is a quick look at what this additive does and where it appears.
- What it is: sodium salts of malic acid (the fruit acid that gives tartness)
- Main role: acidity regulator and buffer; helps keep taste and pH stable
- Typical foods: soft drinks and juices, jams, candies, baked goods, sauces
- Label names: E350, sodium malate, disodium malate, monosodium malate
- Diet note: adds some sodium to the diet
- Allergen status: not known as a common allergen

## Why is Sodium malates added to food?
Food makers use sodium malates to manage acidity and keep taste consistent over shelf life. They buffer pH (helping products stay in their target acidity range), which protects flavor, color, and texture in foods like fruit drinks and jams.[^2] They are the sodium salts of malic acid, so they bring a gentle, fruit-like tartness that can round out flavors without being as sharp as straight acids.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium malates?
You’ll most often find E350 in:
- Fruit-flavored drinks and syrups
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Candies and chewing gum
- Bakery fillings and pastries
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades

In the EU, E350 is an authorised food additive and may be used in a range of categories according to the conditions set out in Annex II of the food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Sodium malates?
Depending on the recipe, formulators may choose other acidity regulators or acidulants:
- [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) for strong, bright acidity and buffering
- [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for a more pronounced tart, fruity note
- [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid) for very strong acidity with low solubility (useful in dry mixes)
- [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) for milder, dairy-like acidity
- [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) for some confectionery and beverage uses
- For lower sodium, producers may switch to [calcium malates](/e352-calcium-malates) in suitable products

## How is Sodium malates made?
Food-grade sodium malates are produced by neutralising food-grade malic acid with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, then drying and screening the salt to specification.[^1] The EU sets identity and purity rules (including composition and contaminant limits) for E350 to ensure consistent quality.[^1]

## Is Sodium malates safe to eat?
In the European Union, E350 is authorised as a food additive and must meet strict identity and purity specifications before use.[^1] Its use is controlled by the general food additives regulation, which sets conditions for which foods may contain it and at what levels.[^2] In the United States, malic acid—the parent acid of sodium malates—is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as a flavouring agent and adjuvant when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^4]

## Does Sodium malates have any benefits?
For products, sodium malates help:
- Keep acidity steady, which can protect flavor and color in fruit-based foods
- Deliver a smooth, fruit-like tartness without excessive sharpness
- Improve recipe robustness by buffering pH, which can support microbial control when used with other hurdles

These are technological benefits in the food, not health benefits for the consumer.

## Who should avoid Sodium malates?
People who need to limit sodium—for example, those with high blood pressure or certain kidney conditions—should be mindful that sodium malates add to total sodium intake.[^3] If you are following a low-sodium diet, check labels for “E350” or “sodium malate.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E350 is an artificial sweetener.” Fact: Sodium malates are not sweeteners; they regulate acidity and buffer pH.
- Myth: “It’s the same as malic acid.” Fact: It’s the sodium salt of malic acid. It is less tart and mainly used for buffering rather than strong acidification.
- Myth: “All sodium additives taste salty.” Fact: The sodium in E350 contributes sodium to the diet, but the additive’s taste impact is mainly mild tartness and buffering.

## Sodium malates in branded foods
You can spot E350 by reading the ingredient list for “sodium malate,” “sodium hydrogen malate,” or “E350.” It is common in fruit-flavoured drinks, candies, jams, and some bakery fillings. If you’re tracking sodium, compare similar products and choose items that list fewer sodium-based ingredients.
