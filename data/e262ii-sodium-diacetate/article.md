Sodium diacetate (E262ii) is a dry, vinegar-like powder used to keep foods fresh and tangy. It helps stop mold and some bacteria, and also controls acidity. You’ll most often find it in breads, snacks, seasonings, and some meat products.

## At a glance
Here are the quick facts about sodium diacetate.

- What it is: A solid complex made from sodium acetate and acetic acid (the acid in vinegar)
- Main roles: Preservative, acidity regulator, and flavor enhancer with a mild vinegar taste
- Common in: Baked goods, tortillas, snack seasonings, sauces, pickled foods, and some ready-to-eat meats
- Label names: “Sodium diacetate,” “E262(ii),” sometimes grouped under “sodium acetates”
- Typical form: White, free-flowing crystals with a light vinegar aroma

## Why is sodium diacetate added to food?
Food makers use sodium diacetate to keep products safe and stable. It lowers pH (increasing acidity), which slows or stops the growth of many spoilage microbes, and it adds a clean, vinegar-like flavor without adding liquid vinegar. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium diacetate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^1]

## What foods contain sodium diacetate?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Breads, tortillas, and other baked goods
- Dry seasoning blends and snack coatings (for a tangy, salty-vinegar note)
- Pickled vegetables, sauces, and dressings
- Processed meat and poultry products, where it can serve as an antimicrobial for safety and shelf life; the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA FSIS) lists sodium diacetate as a safe and suitable ingredient in certain meat and poultry items under specific conditions[^4]

## What can replace sodium diacetate?
Alternatives depend on why it is used.

- For acidity and tangy taste: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid)
- For preservation: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- For a related acetate option: [sodium acetate](/e262i-sodium-acetate) or the broader group [sodium acetates](/e262-sodium-acetates)

Each substitute has its own flavor, pH effect, and regulatory limits, so food makers choose based on the recipe and rules for that food.

## How is sodium diacetate made?
Sodium diacetate is produced by combining food-grade sodium acetate with food-grade acetic acid in about a 1:1 molar ratio, then drying the mixture to a solid, free-flowing powder. By specification in the European Union, the finished additive contains approximately 39–41% acetic acid bound in the solid complex.[^2]

## Is sodium diacetate safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended. In the U.S., the FDA recognizes sodium diacetate as GRAS at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated acetic acid and its salts, including sodium diacetate (E 260–263), and found no safety concern at authorized uses and levels, concluding there was no need for a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI).[^3]

## Does sodium diacetate have any benefits?
Sodium diacetate helps:
- Extend shelf life by slowing spoilage organisms in breads, snacks, and other foods
- Enhance savory and sour notes without using liquid vinegar
- Improve safety in some ready-to-eat meats when used as an antimicrobial, as acknowledged by USDA FSIS listings for safe and suitable ingredients[^4]

## Who should avoid sodium diacetate?
- People on strict sodium-restricted diets may wish to check labels, since it contributes a small amount of sodium.
- Anyone sensitive to sharp, vinegar-like flavors might prefer products without it.
- As with any additive, individuals who notice intolerance should consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just vinegar.” Partly true. It is made from vinegar’s main acid (acetic acid) and sodium acetate, but it is a solid complex, not liquid vinegar.
- “It’s a harsh synthetic chemical.” Sodium diacetate is made from food-grade acetic acid and a common food salt; both are widely used in foods and are evaluated by regulators for safety.[^1][^3]
- “It causes cancer.” There is no evidence of carcinogenicity at approved uses; EFSA found no safety concern for acetic acid and its salts, including sodium diacetate, at authorized levels.[^3]

## Sodium diacetate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sodium diacetate” or “E262(ii).” It often appears in tortillas and other flatbreads, tangy snack seasonings, pickled items, condiments, and some ready-to-eat meat and poultry products. Exact amounts and uses vary by brand and by country rules.
