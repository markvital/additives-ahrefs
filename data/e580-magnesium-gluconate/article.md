Magnesium gluconate (E580) is a magnesium salt used in foods mainly as a source of magnesium and for mild control of acidity. It is the magnesium salt of gluconic acid and appears on labels as magnesium gluconate or E580.

## At a glance
- Role: mineral fortifier and processing aid for gentle acidity control
- Chemical nature: magnesium salt of gluconic acid
- Typical foods: beverages, fortified dairy and plant milks, cereals, nutrition bars
- Also known as: E580

## Why is Magnesium Gluconate added to food?
Manufacturers use magnesium gluconate to add magnesium to foods and drinks, and in some recipes to help manage a product’s mild acidity. In the European Union (EU), it is an approved food additive listed as E580 with specifications set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1] Its authorization to be used in foods is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives.[^2]

## What foods contain Magnesium Gluconate?
You are most likely to see E580 on labels for:
- Fortified drinks such as flavored waters, sports and electrolyte beverages
- Fortified dairy foods and plant-based milks
- Breakfast cereals and nutrition bars
- Powdered drink mixes and rehydration powders
- Some confectionery and dessert mixes

It may also appear together with related gluconates like [sodium gluconate](/e576-sodium-gluconate), [potassium gluconate](/e577-potassium-gluconate), [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate), or [iron gluconate](/e579-iron-gluconate) when a specific mineral balance is desired.

## What can replace Magnesium Gluconate?
Possible alternatives depend on the job it is doing:
- To add magnesium: [magnesium chloride](/e511-magnesium-chloride) or [magnesium sulphate](/e518-magnesium-sulphate)
- To adjust acidity or buffer pH: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- To supply gluconate without magnesium: [sodium gluconate](/e576-sodium-gluconate) or [potassium gluconate](/e577-potassium-gluconate)

Choice depends on taste, solubility, labeling goals, and dietary needs.

## How is Magnesium Gluconate made?
Magnesium gluconate is the magnesium salt of gluconic acid. Gluconic acid and its lactone form, [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), are typically produced by fermenting glucose with food-grade microorganisms; this is a long-established food process in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) of the United States.[^3] E580 is then obtained by neutralizing gluconic acid (or its lactone) with a permitted magnesium source, with identity and purity specifications laid out in EU law.[^1]

Closely related ingredients include [gluconic acid](/e574-gluconic-acid) itself and other gluconate salts such as [sodium gluconate](/e576-sodium-gluconate) and [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate).

## Is Magnesium Gluconate safe to eat?
When used as permitted in the EU under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, magnesium gluconate is considered safe in foods.[^2] As with many magnesium salts, very high intakes from supplements or medications can cause loose stools or diarrhea. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) sets a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 350 mg per day for magnesium taken as supplements or medications in adults; this UL does not apply to magnesium naturally present in foods and beverages.[^4]

## Does Magnesium Gluconate have any benefits?
Magnesium is an essential mineral that supports muscle and nerve function and helps maintain normal bone and heart rhythm. Using magnesium gluconate in fortified foods is one way to help meet daily magnesium needs, alongside a varied diet.[^5]

## Who should avoid Magnesium Gluconate?
- People with kidney disease should avoid high magnesium intakes unless advised by a clinician, because the body may not clear excess magnesium well.[^5]
- Anyone taking magnesium-containing laxatives or antacids should be cautious about extra magnesium from fortified foods or supplements.[^4]
- If you have been told to limit minerals for medical reasons, check with your healthcare provider before using products with added magnesium.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E-numbers are artificial chemicals.” Fact: E-numbers are simply approved additives in the EU; many, like magnesium gluconate, are mineral salts or fermentation products.
- Myth: “Magnesium gluconate is the same as metallic magnesium.” Fact: It is a magnesium salt; it supplies magnesium ions but is not metallic magnesium.
- Myth: “More magnesium is always better.” Fact: Excess supplemental magnesium can cause gastrointestinal upset, and very high doses can be risky for some people.

## Magnesium Gluconate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, it appears as “magnesium gluconate” or “E580.” You may find it in:
- Fortified waters and sports drinks
- Breakfast cereals and granola with added minerals
- Nutrition and protein bars
- Plant-based milks and dairy drinks
- Electrolyte and hydration powders
