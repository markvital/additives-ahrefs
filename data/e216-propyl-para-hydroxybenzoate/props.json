  "description": "Propylparaben, the n-propyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, occurs as a natural substance found in many plants and some insects, although it is manufactured synthetically for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and foods. It is a preservative typically found in many water-based cosmetics, such as creams, lotions, shampoos and bath products.  As a food additive, it has the E number E216. Sodium propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, the sodium salt of propylparaben, a compound with formula Na-C3H7-C6H4COO-O-, is also used similarly as a food additive and as an anti-fungal preservation agent. Its E number is E217. In 2010 the European Union Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety stated that it considered the use of  butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products as safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%.",
