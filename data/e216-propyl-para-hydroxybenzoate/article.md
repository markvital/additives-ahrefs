Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E216), also called propylparaben, is a preservative from the paraben family. It helps stop mold and yeast from growing, which can extend the shelf life of certain foods. Its approval varies by region, so availability in foods depends on local rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: A paraben preservative used to slow mold and yeast growth
- Also called: Propylparaben, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, E216
- Where it’s used: Allowed in some countries (for example, the U.S.); not permitted as a food additive in the EU
- How it works: Most effective in acidic foods and beverages
- Label check: Look for “propylparaben,” “propyl p-hydroxybenzoate,” or “E216”
- Safety snapshot: Recognized by the U.S. FDA for use under good manufacturing practice; removed from the EU list of permitted food additives in 2006

## Why is Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
Manufacturers use E216 to keep foods fresh longer by inhibiting spoilage microorganisms, especially molds and yeasts. This helps maintain quality and reduce waste, particularly in products with moisture and mildly acidic pH.

## What foods contain Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
Use depends on the country. In the United States, propylparaben may be used as an antimicrobial preservative in foods when applied according to good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, E216 is not authorized as a food additive, so it should not appear in EU foods.[^3]

Typical categories where it may appear in places where it’s allowed:
- Shelf-stable baked goods, dessert toppings, and fillings
- Syrups, flavored drinks, and drink concentrates
- Sauces, condiments, and pickled products

Always check the ingredient list, as labeling rules require its common name (for example, “propylparaben”) or, in some regions, the E-number.

## What can replace Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
Depending on the food and pH, formulators often consider:
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- [Sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid)
- [Calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate) for baked goods
- Natural antimicrobials like [nisin](/e234-nisin) or [natamycin](/e235-natamycin) in suitable foods
- Acidulants such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to lower pH and support preservative action

## How is Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate made?
Chemically, propylparaben is the propyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, part of the paraben family of esters. Industrial production typically prepares this class by combining p-hydroxybenzoic acid with an alcohol (here, 1-propanol) to form the ester.[^4]

## Is Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists propyl p-hydroxybenzoate as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food as an antimicrobial preservative when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1]
- European Union: The EU removed E216 (propylparaben) and its sodium salt E217 from the list of permitted food additives; they do not appear on the current Union list.[^3] Earlier scientific reviews by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted limited toxicological support for propylparaben compared with shorter-chain parabens, and recommended against its food use pending adequate data.[^2]

Different regions may therefore allow or prohibit E216 based on their risk assessments and policy choices.

## Does Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
Yes. Its main benefit is extending shelf life by slowing the growth of spoilage microbes, especially molds and yeasts. This helps keep foods tasting and smelling fresher for longer and can reduce food waste.

## Who should avoid Propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
- People with a diagnosed sensitivity or allergy to parabens should avoid products listing propylparaben.
- In the EU, consumers will rarely need to avoid it in foods because it is not authorized as a food additive.[^3]
- Scientific discussions have focused on propylparaben’s safety margins compared with other parabens; EFSA advised against its use in foods without more data, which led to its removal from the EU list.[^2] If you have specific health concerns, consult your healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All parabens are banned everywhere.” Fact: Regulations differ. For example, the FDA allows propylparaben in foods under good manufacturing practice, while the EU does not permit E216 in foods.[^1][^3]
- Myth: “If it’s on a label, it must be unsafe.” Fact: Food additives are regulated. Agencies review exposure, toxicology, and intended use before allowing or disallowing them.
- Myth: “E-numbers mean artificial chemicals.” Fact: E-numbers are simply EU codes for additives, including some that are natural or nature-identical.

## E216 in branded foods
What you’ll see on a package depends on the market:
- In countries where E216 is allowed in foods, look for “propylparaben,” “propyl p-hydroxybenzoate,” or sometimes “E216.”
- In the EU, E216 should not appear on food labels because it is not an authorized additive for foods.[^3]

Because rules and recipes change, the most reliable way to know is to read the current ingredient list.
