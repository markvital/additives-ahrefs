Alpha-Amylase (E1100) is an enzyme that breaks starch into sugars. It helps bread rise and brown evenly, and it improves brewing and starch processing. Look for “enzymes” or “amylase” on bread and flour labels.

- Also called/E-number: Alpha-Amylase; E1100; amylase; E-1100; E 1100
- What it does: Breaks starch into shorter sugars; improves dough handling, rise, crumb softness, and browning; aids mashing/saccharification in brewing; liquefies starch in sweetener production
- Common in: Sliced bread, rolls, tortillas, pizza dough, flour improvers, baking mixes; used in brewing and starch syrups
- Diet flags: Usually vegan/vegetarian when made by microbial fermentation; may be standardized on wheat-based carriers—check for “wheat” allergen; gluten-free if no wheat carrier is used; kosher/halal versions exist

1) Why it’s added to food
- It speeds starch breakdown so yeast gets more fermentable sugars. This helps bread rise, improves texture, and keeps softness longer.
- In brewing, it helps convert grain starches into sugars for fermentation. In starch processing, it helps liquefy thick starch slurries.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Commercial breads, buns, tortillas, pita, and pizza dough often list “enzymes” or “amylase.” Flour and baking mixes may include it as a dough improver.
- It is used in beer mashing and in making corn/wheat starch syrups, though it may not appear on consumer labels if used as a processing aid.
- Shopping tips:
  - Check ingredient lists for “enzymes,” “amylase,” or “fungal amylase.”
  - If you avoid wheat, look for allergen statements; some enzyme preparations use wheat-based carriers.
  - For gluten-free needs, pick products labeled “Gluten-Free” and avoid “malted barley flour.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Diastatic malt (malted barley flour) provides natural amylase for home baking. Look for “diastatic malt powder” if you want a pantry alternative.
- Longer dough fermentation or preferments (like poolish or sourdough) can enhance rise and flavor without added enzymes.
- Other enzymes (for industry) include glucoamylase for deeper starch breakdown, but that is not common for home baking.

4) How Alpha-Amylase is manufactured
- Most food alpha-amylase comes from safe, non-pathogenic microbes (such as Aspergillus oryzae or Bacillus species) grown by controlled fermentation. The enzyme is filtered, purified, and standardized for consistent activity.
- Some products use grain-based sources (malted barley) that naturally contain alpha-amylase. Animal-sourced (pancreatic) amylase is typically used in supplements or medical products, not routine baking.
- Enzyme preparations may be blended with carriers or stabilizers. Check labels for any allergens (for example, wheat).

5) How safe is Alpha-Amylase for consumption?
- Food enzymes like alpha-amylase have been reviewed by major authorities and are considered safe when used as intended. In the U.S., many enzyme preparations are affirmed as GRAS and used as processing aids with minimal carryover.
- Occupational exposure (inhaling enzyme dust) can cause allergy in bakery workers, but dietary exposure is low and oral allergy is rare.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Alpha-amylase is part of some digestive enzyme supplements and medical pancreatic enzyme products. These are intended to help digest starch when the body lacks enzymes.
- For generally healthy people, added amylase is not shown to improve health. Do not use it to treat any condition without medical guidance.

7) When Alpha-Amylase may be unsafe (contraindications)
- If you have a known enzyme or fungal allergen sensitivity, avoid products listing “amylase” and choose items without added “enzymes.”
- If you have wheat allergy or celiac disease, verify products are gluten-free. Some enzyme preparations are standardized on wheat-based carriers; look for “Contains wheat” allergen statements.
- For supplements: many pancreatic enzyme products are animal-derived (porcine). Avoid if you keep vegetarian/vegan, kosher, or halal diets unless the product is certified.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Alpha-amylase is a preservative.” Fact: It is a processing enzyme that breaks starch into sugars; it does not preserve food. Source: FDA (fda.gov) — definition of processing aids; URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “Alpha-amylase adds gluten to bread.” Fact: The enzyme itself contains no gluten; any gluten comes from flour ingredients, not the enzyme. Source: FDA (fda.gov) — Gluten-Free rule overview; URL to be added by editor
- Myth: “All alpha-amylase comes from animals.” Fact: Most food alpha-amylase is produced by microbial fermentation (Aspergillus, Bacillus) or from malted grains. Source: EFSA (efsa.europa.eu) — Food enzyme dossiers; URL to be added by editor

Alpha-Amylase in Branded Foods
- You will most often see it in sliced bread, hamburger/hot dog buns, tortillas, and flour conditioners. Some breakfast cereals and bakery mixes also list “enzymes” that may include amylase.
- It may appear as “enzymes” rather than “alpha-amylase” on ingredient lists. Choose products with transparent labeling if you prefer specifics.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) What is E1100 (alpha-amylase)?
- It is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars. It is used to improve baking and brewing.

2) Is alpha-amylase vegan?
- Usually yes when made by microbes. If you avoid animal products, look for “vegan” claims or contact the brand.
