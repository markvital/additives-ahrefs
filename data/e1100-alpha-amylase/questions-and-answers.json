      "q": "what does amylase break down",
      "a": "It breaks down starch (amylose and amylopectin) by cleaving alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds into shorter sugars such as maltose, maltotriose, and dextrins.",

    {
      "q": "what does amylase do",
      "a": "Alpha-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into shorter, fermentable sugars; in foods it reduces starch viscosity and helps baking and brewing by generating sugars for yeast.",

    {
      "q": "where is amylase produced",
      "a": "In humans it’s produced by the salivary glands and the pancreas; industrially (E1100) it’s made mainly by microbial fermentation (e.g., Bacillus or Aspergillus), and plants also produce it.",

    {
      "q": "where is amylase found",
      "a": "It occurs in saliva and pancreatic secretions, in many plants and microorganisms, and in foods as a processing aid in baked goods, brewing, and starch syrups.",

    {
      "q": "is amylase an enzyme",
      "a": "Yes—alpha-amylase (E1100) is an enzyme (a glycoside hydrolase) that breaks down starch.",
