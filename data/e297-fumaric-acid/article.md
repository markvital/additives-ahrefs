Fumaric acid (E297) is a tart-tasting food acid used to sharpen flavor and control acidity. It works well in dry mixes and baked goods because it is stable and does not absorb moisture easily.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of what E297 does in foods.
- What it is: an organic acid (also called trans-butenedioic acid) used as an acidity regulator and flavor booster.
- What it does: adds a clean, strong sour taste and lowers pH to help recipes set, gel, or keep better.
- Where you find it: tortillas and flatbreads, powdered drink mixes, flavored waters, gelatin desserts, confections, and snack seasonings.
- Why makers like it: very concentrated sourness, good shelf stability, and slow reaction in baking systems.
- Dietary notes: typically vegan, gluten-free, and not derived from major allergens.
- Label names: “fumaric acid” or “E297.”

## Why is Fumaric acid added to food?
Food makers use fumaric acid to give a bright, tart taste and to control acidity (pH), which can help with flavor, texture, and shelf life. In the United States, it is affirmed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as a flavoring agent and adjuvant when used in line with good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^1]

## What foods contain Fumaric acid?
You’ll most often see E297 in:
- Tortillas and flatbreads
- Powdered drink mixes and flavored waters
- Gelatin desserts and gummy candies
- Fruit fillings, jams, and pie fillings
- Dry seasoning blends and coated snacks
- Some baked goods as part of a leavening system with bases like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)

On ingredient lists, it will appear as “fumaric acid” or “E297.”

## What can replace Fumaric acid?
If a recipe or product needs a different acid profile, makers may swap in:
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for a quick, citrus-like sour
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for a smooth, lingering tartness
- [Lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) for gentle acidity in dairy-style foods
- [Tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) for grape-like tartness, common in wine and baking
- [Adipic acid](/e355-adipic-acid) for certain gels and confections
- [Succinic acid](/e363-succinic-acid) for savory notes and buffering

The best substitute depends on taste, pH target, and how quickly the acid should react in the formula.

## How is Fumaric acid made?
Food‑grade fumaric acid is produced in two main ways:
- From maleic acid or maleic anhydride by catalytic isomerization (a controlled chemical rearrangement).
- By fermentation of carbohydrates (such as sugars) using specific food-grade microorganisms.[^2]

In the European Union (EU), specifications define identity and purity for E297, including approved manufacturing methods and impurity limits for food use.[^2]

## Is Fumaric acid safe to eat?
Safety evaluations by major regulators support its use at approved levels. In the U.S., fumaric acid is affirmed as GRAS and may be used in foods according to GMP, which means only the amount needed to achieve the intended effect should be added.[^1] In the EU, E297 has defined food‑grade specifications that set limits on impurities, helping ensure consistent quality and safety.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated fumaric acid and its salts and found no safety concerns at the reported uses and use levels.[^3]

GRAS means “Generally Recognized as Safe” based on scientific evidence and expert agreement. GMP means using the minimum effective amount needed for the function in the food.

## Does Fumaric acid have any benefits?
For food makers, fumaric acid offers practical benefits:
- Strong, clean sourness, so only small amounts are needed.
- Good performance in dry mixes and seasonings because it is not very hygroscopic (doesn’t pull in water).
- Useful in baking as a slow‑reacting acid that can pair with bases like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) for controlled leavening.

These are technical benefits to product quality rather than health benefits.

## Who should avoid Fumaric acid?
Most people can enjoy foods with E297 as part of a normal diet. Those who are sensitive to sour, acidic foods (for example, people with frequent heartburn or acid‑sensitive teeth) may prefer to limit highly tart products. If you have specific dietary or medical concerns, check labels and consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are unsafe.” Fact: E-numbers are simply codes for approved additives in the EU; each has been evaluated for safety.
- Myth: “Fumaric acid only comes from petroleum.” Fact: Food‑grade fumaric acid can also be made by fermentation of sugars.
- Myth: “Fumaric acid is the same as malic acid.” Fact: They are different acids with different taste profiles and behaviors in recipes.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: Fumaric acid is mainly an acidity regulator; lowering pH can help stability, but it is not a traditional preservative like benzoates or sorbates.

## Fumaric acid in branded foods
You can find E297 in many mainstream products. Look for it on the ingredient list of tortillas and wraps, powdered drink mixes, flavored waters, gelatin desserts, gummies, fruit fillings, and some baked snacks. Availability and use vary by brand and country, so checking the label is the surest way to know if a product contains fumaric acid.
