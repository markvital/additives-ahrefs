      "q": "how much glycine per day",
      "a": "There’s no numerical ADI set for E640(i); in the EU it’s permitted at quantum satis (levels needed for the intended effect), and exposure from its use as an additive is small compared with the several grams of glycine naturally consumed daily from protein foods.",

    {
      "q": "what does glycine do",
      "a": "In foods it acts mainly as a flavor enhancer and taste modifier (mildly sweet, masks bitterness) and as a buffering agent to help control pH.",

      "q": "what is glycine used for",
      "a": "It’s used to enhance flavor, add mild sweetness, mask off-notes, and buffer pH in various processed foods and beverages.",

    {
      "q": "is glycine polar or nonpolar",
      "a": "Glycine is often classified as nonpolar, but as a small zwitterionic amino acid it’s highly water‑soluble and behaves neutrally in aqueous foods.",

    {
      "q": "what is glycine good for",
      "a": "As a food additive it’s good for improving taste (sweetness/umami balance, bitterness masking) and stabilizing acidity; it’s not intended for therapeutic effects.",
