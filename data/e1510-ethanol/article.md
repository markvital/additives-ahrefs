Ethanol (E1510) is a food-grade alcohol used mainly as a solvent and carrier for flavors, colors, and extracts. It also appears naturally in fermented foods and beverages and can act as a mild preservative.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: E1510; ethyl alcohol; ethanol; Methylcarbinol; Ethyl hydroxide; Ethyl hydrate
- What it does: Solvent and carrier for flavors and colors; extracts plant compounds; helps preserve
- Common in: Vanilla and other extracts, flavors, confectionery glazes, alcoholic drinks, bitters, some sauces
- Diet flags: Vegan and vegetarian; gluten-free when distilled; contains alcohol

1) Why it’s added to food
- It dissolves and carries flavor and color compounds that do not mix well with water.  
- It helps make stable vanilla and other botanical extracts. It may also provide mild antimicrobial effects in high enough amounts.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Vanilla, almond, and citrus extracts; flavor concentrates; bitters.  
- Alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits) and liqueur-filled chocolates.  
- Confectionery glazes (e.g., shellac solutions), some sauces, and spray flavors.  
Shopping tips:
- Check labels for ethyl alcohol, ethanol, or “alcohol” in extracts and flavors.  
- Choose “alcohol-free” or “glycerin-based” extracts if you avoid alcohol.  
- For gluten concerns, distilled products are typically gluten-free unless gluten is added after distillation.

3) What are its alternatives
- Glycerin (glycerol) for alcohol-free extracts and flavors.  
- Propylene glycol (E1520) as a common solvent and carrier in flavors.  
- Oil-based carriers (e.g., vegetable oil) for fat-soluble flavors.  
- Supercritical CO2 extraction for some botanicals (often used upstream, not listed as an ingredient).  
Shopping tips:
- Look for “alcohol-free” on extract labels if you want to avoid ethanol.  
- If sensitive to propylene glycol, choose glycerin-based or oil-based options.

4) How Ethanol is manufactured
- Most food-grade ethanol is made by fermenting sugars or starches (e.g., sugarcane, corn, fruits) with yeast, then distilling to high purity.  
- It can also be made synthetically (hydration of ethylene), but food and beverage uses typically specify fermentation origin.  
- Denatured alcohol (ethanol with added bittering or other agents) is not for food use.

5) How safe is Ethanol for consumption?
- In foods, ethanol is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used as intended, mainly as a solvent/carrier in small amounts. For alcoholic beverages, standard alcohol safety and legal drinking-age rules apply.  
- Cooking reduces but may not eliminate alcohol; the amount left depends on time, heat, and method.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Ethanol is used medically as an antiseptic on skin and, under clinical supervision, as an antidote for certain poisonings.  
- These are medical uses, not nutrition benefits, and should not guide personal intake.

7) When Ethanol may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Avoid if you are pregnant or may become pregnant; no safe level of alcohol in pregnancy is known (CDC guidance).  
- Avoid if you have alcohol use disorder, liver disease, or must avoid alcohol for medical or personal reasons.  
- Talk to your clinician or pharmacist if you take medicines that interact with alcohol (e.g., disulfiram; some antibiotics like metronidazole).

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Cooking removes all alcohol.” Fact: Cooking can reduce alcohol but may leave some behind depending on method and time. Source: USDA (Agricultural Research Service) — alcohol retention data (URL to be added by editor).  
- Myth: “All ethanol in foods contains gluten.” Fact: Distilled alcohol is considered gluten-free unless gluten is added after distillation. Source: TTB (U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) gluten labeling guidance (URL to be added by editor).  
- Myth: “Food-grade ethanol is the same as denatured alcohol.” Fact: Denatured alcohol contains added agents and is not for consumption. Source: TTB denatured alcohol regulations (URL to be added by editor).

Ethanol in Branded Foods
- You’ll see ethanol in vanilla and other extracts, flavors, bitters, confectionery glazes, and liqueur-filled chocolates. Some sauces and sprays use ethanol as a carrier.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is E1510 (ethanol) the same as drinking alcohol?  
Yes. It is the same chemical. In foods it’s usually a small amount used as a solvent or in extracts, while beverages contain higher levels.

- Does ethanol show up on ingredient labels?  
Sometimes. Look for ethyl alcohol, ethanol, alcohol, or named extracts (like “vanilla extract,” which by standard contains alcohol).

- Can I cook off the alcohol from vanilla extract?  
Heat lowers alcohol, but some can remain. Longer cooking and higher heat remove more, but not always 100%.

- Is ethanol vegan and gluten-free?  
Yes, ethanol itself is vegan and, when distilled, gluten-free. Check for any post-distillation additives if you are highly sensitive.

- What should I choose if I avoid alcohol?  
Pick “alcohol-free” or “glycerin-based” extracts and flavors. Avoid liqueur-filled candies and check sauces and sprays for alcohol.
