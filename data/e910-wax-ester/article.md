Wax ester (E910) is a broad term for long‑chain wax compounds that can form a thin, shiny coating on foods. It has been used as a glazing agent, but it is rarely listed on modern ingredient labels because other, better‑defined waxes are preferred and more widely authorized.

## At a glance
- What it is: a class of long‑chain esters made from fatty acids and fatty alcohols
- Main role: glazing agent to add shine and reduce moisture loss
- Where you might see it: fruit coatings, confectionery, and chewing gum (though other waxes are much more common today)
- Common alternatives: beeswax (E901), candelilla wax (E902), carnauba wax (E903), shellac (E904), microcrystalline wax (E905), rice bran wax (E908), montanic acid esters (E912), lanolin (E913)
- Diet notes: source can be plant, mineral, or animal; check the label if you avoid animal‑derived ingredients
- Label names: “E910” or “wax ester”

## Why is Wax ester added to food?
Wax esters form a very thin, even film on the surface of foods. This film gives a glossy look, helps fruits and sweets keep moisture, and reduces sticking in products like chewing gum. In short, it is used to protect the surface and improve appearance.

## What foods contain Wax ester?
If used, wax ester would most likely appear on the surface of fresh produce, confectionery, or chewing gum. However, in the European Union (EU), the current Union list of authorized glazing agents specifies individual waxes (such as E901–E905, E912, and E913), and does not include a generic “wax ester” entry under E910.[^1] That is why you will more often see specific wax names on labels instead of E910.

## What can replace Wax ester?
Food makers usually choose well‑defined, approved waxes instead of a generic “wax ester,” including:
- [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) (E901)
- [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) (E902)
- [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) (E903)
- [shellac](/e904-shellac) (E904)
- [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax) (E905)
- [rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax) (E908)
- [montanic acid esters](/e912-montanic-acid-esters) (E912)
- [lanolin](/e913-lanolin) (E913)

These choices are common because they have clear purity criteria and established safety evaluations.

## How is Wax ester made?
Wax esters are made by reacting long‑chain fatty acids with long‑chain fatty alcohols (an “esterification” reaction). The building blocks can come from vegetable oils, mineral sources, or animal waxes. The result is a hard, water‑resistant material that melts at warm temperatures and spreads into a thin film.

## Is Wax ester safe to eat?
Safety depends on the exact wax and its purity. Regulatory bodies approve specific wax additives with detailed specifications rather than a broad, undefined “wax ester.” In the EU, the specification regulation lists particular waxes (for example, E901–E905, E912, E913) and does not include E910 as a generic category.[^1] In practice, coatings on fresh fruits and vegetables that use approved food‑grade waxes are considered safe when used as intended, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is the U.S. agency that oversees food safety.[^2] EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has also re‑evaluated individual waxes such as beeswax (E901) under modern safety standards.[^4]  

## Does Wax ester have any benefits?
Yes. A thin wax film can:
- slow moisture loss from fruits and vegetables, helping them stay fresh longer[^2]
- reduce surface sticking in confectionery and chewing gum
- add a uniform shine that consumers expect on some products

These benefits are why producers typically use well‑characterized waxes with clear specifications.

## Who should avoid Wax ester?
- Strict vegetarians, vegans, or those avoiding insect‑ or animal‑derived ingredients should check the source. Some waxes are plant‑based (like carnauba or candelilla), while others can be animal‑derived (such as [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) or [shellac](/e904-shellac)).  
- People sensitive to wool wax (lanolin) may wish to avoid coatings derived from [lanolin](/e913-lanolin).  
- If you have dietary restrictions or a medical condition, ask a healthcare professional for personal advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: All fruit waxes are petroleum products.  
  Fact: Many approved waxes are plant‑based (carnauba, candelilla) or insect/animal‑derived (shellac, beeswax), and some are mineral‑based; it depends on the specific additive.

- Myth: Wax coatings “seal in” pesticides.  
  Fact: Waxes reduce moisture loss and add shine; they are not intended to “trap” residues. Washing and peeling practices still matter.

- Myth: E910 is common on labels.  
  Fact: You are more likely to see specific wax names such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), or [shellac](/e904-shellac).

## Wax ester in branded foods
E910 is uncommon on ingredient lists today. If present, it would typically appear as “E910” or “wax ester,” usually in the context of a surface coating. Most brands list specific waxes instead, such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax).
