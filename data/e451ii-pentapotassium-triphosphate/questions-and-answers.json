      "q": "what is the refractive index of ktpp",
      "a": "There isn’t a single published refractive index for solid pentapotassium triphosphate; food-grade specs don’t list it. For aqueous solutions, refractive index depends on concentration and temperature, so you’d need to measure nD under your specific conditions.",

      "q": "what is the refractive index of potassium triphosphate",
      "a": "A fixed refractive index isn’t typically reported for the solid; it’s not a standard QC parameter for this additive. In solution, the refractive index increases with concentration and varies with temperature and wavelength, so measure it for your formulation.",

      "q": "what is the refractive index of potassium tripolyphosphate",
      "a": "No standard single value is published for the solid; specifications for E451ii don’t include refractive index. For practical purposes, determine nD on your specific potassium tripolyphosphate solution at the required concentration and temperature.",
