Candelilla wax (E902) is a plant-based wax used to give foods a smooth, glossy finish and a light moisture barrier. It comes from the candelilla shrub and appears in coatings for sweets and other foods where shine and nonstick qualities matter.

## At a glance
- Plant-derived wax from the candelilla shrub; labeled as E902 in the EU.
- Used mainly as a glazing or coating agent to add shine and reduce sticking.
- Common in confectionery and chewing gum; vegan-friendly alternative to animal-derived coatings.

## Why is Candelilla wax added to food?
Manufacturers use candelilla wax to create a thin, edible coating that adds gloss, prevents sticking, and helps protect delicate surfaces. In the EU, E902 is authorised as a glazing agent, a functional class used to coat foods for appearance and handling.^[ ^2 ] It can also adjust texture in products like chewing gum by helping bind and structure the base.

## What foods contain Candelilla wax?
You’ll most often see candelilla wax on the surface of:
- Confectionery such as hard candies, dragées, and jelly beans
- Chewing gum (as part of the gum base in the U.S.)^[ ^3 ]
- Chocolate-coated nuts and similar snack coatings
- Occasionally, fresh produce coatings and decorative bakery items

On labels, look for “candelilla wax” or “E902.”

## What can replace Candelilla wax?
Alternatives depend on the product and dietary needs:
- Other waxes: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) (plant-based), [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) (animal-derived), [shellac](/e904-shellac) (insect-derived), or [rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax).
- Non-wax glazes in some cases, such as [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum), though they offer different shine and barrier properties.

## How is Candelilla wax made?
Candelilla wax is obtained from the leaves and stems of the candelilla shrub (a Euphorbia species). The crude wax is extracted from the plant material with hot water and then refined to remove impurities, yielding a hard, brittle, pale-yellow to brown wax composed mainly of long-chain hydrocarbons and esters.^[ ^1 ] The refined material is standardized to meet composition and purity specifications set by regulators.^[ ^1 ]

## Is Candelilla wax safe to eat?
Candelilla wax is authorised for use in the European Union, with detailed identity and purity specifications published in EU law.^[ ^1 ] Regulatory approvals indicate it may be used in defined food categories and at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice, including as a glazing agent in the EU^[ ^2 ] and as a component of chewing gum base in the U.S.^[ ^3 ] When used as permitted, it is considered acceptable for consumption by these authorities.

## Does Candelilla wax have any benefits?
- Product quality: Adds a glossy finish and a protective, low-moisture barrier that helps reduce sticking and scuffing.
- Handling: Makes candies and coated snacks flow better on production lines and in packaging.
- Dietary preference: Plant-based, so it’s a common vegan alternative to beeswax or shellac coatings.

## Who should avoid Candelilla wax?
Most people don’t need to avoid candelilla wax. However:
- If you are following guidance to avoid edible coatings (for medical or personal reasons), check labels for “candelilla wax” or “E902.”
- If you avoid animal-derived products, note that candelilla wax is plant-based, unlike [shellac](/e904-shellac) and [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax).

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Candelilla wax is plastic.” Fact: It’s a natural plant wax composed mainly of long-chain hydrocarbons and esters.^[ ^1 ]
- Myth: “All food glazes are animal-derived.” Fact: Candelilla and [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) are plant-based.
- Myth: “It’s only for candy.” Fact: It’s also used in chewing gum and some coated snacks, and permitted as gum base in the U.S.^[ ^3 ]

## Candelilla wax in branded foods
You’re most likely to find E902 on ingredient lists for hard-coated candies, chocolate dragées, and chewing gum. Label wording varies by market; in the EU it may appear as “E902,” while in many other regions it’s listed as “candelilla wax.” If you prefer plant-based coatings, E902 and [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) fit that bill, while [shellac](/e904-shellac) and [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) do not.
