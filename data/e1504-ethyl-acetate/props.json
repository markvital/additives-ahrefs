  "description": "Ethyl acetate -systematically ethyl ethanoate, commonly abbreviated EtOAc or EA- is the organic compound with the formula CH3–COO–CH2–CH3, simplified to C4H8O2. This colorless liquid has a characteristic sweet smell -similar to pear drops- and is used in glues, nail polish removers, decaffeinating tea and coffee. Ethyl acetate is the ester of ethanol and acetic acid; it is manufactured on a large scale for use as a solvent.  The combined annual production in 1985 of Japan, North America, and Europe was about 400‚000 tonnes. In 2004, an estimated 1.3 million tonnes were produced worldwide.",
