Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E217) is a preservative from the paraben family. It helps stop molds and yeasts from growing, which keeps foods fresher for longer. Rules for its use can differ by country, and labels may list it as “E217,” “sodium propyl paraben,” or “sodium propyl p-hydroxybenzoate.”

## At a glance
- What it is: The sodium salt of propyl paraben, a member of the paraben preservative group.
- What it does: Inhibits growth of molds and yeasts to extend shelf life.
- Where it appears: Historically used in foods like syrups, desserts, and beverages; always check the ingredient list.
- How it’s labeled: “E217,” “sodium propyl paraben,” or “sodium propyl p-hydroxybenzoate.”
- Safety: Evaluated by major regulators; allowable uses and limits vary by region. See local rules and product labels.

## Why is Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
Parabens are effective against yeasts and molds, two common causes of spoilage. E217 is used because it helps protect foods with moisture and sugar—conditions where fungal growth can take off—thereby supporting food safety and shelf life at low use levels.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
You may find parabens in products that benefit from broad-spectrum antifungal protection, such as flavored syrups, toppings, desserts, or some beverages. Availability and permitted uses vary by market and over time, so the surest way to know is to read the ingredient list for “sodium propyl paraben,” “E217,” or similar wording.[^2]

## What can replace Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
Depending on the food, manufacturers might switch to other preservatives or to processing and packaging changes. Common preservative alternatives include:
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- [Sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid)
- [Calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate) for some baked products
- [Nisin](/e234-nisin) or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary) in certain applications

Adjusting pH (for example with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)), reducing water activity, pasteurization, and aseptic packaging are also common strategies used alongside or instead of preservatives.

## How is Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate made?
E217 is the sodium salt of propyl paraben (propyl p‑hydroxybenzoate). In practice, manufacturers make the ester (propyl paraben) and then neutralize it with sodium hydroxide to form the more water‑soluble sodium salt.[^3] This salt form helps it dissolve and mix evenly in many foods.

## Is Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
Parabens used in food have been evaluated by food safety bodies. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assessed p‑hydroxybenzoates (E214–E219) as food additives and established a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI, the amount considered safe to consume daily over a lifetime) of 0–10 mg per kg of body weight for parabens considered at the time.[^1] In the United States, the FDA’s Food Additive Status List summarizes approved uses for parabens in certain foods; exact permissions and limits depend on the specific substance and application.[^2] Always follow local regulations and product labeling.

## Does Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
The main benefit is shelf‑life extension. By limiting yeast and mold growth, E217 can help reduce food waste, maintain product quality, and keep flavors and textures stable during storage.[^1]

## Who should avoid Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate?
- Anyone advised by their healthcare provider to avoid parabens.
- People who know they are sensitive to parabens should check labels and choose products accordingly.
If you have questions about tolerance or diet, speak with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E217 is the same as propyl paraben.” Fact: E217 is the sodium salt of propyl paraben, which mainly improves water solubility.[^3]
- Myth: “All parabens behave the same.” Fact: Parabens differ by alkyl chain length; this can change their antimicrobial strength and solubility, so use depends on the food and formulation.[^1]
- Myth: “Regulatory rules are identical worldwide.” Fact: Permissions and limits for parabens can vary by country and product type; always check local regulations and the label.[^2][^4]

## Sodium propyl para-hydroxybenzoate in branded foods
How to spot it on a label:
- In the EU and other regions using E‑numbers: listed as “E217.”
- Elsewhere: look for “sodium propyl paraben” or “sodium propyl p‑hydroxybenzoate.”
Labels change and approvals vary by country, so always confirm on the package.[^2]
