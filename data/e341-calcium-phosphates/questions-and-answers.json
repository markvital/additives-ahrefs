      "q": "how does calcium phosphate transfection work",
      "a": "DNA is mixed with calcium chloride and then added to a phosphate buffer to form fine calcium phosphate–DNA precipitates that attach to cells and are taken up (endocytosis), delivering the genetic material. This is a lab technique and not a food use of E341.",

      "q": "what is mono calcium phosphate",
      "a": "Monocalcium phosphate [Ca(H2PO4)2], designated E341(i), is an acidic calcium phosphate used as a leavening acid and acidity regulator in baking, and it is relatively water‑soluble.",

      "q": "what is dibasic calcium phosphate",
      "a": "Dibasic (dicalcium) phosphate [CaHPO4], E341(ii), is a sparingly water‑soluble calcium phosphate used as an anti‑caking agent, buffering agent, and mineral fortificant.",

    {
      "q": "is calcium phosphate soluble in water",
      "a": "It depends on the form: monocalcium phosphate is fairly soluble, dicalcium phosphate is sparingly soluble, and tricalcium phosphate is practically insoluble.",

      "q": "what is di calcium phosphate",
      "a": "Dicalcium phosphate (dibasic calcium phosphate, CaHPO4), E341(ii), is a low‑solubility form used in foods as an anti‑caking agent and as a calcium/phosphate fortificant.",
