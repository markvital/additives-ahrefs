Succinic acid (E363) is a tart-tasting organic acid used to adjust acidity and fine-tune flavor in foods and drinks. It occurs naturally in small amounts in fermented foods and is approved in both the EU and U.S. for specific food uses under good manufacturing practice.<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: an organic acid (butanedioic acid) used as an acidity regulator and flavoring.
- Taste: mildly sour; related salts can add savory depth.
- Where it’s used: beverages, candies, sauces, and other processed foods.
- Status: authorized in the EU (E363) and permitted in the U.S. as a synthetic flavoring substance, when used as intended.
- Label names: “succinic acid” or “E363.”

## Why is Succinic acid added to food?
Food makers add succinic acid to set or stabilize a product’s pH (acidity), which helps control taste and performance of other ingredients. It is also permitted as a flavoring substance, used at very low levels to round out flavor profiles.[^1][^3]

In the EU, succinic acid is a listed food additive (E363) with purity specifications set by law; its principal technological purpose is acidity regulation (pH control) and flavoring.[^2][^1]

## What foods contain Succinic acid?
You may find succinic acid in:
- Flavored drinks and drink mixes
- Confectionery (for tartness)
- Savory sauces, seasonings, and certain processed foods

It also occurs naturally in fermented foods and beverages (for example, some cheeses, beers, and wines), typically at low levels that contribute to taste without being individually noticeable.[^1]

Approved uses and levels in the EU depend on the food category and follow the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and associated specifications.[^2]

## What can replace Succinic acid?
Depending on the recipe and the target taste or pH, common substitutes include:
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for bright, clean sourness
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for a smoother, lingering tartness
- [Fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid) for strong acidity in dry mixes
- [Lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) for gentle acidity in dairy and fermented-style products
- [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid) for certain confectionery and beverage applications

The best choice depends on solubility, desired sourness curve, and how the acid interacts with other ingredients.

## How is Succinic acid made?
Modern food-grade succinic acid is produced by:
- Chemical routes, such as hydrogenation of maleic or fumaric acid, followed by purification, or
- Microbial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugars) using selected food-grade microorganisms, then isolation and refining to meet purity specifications.[^1][^2]

Regulatory specifications set minimum purity, limits for contaminants, and identification tests to ensure consistent quality of the additive.[^2]

## Is Succinic acid safe to eat?
In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated succinic acid (E363) and concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels as a food additive.[^1] Succinic acid has compositional and purity criteria established in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

In the U.S., succinic acid is permitted as a synthetic flavoring substance and adjuvant under federal regulations, when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3] As with all acids, it is used at low levels appropriate for taste and function.

## Does Succinic acid have any benefits?
- Functional: It helps set acidity and can enhance overall flavor balance in foods and beverages.
- Culinary: Its related salts can contribute a savory, brothy impression in some formulations.
- Biological context: Succinic acid (succinate) is a normal intermediate in human metabolism; the body handles small dietary amounts readily.[^5]

These are technological or sensory benefits rather than special nutritional advantages.

## Who should avoid Succinic acid?
Most people do not need to avoid E363. If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit acidic foods (for example, due to reflux or mouth irritation), check labels for “succinic acid” or “E363” and choose products accordingly.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Succinic acid comes from fossilized amber.”  
  Fact: Historic sources inspired the name, but today’s food-grade succinic acid is produced by controlled chemical synthesis or by fermentation and is highly purified.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “All synthetic acids are unsafe.”  
  Fact: Safety depends on the substance and its use level. EFSA found no safety concern for E363 at reported uses and levels, and the U.S. permits it as a flavoring substance under GMP.[^1][^3]
- Myth: “Natural and synthetic succinic acid are different in the body.”  
  Fact: The molecule is the same regardless of source; specifications ensure identity and purity.[^2]

## Succinic acid in branded foods
On labels, look for “succinic acid” or “E363.” You’re most likely to see it in flavored drinks, candies, and savory seasonings. Many brands use alternatives like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), so presence varies by product style and target flavor.
