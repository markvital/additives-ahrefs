      "a": "Metoprolol succinate is a heart medication; the “succinate” just means the drug is in a succinic acid salt form and isn’t the food additive use of E363. E363 (succinic acid) is used in foods as an acidity regulator and flavor enhancer, not to treat medical conditions.",

      "a": "Es un antihistamínico que a menudo se usa como somnífero; “succinate” indica la sal de ácido succínico y no corresponde al uso alimentario del E363. En alimentos, el E363 (ácido succínico) funciona como regulador de acidez y potenciador del sabor.",
