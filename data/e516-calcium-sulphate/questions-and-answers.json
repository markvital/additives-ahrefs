      "q": "what is gypsum used for",
      "a": "In foods (as E516), calcium sulfate is used as a firming and anticaking agent, stabilizer, dough conditioner, and as a coagulant in tofu and for adjusting brewing water. Outside food, gypsum is widely used to make plaster and drywall.",

      "q": "what is gypsum board",
      "a": "Gypsum board (drywall) is a construction panel with a calcium sulfate dihydrate core faced with paper; it’s not a food use, though it’s the same chemical as food‑grade E516.",

      "q": "what does gypsum do for soil",

      "q": "what is selenite good for",
      "a": "Selenite is a crystalline form of calcium sulfate used mainly as a decorative or collector mineral; it’s not used as a food additive. Food applications use purified, food‑grade calcium sulfate (E516) for firming and anticaking.",

    {
      "q": "how to cleanse selenite",
      "a": "Because selenite (gypsum) is soft and slightly water‑soluble, clean it by gently dusting or a brief wipe with a barely damp cloth, then dry immediately—avoid soaking or harsh cleaners. Keep it away from food surfaces, as only food‑grade calcium sulfate (E516) is intended for contact with foods.",
