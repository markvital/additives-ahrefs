Dimagnesium diphosphate (E450VIII) is a phosphate-based food additive used mainly as a leavening acid, acidity regulator, and emulsifying salt. It helps baked goods rise evenly and gives processed cheese a smooth, sliceable texture. It contains magnesium instead of sodium, which can be useful in low‑sodium recipes.

## At a glance
- Names on labels: E450VIII, dimagnesium diphosphate; part of the “diphosphates” group (E450)
- What it does: leavening acid for baking powders; acidity regulator; stabilizer; emulsifying salt in processed cheese
- Where it’s found: baking powders and self‑raising flours, cakes and biscuits, processed cheese and cheese spreads, some battered or breaded frozen foods
- Dietary notes: vegan and vegetarian friendly; not made from animal sources
- Sodium-free: uses magnesium rather than sodium

## Why is Dimagnesium diphosphate added to food?
Manufacturers use dimagnesium diphosphate to control batter and dough rise, regulate acidity (pH), bind metal ions (sequestrant), and stabilize emulsions in processed cheese. These functions are authorized in the European Union for the diphosphates group (E450) and are covered by modern safety evaluations of phosphate additives.[^2][^3]

## What foods contain Dimagnesium diphosphate?
You’ll most often see it in bakery mixes (baking powder, self‑raising flour), biscuits and cakes, and in processed cheese or cheese spreads where emulsifying salts are needed. It can also appear in some ready‑to‑eat or frozen coated foods where a controlled rise or firm texture is desired, consistent with the permitted uses for phosphates in the EU food additive rules.[^3]

## What can replace Dimagnesium diphosphate?
Depending on the recipe or process, common substitutes include:
- Other diphosphates such as [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate) (often called SAPP)
- Acidulants for leavening systems like [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Leavening partners such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)
- Emulsifying salts in processed cheese, for example [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate) or broader [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates)
- Slow‑acting acidifiers like [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone)

The best replacement depends on the target rise speed, flavor, sodium limits, and the specific food matrix.

## How is Dimagnesium diphosphate made?
Dimagnesium diphosphate is the magnesium salt of diphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid. In industrial practice, phosphate salts are produced from food‑grade phosphoric acid and suitable magnesium compounds; diphosphates are then obtained by controlled thermal dehydration (conversion of orthophosphates to pyrophosphates), and must meet EU identity and purity specifications for E450viii.[^2][^1]

## Is Dimagnesium diphosphate safe to eat?
EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, re‑evaluated phosphates (including E450 diphosphates) in 2019 and set a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 40 mg per kg body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus from all phosphate additives.[^2] E450viii is authorized in the EU subject to use‑level restrictions and strict purity criteria laid down in the additive specifications.[^1] People with kidney problems may be advised to limit phosphorus intake in general, which includes phosphorus from phosphate additives.[^4]

ADI means the amount that can be consumed every day over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Dimagnesium diphosphate have any benefits?
- Baking performance: helps control when and how fast carbon dioxide is released in leavened products, supporting even rise and fine crumb.
- Cheese texture: acts as an emulsifying salt, helping proteins and fats blend for smooth, sliceable processed cheese.
- Sodium reduction: as a magnesium salt, it contributes no sodium, which can support low‑sodium formulations.

These are technological, not health, benefits.

## Who should avoid Dimagnesium diphosphate?
- People on phosphate‑restricted diets, especially those with chronic kidney disease, should follow medical advice about limiting phosphorus from all sources, including additives.[^4]
- Individuals advised to limit phosphate additives specifically should check labels for “E450” or “dimagnesium diphosphate.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All phosphates are preservatives.” Fact: Diphosphates like E450viii are mainly leavening agents, acidity regulators, and emulsifying salts; they are not primarily used to kill microbes.
- Myth: “E450viii adds a lot of sodium.” Fact: Dimagnesium diphosphate contains magnesium, not sodium.
- Myth: “Phosphate additives are unregulated.” Fact: In the EU they are authorized with defined uses, maximum levels, and strict purity criteria.[^3][^1]

## Dimagnesium diphosphate in branded foods
You’re most likely to find E450viii on ingredient lists for baking powders, self‑raising flours, cake mixes, crackers, cookies, and processed cheese slices or spreads. To check, scan for “E450”, “E450viii”, or “dimagnesium diphosphate.” If you’re managing phosphorus intake, compare similar products—some use alternative leavening acids or emulsifying salts.
