    {
      "q": "is nitrosyl chloride polar",
      "a": "Yes—NOCl is a polar molecule due to its bent geometry at nitrogen and the differing electronegativities of O and Cl, which produce a net dipole.",

    {
      "q": "(b) in which species (no2cl or no3-) are the n-o bond(s) longer? nitrosyl chloride nitrate ion",
      "a": "Longer in nitrate (NO3−): its N–O bonds have lower bond order (~1.33) than the N=O double bond in nitrosyl chloride, so they are longer.",

    {
      "q": "how is nitrosyl chloride used",
      "a": "As the additive E919 it was historically used as a flour treatment/bleaching agent, but this use is now largely discontinued and not authorized in the EU; today it is mainly an industrial chlorinating/nitrosating reagent rather than a common food additive.",

    {
      "q": "nitrosyl chloride nocl decomposes to nitric oxide and chlorine when heated answer l",
      "a": "Yes—on heating, 2 NOCl → 2 NO + Cl2, and the decomposition is promoted by heat and light.",

    {
      "q": "question 6 what is the \"axe\" description of the nitrosyl chloride molecule?",
      "a": "AX2E1 at the nitrogen center (two bonded atoms and one lone pair), giving trigonal planar electron geometry and a bent molecular shape.",
