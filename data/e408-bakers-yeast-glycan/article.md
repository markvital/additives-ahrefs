Bakers yeast glycan (E408) is a carbohydrate taken from the cell wall of baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is rich in beta‑glucans, which are long chains of sugar units that behave like dietary fiber and can help shape texture in foods.

It is used in some foods to add body, help keep mixtures stable, and contribute fiber, often appearing on labels as yeast beta‑glucan rather than by its E‑number.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural polysaccharide (long-chain carbohydrate) from baker’s yeast cell walls, mainly made of beta‑glucans.
- What it does in food: Adds thickness and body, helps keep water and oil mixed, and can steady foams and suspensions.
- Where you might see it: Bakery items, beverages, soups, sauces, dairy-style products, and nutrition drinks.
- Label names: “Yeast beta‑glucan,” “bakers yeast glycan,” or simply “beta‑glucan” from yeast; the E‑number is less commonly used on retail packs.
- Dietary notes: Yeast‑derived; typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans. People with yeast allergies should avoid it.

## Why is Bakers yeast glycan added to food?
Food makers use bakers yeast glycan to improve texture and stability. It can thicken liquids, help emulsify (keep oil and water mixed), and support foams, which improves mouthfeel in drinks, soups, and sauces. It is also used as a source of dietary fiber in some formulations.[^2]

## What foods contain Bakers yeast glycan?
You can find yeast beta‑glucan in:
- Breads, tortillas, and baked goods
- Ready-to-drink beverages and powdered drink mixes
- Soups and sauces
- Dairy and dairy‑style products (such as smoothies or yogurt‑type snacks)
- Meal replacements and nutrition bars

These uses and categories are described in U.S. Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notices and in EU documents that list yeast beta‑glucans as a novel food ingredient.[^2][^3]

## What can replace Bakers yeast glycan?
Depending on the job it does in a recipe, common stand‑ins include:
- Texture and thickening: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [cellulose](/e460-cellulose)
- Emulsifying and mouthfeel: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), certain plant fibers, or starches
- Fiber contribution: oat beta‑glucan, inulin, or other dietary fibers

The best substitute depends on the food, the processing conditions, and label goals.

## How is Bakers yeast glycan made?
Bakers yeast glycan is isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the same species used in baking. Manufacturers break open yeast cells, separate the cell wall material, and remove unwanted parts (like proteins and nucleic acids). Water washes and food‑grade treatments help purify the beta‑glucan‑rich fraction, which is then dried into a powder for use in foods.[^1]

## Is Bakers yeast glycan safe to eat?
Safety evaluations in the EU concluded that yeast beta‑glucans are safe for use at the proposed levels in specified food categories.[^1] The ingredient is also listed in the EU Union list of novel foods with defined specifications and conditions of use.[^3] As with other fibers, eating large amounts at once may cause temporary gas or bloating in sensitive people.

## Does Bakers yeast glycan have any benefits?
- Formulation: It can improve body and creaminess, stabilize emulsions and foams, and reduce phase separation in drinks and sauces.
- Nutrition: As a nondigestible carbohydrate, it can contribute to total dietary fiber intake when included at meaningful levels in a product.
- Labeling: It is yeast‑derived rather than synthetic, which may suit certain clean‑label targets.

## Who should avoid Bakers yeast glycan?
- Individuals with known yeast allergies or sensitivities.
- People told to limit fiber (for example, before certain medical tests) should check with their clinician.
- Infants and young children should only consume products intended for them, as formulas and baby foods have specific rules.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s live yeast.” False. The yeast is processed; no live yeast remains in the purified glycan.
- “E‑numbers mean artificial.” False. An E‑number is just a code used to identify a food additive. It can be natural, nature‑identical, or synthetic.
- “It contains gluten.” False. It is derived from yeast, not grains. However, always check the label for any allergen statements.
- “It’s the same as MSG.” False. Beta‑glucans are carbohydrates, not glutamate or flavor enhancers.

## Bakers yeast glycan in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll usually see “yeast beta‑glucan,” “bakers yeast glycan,” or “beta‑glucan (from yeast).” It most often appears in bakery products, beverages, soups, dairy‑style foods, and nutrition shakes, where it helps with texture and stability. In many markets, companies list the ingredient by name rather than using the code E408.
