      "q": "what is blue 1 made of",
      "a": "A synthetic triarylmethane dye used as a food color; it's the disodium salt of a sulfonated aromatic compound and is water‑soluble. An insoluble 'lake' form is made by depositing the dye onto aluminum hydroxide for use in fats and coatings.",

    {
      "q": "how is blue 1 made",
      "a": "It’s synthesized from petroleum‑derived aromatic compounds by constructing a triarylmethane core, then sulfonating and oxidizing it to a water‑soluble disodium salt. The 'lake' form is produced by precipitating the dye onto aluminum hydroxide.",

    {
      "q": "does blue 1 cause cancer",
      "a": "Current evidence does not show that Blue 1 causes cancer at permitted food-use levels. Long-term animal studies and evaluations by EFSA/JECFA have not identified carcinogenic or genotoxic concerns.",
