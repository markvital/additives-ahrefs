      "q": "what are the roles of glycoproteins and glycolipids",
      "a": "In foods, glycolipids (E246) act as surface‑active emulsifiers and stabilizers that help oil and water mix and keep textures uniform; glycoproteins in food ingredients can also aid emulsifying and foaming, but they are not the E-number additive here.",

    {
      "q": "what do glycolipids do",
      "a": "E246 glycolipids are microbial biosurfactants used to emulsify and stabilize foods and beverages, improving dispersion of fats, flavors, and colors and preventing separation.",

    {
      "q": "why are glycolipids and glycoproteins important?",
      "a": "They help make products stable and consistent—E246 creates stable emulsions/foams and improves texture, while natural glycoproteins in ingredients can provide complementary stabilization.",

    {
      "q": "are glycolipids bad for you",
      "a": "No—E246 is authorized in the EU and considered safe at permitted levels; typical food uses are low and not associated with adverse effects.",

    },
    {
      "q": "why the roles of glycoproteins and glycolipids",
      "a": "Because oil and water don’t naturally mix, these molecules lower surface tension and bind at interfaces to keep foods homogeneous; E246 specifically provides this emulsifying/stabilizing function in formulations.",
