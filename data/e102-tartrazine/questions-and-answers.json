      "a": "At permitted food-use levels, tartrazine (FD&C Yellow 5) is considered safe by regulators (ADI up to 7.5 mg/kg body weight/day). A small number of people—especially those with aspirin sensitivity—may have hives or asthma-like reactions, and the EU requires a label about possible effects on activity and attention in children.",

      "q": "what is yellow 5 made of",
      "a": "It is a synthetic azo dye: the trisodium salt of a sulfonated aromatic azo compound based on a pyrazolone ring (C.I. 19140). It is produced from petroleum-derived intermediates such as sulfonated anilines and a pyrazolone derivative.",

    {
      "q": "how is yellow 5 made",
      "a": "Industrially, sulfanilic acid (or similar sulfonated anilines) is diazotized and azo-coupled to a pyrazolone derivative, then neutralized to form the trisodium salt. Lake forms are made by precipitating the dye onto an insoluble substrate such as aluminum hydroxide.",
