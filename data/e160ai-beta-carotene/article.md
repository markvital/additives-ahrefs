Beta-carotene (E160a(i)) is a bright yellow–orange color used in many foods and drinks. It’s the same natural pigment that makes carrots orange, and the body can convert it into vitamin A. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow its use as a food color when good manufacturing practices are followed.

## At a glance
- What it is: Beta-carotene is a carotenoid pigment used as a yellow to orange food color (E-number E160a(i)).
- What it looks like: Orange crystals or powder; typically dispersed in oil or emulsions.
- Where it comes from: Made by chemical synthesis, extracted from plants, or produced by fermentation; see related entries like [plant carotenes](/e160aii-plant-carotenes) and [beta-carotene from Blakeslea trispora](/e160aiii-beta-carotene-from-blakeslea-trispora).
- What it does in food: Colors products from pale yellow to deep orange; works well in fat-containing foods.
- Common uses: Drinks, dairy products, bakery items, spreads, confectionery.
- Dietary notes: Typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans; check labels for carriers in specific products.

## Why is Beta-carotene added to food?
Food makers add beta-carotene to give foods and beverages a consistent yellow–orange hue and to replace or enhance the natural color that may fade during processing or storage.[^1]

## What foods contain Beta-carotene?
In the United States, beta-carotene is a color additive exempt from certification and is permitted for use in foods generally, at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice. That means you can find it across many categories, such as beverages, dairy, spreads, baked goods, soups, and confections.[^1]

## What can replace Beta-carotene?
- Other natural colors with similar shades:
  - [Annatto](/e160b-annatto)
  - [Paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
  - [Curcumin (turmeric)](/e100-curcumin)
  - [Lutein](/e161b-lutein)
- Related carotenoids that yield orange tones:
  - [Beta-apo-8’-carotenal (C30)](/e160e-beta-apo-8-carotenal-c30)
- Darker browns if desired:
  - [Caramel color](/e150a-plain-caramel)

Choice depends on label goals (natural vs. synthetic), target shade, solubility, light/heat stability, and cost.

## How is Beta-carotene made?
Regulations recognize several sources: chemically synthesized beta-carotene, beta-carotene produced by fermentation (for example, using the fungus Blakeslea trispora), and carotenes obtained from plant materials (often labeled as “mixed carotenes”).[^2] In food use, beta-carotene is fat-soluble, so it’s commonly delivered in oils or as emulsions and beadlets to help it disperse evenly in recipes.[^3]

## Is Beta-carotene safe to eat?
Beta-carotene is allowed as a food color by U.S. and EU regulators when used according to good manufacturing practice and official purity specifications.[^2] As a provitamin A carotenoid, it has a long history of safe use in foods; however, high-dose beta-carotene supplements have shown risks in certain groups (see below).[^4]

## Does Beta-carotene have any benefits?
Beta-carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid. The body can convert it to vitamin A, which supports normal vision, immune function, and skin health.[^4] Eating or drinking products colored with beta-carotene contributes only small amounts; meaningful vitamin A intake comes from overall diet and, if needed, supplements.

## Who should avoid Beta-carotene?
- People who smoke or have heavy asbestos exposure should avoid high-dose beta-carotene supplements because large clinical trials found an increased risk of lung cancer in these groups.[^5]
- Very high intakes from diet or supplements can cause carotenodermia (a harmless yellow-orange skin tint) that fades when intake is reduced.[^4]

These concerns are about high-dose supplements, not the small amounts used to color foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Beta-carotene is the same as vitamin A.” Fact: It’s a provitamin A; the body converts it to vitamin A as needed.[^4]
- Myth: “All beta-carotene is natural.” Fact: Regulations allow beta-carotene made by synthesis, fermentation, or from plant sources.[^2]
- Myth: “Beta-carotene dissolves in water.” Fact: It is fat-soluble and is usually added via oils, emulsions, or beadlets for even coloring.[^3]

## Beta-carotene in branded foods
You’ll often see beta-carotene in ingredient lists for soft drinks and juices, dairy products (like yogurts and processed cheeses), margarine and spreads, breakfast cereals, and sweets. On labels it may appear as “beta-carotene,” “carotene (color),” or “E160a” in regions that use E-numbers. Related entries you might see are [plant carotenes](/e160aii-plant-carotenes) and [beta-carotene from Blakeslea trispora](/e160aiii-beta-carotene-from-blakeslea-trispora).
