Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil is a plant‑based emulsifier made by reacting fully hydrogenated rapeseed (canola) oil with glycerol. It helps oil and water mix, keeps textures smooth, and improves shelf life in many foods. You’ll often meet it in the trade as a high‑monoglyceride emulsifier.

## At a glance
- What it is: a high‑monoacylglycerol emulsifier made from fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil and glycerol
- What it does: stabilizes emulsions, improves crumb and softness, prevents oiling‑out, and slows staling
- Where it’s used: bakery items, spreads and margarines, confectionery coatings, ice cream, and drink mixes
- Dietary notes: plant‑derived and typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans
- Label hints: may appear as “mono- and diglycerides,” “distilled monoglycerides,” or “emulsifier E471” (from rapeseed)

## Why is Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil added to food?
Food makers use this ingredient to keep oil and water mixed, to make textures soft and cohesive, and to stop fat from separating. In doughs and batters it strengthens the structure and gives a finer, more even crumb. In cold or frozen products, it helps prevent ice crystal growth and keeps a creamy mouthfeel.

## What foods contain Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil?
You’re most likely to find it in:
- Bread, buns, tortillas, and cakes
- Margarines, low‑fat spreads, and filled creams
- Chocolatey and yogurt‑style coatings, caramels, and toffees
- Ice creams, frozen desserts, and dairy alternatives
- Powdered beverage mixes, creamers, and instant desserts

Regulators group this kind of ingredient with mono‑ and diglyceride emulsifiers, which are permitted in a wide range of food categories when used as intended.[^2]

## What can replace Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil?
Possible stand‑ins depend on the recipe:
- Other mono‑ and diglyceride emulsifiers, such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or “distilled monoglycerides”
- Lecithins like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (from soy or sunflower)
- Lactylates such as [sodium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) for bread
- Sugar‑based emulsifiers like [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids) or [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) in confectionery
- Modified versions of monoglycerides such as [citric acid esters of mono‑ and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)

Each choice has its own strengths, so formulators match the emulsifier to the food and process.

## How is Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil made?
- Start with refined, fully hydrogenated rapeseed (canola) oil. Full hydrogenation saturates the fatty acids and, unlike partial hydrogenation, does not create trans fat.[^3]
- React the fat with excess glycerol (a process called glycerolysis). This makes a mixture rich in mono‑ and diglycerides; “superglycerinated” simply means the process is tuned to yield especially high monoglyceride content.[^4]
- Purify the product (neutralize, bleach, deodorize) to give a bland, easy‑to‑use emulsifier suitable for foods.[^4]

These steps mirror how regulated mono‑ and diglyceride emulsifiers are specified in the EU and elsewhere.[^4]

## Is Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil safe to eat?
In the United States, mono‑ and diglycerides are affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the scientific panel re‑evaluating mono‑ and diglycerides (E 471) found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels.[^2] Also, FDA has determined that partially hydrogenated oils (the main dietary source of artificial trans fat) are no longer GRAS; this does not apply to fully hydrogenated oils used to make this ingredient.[^3]

## Does Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil have any benefits?
From a food‑making point of view, yes. It strengthens and stabilizes emulsions, improves dough handling, helps create a fine, soft crumb in bakery items, and keeps frozen desserts smooth. It can also reduce fat “bloom” or oiling‑out in coatings and fillings, helping products look and feel better over shelf life.

## Who should avoid Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil?
- People limiting added fats may wish to moderate foods that contain many emulsified fats, even though this emulsifier is used at low levels.
- Those who prefer to avoid emulsifiers in general can check labels for “mono‑ and diglycerides” or “emulsifier E471.”
- It is plant‑derived and typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans. If you follow strict dietary rules (for example, for religious certification), look for the appropriate mark on the package.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Hydrogenated” always means trans fat. Fact: Full hydrogenation produces saturated fats and, unlike partial hydrogenation, does not create trans fat.[^3]
- Myth: It’s animal‑based. Fact: This ingredient is made from rapeseed (canola) oil and glycerol, so it is plant‑derived.
- Myth: It adds a strong “canola” taste. Fact: Food‑grade emulsifiers are highly purified and used at very low levels, so they are designed to be neutral in flavor.

## Superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you may see it named in several ways:
- “Mono‑ and diglycerides,” “distilled monoglycerides,” or “emulsifier E471”
- “Mono‑ and diglycerides (rapeseed)” or “from fully hydrogenated rapeseed oil”
- Less often, “superglycerinated hydrogenated rapeseed oil”

If your product shopping is purpose‑driven (vegan, clean‑label, allergen‑aware), scan the ingredient list carefully and check the brand’s FAQ for sourcing details.
