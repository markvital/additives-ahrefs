Calcium stearoyl fumarate (E486) is a food additive used mainly as an emulsifier and dough conditioner. It helps mix ingredients that don’t naturally blend, such as oil and water, and can support consistent texture in processed foods.

## At a glance
- E-number: E486; name on labels: “calcium stearoyl fumarate” or “E486”
- What it does: emulsifier and dough conditioner that helps ingredients blend and keeps texture uniform
- Where it shows up: selected processed foods (often bakery mixes), when permitted by local rules
- Regulation: identity and purity are set in EU law; actual uses and limits depend on the country

## Why is Calcium stearoyl fumarate added to food?
Manufacturers use E486 to help fat and water mix, stabilize batter or dough, and improve handling during processing. In the international Codex system, calcium stearoyl fumarate is listed as an emulsifier, a class of additives that help keep mixtures from separating.[^1] In practical terms, emulsifiers can improve mixing, texture, and shelf stability in certain recipes.[^2]

## What foods contain Calcium stearoyl fumarate?
When authorized, E486 is used in selected processed foods where emulsification or dough conditioning is helpful—most commonly in bakery products and dry mixes. The Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) lists calcium stearoyl fumarate with permitted uses in specific food categories; national and regional rules may be narrower or differ.[^1] Always check the ingredient list: it may appear as “calcium stearoyl fumarate” or “E486.”

## What can replace Calcium stearoyl fumarate?
Possible functional alternatives depend on the recipe and labeling goals:
- Emulsifiers for baking: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [mono- and diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Texture aids: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- Dough conditioners (where allowed): [L-cysteine](/e920-l-cysteine)

## How is Calcium stearoyl fumarate made?
Chemically, E486 is the calcium salt of stearoyl fumaric acid. It is produced from fumaric acid ([E297](/e297-fumaric-acid)) and long-chain fatty acids (often from the [fatty acids](/e570-fatty-acids) pool), then neutralized with calcium to form the calcium salt. In the European Union, detailed identity and purity specifications for E486 are laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

## Is Calcium stearoyl fumarate safe to eat?
In the EU, food additives are authorized only after safety evaluation, and each additive must meet strict identity and purity specifications. Calcium stearoyl fumarate has EU specifications and, where it is permitted for use, must comply with the applicable maximum levels set in food law.[^4][^5] As with any additive, actual exposure depends on how much is used in foods and how often those foods are eaten.

## Does Calcium stearoyl fumarate have any benefits?
For manufacturers, E486 can make processing more reliable by helping ingredients blend and by improving dough or batter handling. For consumers, this can mean more consistent texture and quality in the finished product. These are typical roles of emulsifiers in foods.[^2]

## Who should avoid Calcium stearoyl fumarate?
- People who prefer to avoid emulsifiers in general may choose products labeled without them.
- Those with specific dietary practices (vegan, vegetarian, or certain religious diets) may wish to ask suppliers about the source of the fatty acids used.
- E486 is not one of the nine major allergens that require special labeling in the United States (milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, and sesame).[^6]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are a warning sign.” Fact: An E-number simply means the additive is authorized for use in the EU and has specifications and conditions set in law.[^7]
- Myth: “Calcium stearoyl fumarate is the same as calcium stearate.” Fact: They are different substances with different specifications and uses; calcium stearate is part of the “salts of fatty acids” group, while E486 is stearoyl fumarate with its own EU specification.[^3][e470aiii-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids]
- Myth: “If it’s an emulsifier, it must be unnecessary.” Fact: Emulsifiers can make foods safer and more consistent by helping ingredients mix evenly and stay stable during shelf life.[^2]

## Calcium stearoyl fumarate in branded foods
Look for “calcium stearoyl fumarate” or “E486” in the ingredient list. It may appear alongside other emulsifiers or dough conditioners. Because use varies by country and product type, not every bakery mix or processed food will contain it.
