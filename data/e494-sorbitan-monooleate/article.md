Sorbitan monooleate (E494) is a food-grade emulsifier that helps oil and water stay mixed. It is widely used to keep sauces, bakery fillings, and desserts smooth and stable without adding flavor. Regulators have evaluated it and set safe intake levels for its use in food.

## At a glance
- What it is: An ester of sorbitan (from sorbitol, a sugar alcohol) and oleic acid (a common fatty acid); a non‑ionic emulsifier and stabiliser.
- What it does: Keeps oil-in-water mixtures stable, improves texture, and helps prevent separation.
- Where it’s found: Baked goods and fillings, confectionery, sauces and dressings, dessert mixes, and some beverages.
- Other names: E494, Span 80.
- Dietary note: Usually sourced from vegetable oils; if source matters (e.g., vegan), check with the manufacturer.
- Regulatory status: Approved in the European Union with conditions and maximum levels; safety bodies have set an acceptable daily intake.

## Why is Sorbitan monooleate added to food?
Sorbitan monooleate is added because it is a non‑ionic (uncharged) emulsifier and stabiliser that helps disperse oils into water and maintain a uniform texture during processing, storage, and handling. It improves product consistency, reduces phase separation, and can work alongside other emulsifiers for a finer, more stable structure in foods like sauces and bakery items.[^1]

## What foods contain Sorbitan monooleate?
You’ll most often see E494 in products that blend fats with water: fine bakery wares and fillings, confectionery, desserts and dessert mixes, emulsified sauces and dressings, and certain beverages. In the European Union, its use is authorised in a range of food categories at set maximum levels under the food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Sorbitan monooleate?
Depending on the recipe and process, formulators may use:
- Other emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [polysorbate 80](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), or [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate).
- Hydrocolloids to help stabilize texture, like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum).

## How is Sorbitan monooleate made?
Commercially, sorbitol is first dehydrated to form sorbitan (a cyclic form), which is then esterified with food‑grade oleic acid derived from edible fats and oils. The result is mainly the mono‑ester, with small amounts of related esters permitted by purity specifications.[^3]

## Is Sorbitan monooleate safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated sorbitan esters (E 491–E 495) and established a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, expressed as sorbitan. EFSA concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels.[^1] The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has also evaluated sorbitan esters and set a group ADI in a similar range, expressed as sorbitan.[^4] ADI stands for acceptable daily intake—the amount considered safe to consume every day over a lifetime.

## Does Sorbitan monooleate have any benefits?
Its benefits are technological rather than nutritional. It helps foods stay mixed, improves mouthfeel, and supports consistent quality over shelf life. After ingestion, sorbitan monooleate can be hydrolysed (split) into sorbitan and fatty acids; the fatty acids are handled like normal dietary fats, and most sorbitan is excreted, which has informed past safety evaluations.[^4]

## Who should avoid Sorbitan monooleate?
- People following strict vegan or vegetarian diets may want to confirm that the oleic acid source is vegetable‑derived.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit emulsifiers, or who prefers additive‑free diets, may choose to avoid it.
- As with any ingredient, individuals who notice digestive sensitivity to emulsifiers should discuss options with a clinician.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E494 is the same as polysorbate 80.” Fact: E494 is sorbitan monooleate (a non‑ethoxylated sorbitan ester), while E433 (polysorbate 80) is polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate—an ethoxylated derivative with different specifications.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s derived from petroleum.” Fact: Food‑grade sorbitan monooleate is produced from sorbitol/sorbitan and edible fatty acids (such as oleic acid) from food fats and oils, under defined purity criteria.[^3]

## Sorbitan monooleate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “emulsifier: sorbitan monooleate” or “emulsifier: E494.” In the European Union, additives must be labelled by their functional class (such as “emulsifier”) followed by their specific name or E‑number.[^2]
