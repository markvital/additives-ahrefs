Ammonium chloride (E510) is an inorganic salt used in foods for its sharp, salty taste and its ability to control acidity. It is best known for giving “salmiak” or salty licorice its signature flavor, but it also has technical uses in some baked goods and beverages. It is authorized as a food additive in the European Union when meeting strict purity rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: A simple salt of ammonia and hydrochloric acid; white, highly soluble crystals with a salty, slightly astringent taste.
- What it does in food: Adds a distinct “salmiak” flavor, helps regulate acidity (pH), and can serve as a yeast nutrient in some doughs.
- Where you’ll see it: Salty licorice and licorice candies, some specialty baked goods, and a few flavored drinks.
- Label names: “Ammonium chloride” or “E510.”
- Dietary notes: Vegan and vegetarian friendly; contains no allergens by itself.

## Why is Ammonium chloride added to food?
Food makers add ammonium chloride to deliver a bold “salmiak” flavor and to help control acidity (pH) in certain recipes.[^1] It can also support yeast growth by providing a nitrogen source, which bakers sometimes use for specific doughs that benefit from strong fermentation.

## What foods contain Ammonium chloride?
You’ll most often find ammonium chloride in salty licorice confectionery, especially in Nordic and Baltic markets, and in some licorice-flavored candies elsewhere. It may also appear in specialty baked goods and certain beverages where a sharper taste or pH adjustment is desired, and it must comply with European Union rules on where and how it can be used.[^2]

## What can replace Ammonium chloride?
- For acidity control: Consider acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) to adjust pH.
- For yeast nutrition: Bakers sometimes use [ammonium phosphate](/e342-ammonium-phosphate) as an alternative nitrogen source.
- For licorice flavor: A blend of regular salt and licorice sweeteners such as [glycyrrhizin](/e958-glycyrrhizin) can mimic some aspects of the taste, though it won’t fully match classic “salmiak” candy.
- For leavening in crisp cookies/crackers: [Ammonium carbonates](/e503-ammonium-carbonates) or [sodium carbonates](/e500-sodium-carbonates) are leavening agents; note this is a different function from E510’s flavor/pH role.

## How is Ammonium chloride made?
Food‑grade ammonium chloride is typically produced by reacting ammonia (NH3) with hydrogen chloride (HCl), yielding ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), followed by purification to meet food specifications.[^3]

## Is Ammonium chloride safe to eat?
In the European Union, ammonium chloride is an authorized food additive and must meet identity and purity specifications, including limits for impurities.[^1] When used within the authorized food categories and levels, it is considered acceptable for consumption under EU law.[^2] As with many intense flavoring salts, very high amounts can taste harsh and may upset sensitive stomachs, so products are formulated to keep levels where consumers enjoy the flavor.

## Does Ammonium chloride have any benefits?
- Flavor: It delivers the characteristic salty‑licorice “salmiak” note that regular salt cannot provide.
- Function: It can fine‑tune pH in recipes, which may influence taste, color, and texture.
- Fermentation support: In some baking contexts, it can help yeast by providing nitrogen.

## Who should avoid Ammonium chloride?
- People who dislike or are sensitive to the strong “salmiak” flavor may prefer to avoid salty licorice products.
- Individuals advised to limit acid‑loading (for example, due to certain kidney conditions) should talk to a healthcare professional before regularly consuming high‑salmiak candies. This is general advice and not a medical diagnosis.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as ammonia.” Fact: Ammonium chloride is a stable salt; food‑grade material must meet strict identity and purity requirements.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s a leavening agent.” Fact: It doesn’t release carbon dioxide, so it’s not a leavening agent; that role is covered by additives like [ammonium carbonates](/e503-ammonium-carbonates).
- Myth: “It’s a ‘chemical,’ so it isn’t allowed in food.” Fact: It is a regulated food additive in the EU and can be used only in specific foods and amounts.[^2]

## Ammonium chloride in branded foods
- How to spot it: Check ingredient lists for “Ammonium chloride” or “E510.” Salty licorice candies often highlight “salmiak” on the front of pack.
- Regional note: Salty licorice is especially common in Northern Europe, but you can find these products in specialty shops worldwide.
- Shopping tip: If you prefer milder licorice, look for products flavored with licorice extract or [glycyrrhizin](/e958-glycyrrhizin) and without E510.
