Dicalcium diphosphate (E540) is a calcium salt of diphosphoric acid, also called calcium pyrophosphate. It helps control acidity, ties up trace metals, and can act as a slow leavening acid, but it appears far less often on labels today than other phosphate additives.

## At a glance
- What it is: A calcium salt of diphosphoric acid; also known as calcium pyrophosphate.
- What it does: Controls acidity (pH), binds metal ions (sequestrant), stabilizes mixes, and can serve as a slow-acting leavening acid in baking systems.
- Where it’s found: Rarely listed; if used, typically in some baking powders or dry mixes.
- Dietary notes: No calories. Supplies phosphorus and calcium in trace amounts but isn’t meant as a nutrient source.
- Safety snapshot: Phosphates as a group have a health-based limit; people who need to limit phosphorus (for example, with kidney disease) should watch total phosphate intake.

## Why is Dicalcium diphosphate added to food?
Dicalcium diphosphate fits into the phosphate family of additives. As a pyrophosphate, it can:
- Regulate acidity (pH) in foods and beverages so flavor and texture stay consistent[^1]
- Act as a sequestrant, tying up metal ions that could cause off-flavors or discoloration[^1]
- Work as a slow-acting leavening acid in dry baking mixes, pairing with bases like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)
- Help stabilize dry blends by being relatively insoluble, which supports even distribution

EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) lists these roles broadly for phosphate additives (phosphoric acid, phosphates, and diphosphates), which include acidity regulation, sequestration, stabilization, and raising effects.[^1]

## What foods contain Dicalcium diphosphate?
You may find it—though not commonly—in:
- Some baking powders and cake or pancake mixes
- Dry blends where slow, controlled leavening is desired
- Occasional specialized applications where a calcium-based pyrophosphate is preferred

On labels, it might appear as “dicalcium diphosphate,” “calcium pyrophosphate,” or “E540.”

## What can replace Dicalcium diphosphate?
Depending on the job you need it to do, these are common substitutes:
- Leavening acids: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) (various), or [glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone)
- pH control: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Sequestration/buffering: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)

The “best” replacement depends on solubility, flavor impact, and when you want the reaction to occur (immediate vs. during baking).

## How is Dicalcium diphosphate made?
Chemically, dicalcium diphosphate is calcium pyrophosphate with the formula Ca2P2O7. It’s the calcium salt of diphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid and is related to other pyrophosphates used in food technology.[^2] Industrially, calcium pyrophosphate can be produced by thermally condensing suitable calcium phosphate precursors to form the pyrophosphate structure.

## Is Dicalcium diphosphate safe to eat?
Safety for this ingredient is tied to overall phosphate intake from all sources. EFSA established a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day (expressed as phosphorus) and noted that total intake can approach or exceed this level in some consumers, depending on diet.[^1] People with chronic kidney disease are often advised to limit phosphorus (especially from additives), in consultation with their health care provider.[^3]

## Does Dicalcium diphosphate have any benefits?
- In food processing, it offers functional benefits: pH control, metal ion binding, and slow, steady leavening in certain dry mixes.
- Nutritionally, it contains phosphorus and calcium, but foods do not typically use it as a mineral supplement. Phosphorus is an essential mineral for bones, teeth, and energy metabolism; however, most diets already provide sufficient phosphorus without relying on additives.[^3]

## Who should avoid Dicalcium diphosphate?
- Individuals who are advised to follow low-phosphorus diets, including many people with reduced kidney function
- Anyone instructed by a clinician to limit phosphate additives
- Caregivers managing specialized diets (e.g., renal diets) should review ingredient lists and choose lower-phosphate options when needed

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s the same as [dicalcium phosphate](/e341ii-dicalcium-phosphate).  
  Fact: Both contain calcium and phosphorus, but they differ chemically. Dicalcium phosphate is a phosphate (orthophosphate), while dicalcium diphosphate is a pyrophosphate with different properties in food.
- Myth: All phosphates are fast leavening agents.  
  Fact: Reaction speed varies. Some are quick; others, like dicalcium diphosphate, can react more slowly, which is useful in dry mixes.
- Myth: If an additive contains calcium, it’s automatically a good calcium source.  
  Fact: The amounts used for technical effects are usually too small to be meaningful nutritionally.

## Dicalcium diphosphate in branded foods
- Where to look on labels: ingredients lists on baking powders, cake mixes, and other dry blends. It may be listed as “dicalcium diphosphate,” “calcium pyrophosphate,” or “E540.”
- Related names you might also see on similar products: other phosphate leavening acids such as [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) or [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), and bases like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate).
- Tip: If you’re minimizing phosphate additives, compare brands and choose options using acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone) where suitable for the recipe.
