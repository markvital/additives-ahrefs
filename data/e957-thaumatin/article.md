Thaumatin (E957) is a very sweet-tasting protein extracted from the fruit of the West African plant Thaumatococcus daniellii. It is used in tiny amounts to sweeten and to improve flavors in many foods and drinks, often alongside other sweeteners.<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant-derived protein sweetener and flavor modifier (E957).
- How sweet: about 1,600–3,000 times sweeter than table sugar by weight; sweetness builds slowly and lingers.
- Where you’ll find it: sugar-free gum, flavored waters, desserts, dairy products, and lozenges.
- Why it’s used: strong sweetness at very low doses, helps smooth harsh notes from other sweeteners.
- Safety: evaluated by EU authorities with no safety concern at typical intakes.

## Why is Thaumatin added to food?
Thaumatin gives intense sweetness at very low levels, so manufacturers can reduce sugar while keeping a pleasant taste.[^2] It also works as a flavor modifier, helping to mask bitterness or metallic notes from other sweeteners, and it has a slow-onset, lingering sweetness that can round out flavor profiles.[^2]

## What foods contain Thaumatin?
Thaumatin appears in a wide range of products where mild, long-lasting sweetness or flavor smoothing is helpful, such as:
- Sugar-free or reduced-sugar chewing gum and mints
- Flavored waters, soft drinks, and powdered beverages
- Dairy desserts and yogurts
- Confectionery, throat lozenges, and nutritional products

International standards list thaumatin (INS 957) for use in many food categories, typically at very low levels alongside other sweeteners.[^3] In the EU, it is an authorised food additive (E957).[^4] On labels you may see “thaumatin,” “E957,” or both.

## What can replace Thaumatin?
There are many options, each with its own taste and use profile:
- High‑intensity sweeteners: [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides), [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [saccharin](/e954-saccharin-and-its-salts), [aspartame](/e951-aspartame), and [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k).
- Sugar alcohols (polyols): [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), and [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol).

Food makers often blend thaumatin with these to fine‑tune sweetness, aftertaste, and stability.

## How is Thaumatin made?
EU specifications define thaumatin as a mixture of sweet-tasting proteins obtained by water extraction from the arils (the fleshy seed coverings) of Thaumatococcus daniellii fruit, followed by purification and drying.[^1] Typical steps include aqueous extraction, filtration and/or ion‑exchange purification, concentration, and spray‑drying to a powder that meets set purity and microbiological criteria.[^1]

## Is Thaumatin safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated thaumatin (E957) and concluded there is no safety concern for its use as a food additive at reported exposure levels; an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^2] EFSA also noted that while rare cases of occupational sensitisation from inhaling thaumatin powder have been reported, this has not been a concern for consumers through normal dietary intake.[^2]

## Does Thaumatin have any benefits?
- Helps reduce added sugar because it is intensely sweet at very low amounts.
- Adds negligible calories at typical use levels due to the tiny quantities needed.
- Can improve overall taste by softening bitterness or metallic notes from other sweeteners.

## Who should avoid Thaumatin?
Most people do not need to avoid thaumatin. Individuals who work with thaumatin powder and have respiratory allergies should follow workplace safety guidance to prevent inhalation exposure.[^2] If you prefer to avoid high‑intensity sweeteners in general, check ingredient lists for “thaumatin” or “E957.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Thaumatin is an artificial chemical.
  Fact: It is a naturally occurring protein extracted from a tropical fruit.
- Myth: It’s just like sugar.  
  Fact: It is 1,600–3,000 times sweeter by weight and has a slower, longer‑lasting sweetness.
- Myth: It leaves a strong licorice taste in everything.  
  Fact: Some people notice a mild lingering note; careful blending can minimise this.
- Myth: It hasn’t been evaluated for safety.  
  Fact: It has undergone formal safety reviews by European authorities.

## Thaumatin in branded foods
You’ll often find thaumatin in sugar‑free gum, flavored waters, dairy desserts, and lozenges, usually alongside other sweeteners like [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k), [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides), or polyols such as [erythritol](/e968-erythritol) and [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol). On ingredient lists, look for “thaumatin” or “E957.”
