      "q": "is benzoic acid soluble in water",
      "a": "Only sparingly—about 3 g per liter at room temperature; its solubility increases in hot water and it dissolves readily in many organic solvents.",

    {
      "q": "is benzoic acid polar",
      "a": "It has a polar carboxyl group but a nonpolar aromatic ring, so overall it’s only weakly polar; its benzoate salt is much more polar and water‑soluble.",

      "q": "is benzoic acid bad for you",
      "a": "At approved food levels it’s considered safe, with an ADI of 0–5 mg/kg body weight/day; some people may experience irritation or hypersensitivity, and benzene formation in certain acidic drinks is monitored and kept very low.",
