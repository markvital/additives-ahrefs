      "q": "how to use sodium silicate in pottery",
      "a": "Use it as a deflocculant by adding very small amounts (often with a little soda ash) to clay slip until the desired specific gravity/viscosity is reached; it can also be brushed on and the surface stretched to create crackle textures—wear gloves and avoid over‑addition.",

      "q": "is sodium silicate safe for skin",
      "a": "Undiluted or moderately concentrated sodium silicate is not skin‑safe because it’s caustic; only very dilute formulations (as in some cosmetics) are used on skin, and even then may cause irritation in sensitive individuals.",
