Pectin amide (E440b) is a plant-derived thickener and gelling agent made by modifying natural pectin. It helps foods set and stay stable, especially in fruit-based products and low-sugar recipes. Regulators in the EU and US permit its use in foods when made and used as specified.

## At a glance
Here is the quick profile of pectin amide.

- What it is: A form of pectin in which some acid groups are converted to amides; also called amidated pectin
- E-number: E440b (also written as E440ii)
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, and gelling agent
- Where it comes from: Made from pectin extracted from citrus peels or apple pomace
- Typical uses: Fruit spreads, fillings, dairy desserts, confectionery, and acidic beverages
- Dietary notes: Plant-based and suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets in typical production
- On labels you might see: “pectin amide,” “amidated pectin,” “E440b,” or “E440ii”

## Why is pectin amide added to food?
Food makers use pectin amide to build body, create gels, and prevent separation. Compared with regular [pectin](/e440-pectins), it can gel at lower sugar levels and is especially good at forming calcium-set, heat-reversible gels—useful for low-sugar jams, fruit preparations, and creamy desserts.[^2]

## What foods contain pectin amide?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Jams, jellies, fruit spreads, and pie fillings (especially reduced-sugar versions)
- Spoonable and drinkable yogurts, dairy desserts, and plant-based desserts
- Confectionery with fruit phases, glazes, or soft gels
- Sauces, condiments, and acidic beverages to improve mouthfeel and stability

## What can replace pectin amide?
Alternatives depend on the texture and processing you need:
- For smooth thickening: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- For firm gels: [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [agar](/e406-agar), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- For fruit systems and dairy synergy: [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum)
- For acidic gels and beverages: [processed eucheuma seaweed](/e407a-processed-eucheuma-seaweed)
- For body and viscosity: [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch)
- For a direct counterpart: non‑amidated [pectin](/e440a-pectin) or [non‑amidated pectines](/e440i-non-amidated-pectines)

## How is pectin amide made?
Manufacturers first extract pectin from citrus peels or apple pomace. They then partially convert (amidate) some of the pectin’s carboxyl groups by treating it with ammonia, producing “amidated pectin.” The degree of amidation is controlled and, by specification, does not exceed about one-quarter of the available carboxyl groups, which helps fine‑tune gel behavior.[^4] Ethanol or isopropanol may be used during processing and purification, and specifications limit residuals and set quality criteria such as galacturonic acid content, ash, and loss on drying.[^2]

## Is pectin amide safe to eat?
European authorities re‑evaluated pectin and amidated pectin and concluded there is no safety concern for the general population at the reported uses and use levels.[^1] In the United States, pectin is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice for its intended technical effects.[^3]

## Does pectin amide have any benefits?
- In recipes, it enables reliable gels with less sugar and helps stabilize fruit pieces in fillings and yogurts.
- It can improve texture and reduce syneresis (weeping) in refrigerated or frozen products.
- It contributes a small amount of soluble fiber to foods, though the added amounts are usually modest.

## Who should avoid pectin amide?
- People advised to limit dietary fiber (for example, under certain medical diets) may need to check products thickened with pectin-type gums.
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to pectin-containing products should avoid it, though such reactions are uncommon.
- For infants and very young children, product use should follow age-appropriate guidance from healthcare professionals and the product label.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Pectin amide is synthetic.” Fact: It is made by modifying plant pectin extracted from citrus or apple by a controlled amidation step.[^2]
- Myth: “All pectins work the same.” Fact: Amidated pectin gels differently than standard pectin, especially in low‑sugar and calcium‑rich systems.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s only for jams.” Fact: It also stabilizes dairy desserts, fruit preparations, confections, and some beverages.

## pectin amide in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “pectin amide,” “amidated pectin,” “E440b,” or “E440ii.” Many fruit spreads, yogurts with fruit, pudding‑style desserts, and fruit‑filled bakery items use it for consistent set and clean slices. If a product highlights “reduced sugar” or “no added sugar” in a fruit gel, amidated pectin is a common choice.
