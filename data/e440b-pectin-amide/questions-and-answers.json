      "q": "how to tell if your pectin is amidated",
      "a": "Check the ingredient list or spec sheet: amidated pectin is labeled “amidated pectin,” “LM amidated,” or E440b (sometimes with a degree of amidation/DA); if it says E440a or just “pectin/high‑methoxyl pectin,” it’s non‑amidated. Consumer clue: amidated LM pectin typically gels with a small amount of added calcium and works in low‑sugar recipes, whereas “regular/classic” pectin that needs lots of sugar is non‑amidated HM.",

      "q": "what is non-amidated pectin",
      "a": "Non‑amidated pectin (E440a) is pectin whose carboxyl groups aren’t converted to amides; it exists as high‑methoxyl (gels with high sugar and low pH) and low‑methoxyl non‑amidated (gels with calcium). Unlike amidated pectin, it usually requires more sugar (HM) or more calcium (LM) and forms less heat‑reversible gels.",
