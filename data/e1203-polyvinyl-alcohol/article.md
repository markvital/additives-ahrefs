Polyvinyl alcohol (E1203) is a water-soluble, synthetic polymer used mainly as a film-forming coating and thickener in foods and dietary supplements. It helps tablet and candy surfaces stay smooth, resist moisture, and avoid sticking.

## At a glance
- What it is: A synthetic, water-soluble polymer also called PVOH or PVAl; used as a film former, glazing agent, and thickener.
- What it does: Builds glossy, protective coatings; controls stickiness and moisture; helps tablets and capsules go down easier.
- Where it’s found: Mostly on coated tablets and capsules for foods or supplements, and sometimes on shiny sugar-coated confectionery.
- How it’s made: Produced by hydrolyzing (de‑acetylating) polyvinyl acetate to form polyvinyl alcohol chains.
- Regulation: Authorised as E1203 in the European Union with purity specifications; in the United States it is permitted for certain food-contact films under federal rules.
- Dietary notes: Synthetic and typically vegan-friendly; used in very small amounts on coated products.

## Why is Polyvinyl alcohol added to food?
Manufacturers add polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) to create a thin, even film that protects surfaces and gives a smooth, glossy finish. This film helps control moisture pickup, reduces dusting, prevents pieces from sticking together, and can slow color or flavor loss during storage.[^1]  
Because it dissolves in water and forms clear films, it is well suited for coating tablets, capsules, and some confectionery items.[^1]

## What foods contain Polyvinyl alcohol?
You are most likely to see E1203 listed on:
- Coated tablets and capsules for foods or food supplements (for example, multivitamin tablets).[^2]
- Some sugar-coated “dragee” style candies where a smooth, shiny surface is desired.[^2]

In the European Union (EU), polyvinyl alcohol is an authorised food additive with its identity and purity specifications set in law, so it can be used only in the food categories and amounts the rules allow.[^1][^2] In the United States, it is permitted for use in certain food-contact films, which may appear as packaging or coating materials that touch food but are not necessarily added to recipes as ingredients.[^3]

## What can replace Polyvinyl alcohol?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- For glossy, protective coatings on candies or tablets: [shellac](/e904-shellac) or [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax).
- For clear, edible films and capsule coatings: [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan), [hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose](/e464-hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose), or [methyl cellulose](/e461-methyl-cellulose).
- For thickening or stabilizing in water-based foods: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [modified starch](/e14xx-modified-starch).

## How is Polyvinyl alcohol made?
Polyvinyl alcohol is produced by hydrolyzing polyvinyl acetate, which removes acetate groups and yields chains of “vinyl alcohol” units. Different grades are made by adjusting the degree of hydrolysis and the polymer chain length, which change film strength, flexibility, and solubility.[^1] It is a synthetic, water-soluble polymer used because it forms clear, strong films that adhere well to many surfaces.[^4]

## Is Polyvinyl alcohol safe to eat?
In the EU, polyvinyl alcohol (E1203) is authorised as a food additive and must meet strict identity and purity specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, including limits on residual starting materials and by-products.[^1] Authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 means it can be used only in approved food categories and at regulated levels, reflecting the EU’s safety evaluation and risk management process.[^2]  
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits poly(vinyl alcohol) films for food-contact applications under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); this rule sets composition and extraction limits to ensure safety when the film contacts food.[^3]

## Does Polyvinyl alcohol have any benefits?
- For consumers: Coatings can make tablets and capsules easier to swallow and less likely to chip or crumble. They also help products resist moisture and sticking during storage and transport.  
- For manufacturers: PVOH films are clear, uniform, and stable, which helps with appearance and dosing uniformity, and can protect sensitive ingredients from humidity.

## Who should avoid Polyvinyl alcohol?
- People who choose to avoid synthetic additives for personal or dietary reasons may prefer products that use natural coatings like [shellac](/e904-shellac) or [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax).  
- Anyone with a history of sensitivity to tablet or capsule coatings should discuss options with a healthcare professional and check labels.  
- If your clinician has advised you to avoid coated tablets or capsules, choose uncoated forms when possible.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Polyvinyl alcohol is the same as wood glue.”  
  Fact: Wood glue is usually polyvinyl acetate (PVAc). PVOH is made from PVAc by hydrolysis and has different properties and approved uses in food contexts.[^1]
- Myth: “It doesn’t dissolve, so it just builds up in the body.”  
  Fact: PVOH is designed to be water-soluble and to form films that disperse in water; approved uses consider how it behaves in the body and in food processing.[^1][^3]
- Myth: “It’s unregulated.”  
  Fact: The EU sets detailed specifications and authorised uses for E1203, and the U.S. FDA regulates PVOH films for food contact with composition and extraction limits.[^1][^3]

## Polyvinyl alcohol in branded foods
On labels in the EU, look for “E1203” or “polyvinyl alcohol” near the ingredients for coated tablets, capsules, or shiny dragee-style candies. In the U.S., you are more likely to encounter it as part of a packaging or coating material rather than as a named ingredient, since FDA rules address it primarily as a food-contact film.[^2][^3]
