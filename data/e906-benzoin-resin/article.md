Benzoin resin (E906) is a natural tree resin used in tiny amounts to give a glossy, protective finish to sweets, or as a natural flavoring. It comes from Styrax species and is regulated for specific uses in different regions.

## At a glance
- What it is: A plant resin from Styrax trees, labeled as E906.
- Main job in food: A glazing agent that adds shine and reduces stickiness on the surface of sweets; also used as a natural flavoring in some markets.
- Where you might see it: Coated confectionery and chewing gum; sometimes listed simply as “benzoin resin” or “E906.”
- Origin: Plant-derived (tree resin), not animal-based.
- Regulatory note: Approved as a food additive in the European Union; permitted as a natural flavoring substance in the United States.

## Why is Benzoin resin added to food?
Food makers use benzoin resin chiefly as a glazing agent. A glaze gives confections a smooth, glossy coat and helps stop pieces from sticking to each other or to the wrapper.[^2] Glazing agents are a recognized functional class in international food standards, defined as substances that produce a thin, protective coating on foods.[^6]  
In the United States, gum benzoin is allowed as a natural flavoring substance, so it may also be used to contribute a mild, balsamic-like aroma in foods.[^3]

## What foods contain Benzoin resin?
You are most likely to find E906 on surface-treated confectionery, such as polished sugar candies and chewing gum, where a thin glaze improves shine and handling.[^4] In the U.S., when present, it would appear in the flavor system rather than as a glazing agent, because benzoin resin is permitted there as a natural flavoring substance.[^3]

## What can replace Benzoin resin?
- Other glazes and polishes used on sweets include [shellac](/e904-shellac), [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), and [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax).
- For some applications, film-forming gums like [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) can help with shine and adhesion, though they behave differently than waxy glazes.

## How is Benzoin resin made?
Benzoin resin is the balsamic resin obtained from the trunk of certain Styrax trees (notably Styrax benzoin and Styrax tonkinensis). It is collected from the tree and then prepared to meet food-grade identity and purity criteria laid down in EU specifications.[^1] Those specifications define what the additive is and set limits that must be met before it can be used in food.[^1]

## Is Benzoin resin safe to eat?
In the European Union, benzoin resin (E906) is a permitted food additive for specific uses and must meet the official purity specifications before use in food.[^2] In the United States, gum benzoin is allowed as a natural flavoring substance when used in line with federal regulations.[^3] These authorizations reflect evaluations by regulators that the additive is safe when used as intended.

## Does Benzoin resin have any benefits?
For manufacturers, the benefit is practical: a very thin glaze boosts shine, reduces stickiness, and helps protect delicate surfaces during packaging and transport.[^6] When used as a natural flavoring (U.S.), it can lend a warm, balsamic note to the flavor profile.[^3]

## Who should avoid Benzoin resin?
Most people do not need to avoid E906 when it is used as intended. If you have been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid specific resins or certain additives, or if you have had reactions to resin-based products in the past, ask your clinician and check ingredient lists.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Benzoin resin is the same as benzene.” Fact: Benzoin resin is a natural plant resin defined in food-additive specifications; it is not benzene (a petroleum-derived solvent).[^1]
- Myth: “It always acts as a wax.” Fact: Benzoin resin is classed as a glazing agent in the EU, but different glazes (waxes, shellac, resins) have different properties, so formulators choose among them based on the product’s needs.[^2]

## Benzoin resin in branded foods
Labels may list it as “benzoin resin,” “gum benzoin,” or “E906.” Because it is mainly a surface treatment, it tends to appear in polished candies, dragées, and chewing gum. Availability and use can vary by country, so you may see it more often in markets where glazing with E906 is common.
