Lactitol (E966) is a sugar alcohol used to sweeten and add bulk to foods with fewer calories than table sugar. It tastes mildly sweet, is heat‑stable, and is common in sugar‑free candies, chocolate, and baked goods. Like other polyols, eating a lot at once can cause gas or a laxative effect.

## At a glance
This section gives a quick overview of what Lactitol does and where you’ll find it.
- What it is: a sugar alcohol made from milk sugar (lactose)
- Main roles: low‑calorie sweetener and bulking agent
- Common foods: sugar‑free chocolate, hard candies, chewing gum, baked goods, and ice creams
- Heat and acid stability: suitable for baking and many processed foods
- Nutrition: counted as a “sugar alcohol” on the Nutrition Facts label; provides fewer calories per gram than sugar
- Tolerance: large amounts may cause bloating or have a laxative effect

## Why is Lactitol added to food?
Lactitol is added to provide sweetness and texture with fewer calories than sucrose (table sugar). It also helps replace the bulk that sugar provides, which is important in candies, baked goods, and chocolate. Because it is stable under heat, it can be used in baking and confectionery without breaking down.

## What foods contain Lactitol?
You’ll mostly see Lactitol in sugar‑free and reduced‑sugar products. Typical examples include:
- Chocolate bars and coatings labeled “no added sugar”
- Hard candies and chewing gum
- Cookies, cakes, and other baked goods
- Frozen desserts and ice creams
- Fillings, coatings, and fondants in confectionery

On ingredient lists in the EU, it may appear as “Lactitol” or “E 966.” In the U.S., it appears as “lactitol,” and total “sugar alcohol” may be listed in the Nutrition Facts panel.

## What can replace Lactitol?
Depending on the recipe, food makers may swap Lactitol for other polyols (sugar alcohols) or pair it with high‑intensity sweeteners.
- Other polyols for bulk and mild sweetness: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [maltitol](/e965-maltitol), [isomalt](/e953-isomalt)
- Bulking fibers: [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose)
- High‑intensity sweeteners for extra sweetness: [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k), [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides), [aspartame](/e951-aspartame)

## How is Lactitol made?
Lactitol is produced by hydrogenating lactose (the natural milk sugar). In this process, hydrogen is added to lactose in the presence of a catalyst, converting it into the sugar alcohol lactitol, which is then purified and crystallized for food use.[^1][^2]

## Is Lactitol safe to eat?
In the European Union, Lactitol is an authorized food additive (E 966) under the food additives regulation, and it has official identity and purity specifications.[^3][^2] In the U.S., sugar alcohols like lactitol are recognized in nutrition labeling rules; they are listed as “sugar alcohol” on the Nutrition Facts panel and, for calorie calculation, generally use a value lower than sugar.[^5]

Like other polyols, Lactitol can cause gastrointestinal discomfort (gas, bloating, or loose stools) if consumed in large amounts at one time. In the EU, foods with more than 10% added polyols must carry the statement “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects.”[^4]

## Does Lactitol have any benefits?
- Fewer calories than sugar: For nutrition labeling in the U.S., sugar alcohols (other than erythritol) are assigned 2.4 kcal per gram, which is lower than sugar’s 4 kcal per gram.[^5]
- Tooth‑friendly properties: The FDA allows a dental health claim for sugar alcohol‑containing foods that meet specific criteria, reflecting that these ingredients do not promote tooth decay the way sugars do.[^6]

## Who should avoid Lactitol?
Some people are more sensitive to sugar alcohols. If you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or you notice bloating, gas, or diarrhea after eating polyols, you may wish to limit Lactitol.[^7] Young children may also be more sensitive. In any case, start with small amounts to assess your tolerance. In the EU, look for the required “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects” warning on products high in polyols.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Lactitol is artificial and unsafe.”  
  Fact: Lactitol is made from lactose and is authorized for use in the EU with established specifications.
- Myth: “Sugar alcohols have zero calories.”  
  Fact: Most polyols, including Lactitol, provide some calories, though less than sugar.
- Myth: “If it’s sugar‑free, you can eat unlimited amounts.”  
  Fact: Large portions of polyols can cause digestive upset.
- Myth: “People with milk allergy can’t have Lactitol.”  
  Fact: Lactitol is a purified carbohydrate, not a milk protein; however, individuals should always check labels and consult their healthcare provider if unsure.

## Lactitol in branded foods
You can spot Lactitol by reading the ingredient list. In the EU it may be shown as “Lactitol” or “E 966.” In the U.S., you’ll typically see “lactitol” listed, and the Nutrition Facts panel may also show “sugar alcohol” under total carbohydrates when present in significant amounts.[^5]
