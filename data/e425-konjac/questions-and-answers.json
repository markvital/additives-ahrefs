      "q": "what is konjac flour",
      "a": "A fine powder milled from the corm of the konjac plant (Amorphophallus konjac), rich in the soluble fiber glucomannan (E425). It swells in water to make very viscous solutions and gels, so it’s used as a thickener, stabiliser, and gelling agent.",

    {
      "q": "what does konjac taste like",
      "a": "Konjac itself is nearly flavorless with a very mild, slightly earthy note; it mostly takes on the taste of seasonings. Its texture is firm and springy or gelatinous, and packaged noodles can have a slight odor from the alkaline soaking solution that rinses away.",
