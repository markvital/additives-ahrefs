Algal carotenes (E160a(iv)) are natural orange pigments taken from microalgae, mainly Dunaliella salina. They are used to give foods a warm yellow to orange color and help keep color consistent from batch to batch. In the U.S. and EU, this color is authorized for use in many foods when used as directed.

## At a glance
- What it is: A blend of carotenoids (plant pigments), rich in beta‑carotene, extracted from algae and carried in edible oils. Carotenoids are fat‑soluble compounds that give many fruits and vegetables their orange and yellow colors.[^1]
- E‑number: E160a(iv) in the EU; in the U.S., covered under the color additive “beta‑carotene” listing.[^3]
- What it does: Colors foods yellow to orange.
- Typical label names: “Algal carotenes,” “E160a(iv),” “beta‑carotene (from algae),” or “color (beta‑carotene).”
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU with specifications for source and composition,[^1] and permitted in the U.S. for coloring foods in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Why is Algal carotenes added to food?
Manufacturers add algal carotenes to restore or enhance a natural yellow‑orange shade that may fade during processing or storage. It also helps make products look uniform and appealing across different batches.[^3]

## What foods contain Algal carotenes?
You may find algal carotenes in products like soft drinks, juices, dairy and plant‑based dairy alternatives, margarine and spreads, confectionery, bakery items, sauces, and soups. In the EU, E160a additives (including algal carotenes) are allowed in many food categories under specific conditions.[^5] In the U.S., beta‑carotene is permitted to color foods generally, following good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## What can replace Algal carotenes?
For a similar yellow to orange hue, common alternatives include:
- [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) for bright yellow
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto) for yellow‑orange
- [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for orange‑red
- [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene), [plant carotenes](/e160aii-plant-carotenes), or beta‑carotene from Blakeslea trispora [E160a(iii)](/e160aiii-beta-carotene-from-blakeslea-trispora)
- [lutein](/e161b-lutein) or [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin) for yellow tones
- [caramel](/e150-caramel) for brown to amber
- Synthetic options like [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) for bright lemon yellow

## How is Algal carotenes made?
- Cultivation: The microalga Dunaliella salina is grown, often in high‑salinity conditions that favor carotenoid production.
- Extraction: The algal biomass is extracted to obtain a carotene‑rich fraction, typically using edible oils or approved food‑grade solvents.
- Standardization: The extract is concentrated and standardized, usually as an oil dispersion, meeting strict purity and composition specifications set in EU law.[^1]

## Is Algal carotenes safe to eat?
Regulators have evaluated beta‑carotene color additives from various sources—including algae. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated beta‑carotene (E160a) and established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg body weight per day for beta‑carotene used as a food additive.[^2] In the U.S., beta‑carotene is listed as a color additive exempt from certification and may be used in foods consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

Large clinical trials found that high‑dose beta‑carotene supplements increased lung cancer risk in smokers and asbestos‑exposed workers; this concern relates to supplements at high doses, not to the much lower amounts used to color foods.[^4]

## Does Algal carotenes have any benefits?
Beta‑carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid, meaning the body can convert some of it into vitamin A.[^4] However, color additives are used in small amounts to tint foods, so they are not intended to be a meaningful source of vitamin A.

## Who should avoid Algal carotenes?
- People who smoke or who were heavily exposed to asbestos are advised to avoid high‑dose beta‑carotene supplements due to increased lung cancer risk seen in trials.[^4] This does not generally apply to the low levels used for coloring foods.
- Anyone told by their clinician to limit provitamin A intake should check labels and discuss suitable choices with their healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E160a is the same.” Fact: E160a has several forms: (i) beta‑carotene, (ii) plant carotenes, (iii) beta‑carotene from Blakeslea trispora, and (iv) algal carotenes, each with its own specification.[^1]
- Myth: “Algal carotenes are synthetic.” Fact: They are derived from algae (commonly Dunaliella salina) and standardized under food‑grade specifications.[^1]
- Myth: “Beta‑carotene color causes cancer.” Fact: The increased risk was seen with high‑dose supplements in specific groups (smokers, asbestos‑exposed), not with typical food‑coloring uses.[^4]
- Myth: “It always changes taste.” Fact: At the low levels used for coloring, algal carotenes are generally not noticeable in flavor.

## Algal carotenes in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E160a(iv),” “algal carotenes,” “beta‑carotene (from algae),” or simply “color (beta‑carotene).” Many brands use carotene colors to keep products looking the same year‑round, especially in drinks, spreads, dairy and plant‑based items, and sweets. If you prefer alternatives, choose products colored with options like [curcumin](/e100-curcumin), [annatto](/e160b-annatto), or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract).
