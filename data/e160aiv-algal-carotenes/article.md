Algal carotenes (E160AIV) are natural orange-yellow colorants from microalgae. They add stable color to foods and are widely used in spreads, dairy, drinks, and snacks.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Algal carotenes; E160AIV; mixed carotenes from algae; beta-carotene (from algae)
- What it does: Color (yellow to orange)
- Common in: Margarine and spreads, cheeses, yogurts, beverages, bakery, confectionery, sauces, and supplements
- Diet flags: Vegan- and vegetarian-friendly; gluten-free; not a major allergen; typically kosher/halal suitable (check brand)

1) Why it’s added to food
- Main point: It provides a warm yellow-to-orange color and helps keep color consistent. It is oil-soluble and remains stable in many recipes.
- Shopping tip: If you want products without added color, check labels for “beta-carotene,” “carotene (color),” “mixed carotenes,” or “algal carotenes.”

2) What foods it’s found in
- Main point: You may see it in margarines/spreads, processed cheeses, yogurts, ice cream, soft drinks, fruit drinks, gummies, and nutrition shakes. It also appears in bakery items, soups, sauces, and plant-based dairy.
- Shopping tip: Look for “beta-carotene” or “carotenes” on the ingredient list. In the EU it may appear as “E160a” or “E160a(iv).”

3) What are its alternatives
- Main point: Other yellow-orange colors can replace it. Options include annatto, turmeric/curcumin, paprika extract, carrot juice concentrate, and safflower extract.
- Shopping tip: If you prefer certain sources, check labels for “colored with annatto,” “turmeric (color),” or “paprika extract.”

4) How algal carotenes are manufactured
- Main point: They are extracted from microalgae such as Dunaliella salina. Producers grow algae in ponds, harvest it, and extract carotenes with food-grade oils or solvents, then purify and standardize the color.
- The result is a dispersion or powder that blends into foods, often in vegetable oil or emulsions.

5) How safe is algal carotenes for consumption?
- Main point: Major food-safety bodies have evaluated carotenes from natural sources, including algal carotenes, for use as food colors. They are permitted when used as intended.
- Key sources:

  - { "source": "EFSA (Re-evaluation of mixed carotenes/beta-carotene — E160a, including algal carotenes)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Considered safe at reported use levels; specifications and labeling requirements apply." }

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Main point: Beta-carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid. As a color, typical food-use levels are small and add little vitamin A.
- In supplements or medical nutrition, beta-carotene may help support vitamin A status, but this should follow professional guidance.

7) When algal carotenes may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Main point: High-dose beta-carotene supplements may raise lung cancer risk in current smokers and asbestos-exposed workers. This concern does not apply to the small amounts used as a food color.
- Shopping tip: If you avoid added colors, choose products without “beta-carotene” or “carotenes” on the label.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- What is E160AIV (algal carotenes)?  
It is a natural color made from microalgae that gives foods a yellow to orange hue. In the U.S., labels usually say “beta-carotene” or “carotenes,” not the E-number.

- Is algal beta-carotene the same as vitamin A?  
No. It is a provitamin A carotenoid that the body can convert to vitamin A, but food-coloring amounts are small.

- Is it vegan and allergen-free?  
Yes, it is algae-derived and not a common allergen. Check carriers (oils/emulsifiers) if you have specific dietary constraints.

- What should I look for on labels?  
Look for “beta-carotene,” “carotene (color),” “mixed carotenes,” or “algal carotenes.” In the EU, it may appear as E160a or E160a(iv).

- Are there safer natural color alternatives?  
Annatto, turmeric/curcumin, and paprika extract are common options. Choose based on the shade you want and any flavor impact.
