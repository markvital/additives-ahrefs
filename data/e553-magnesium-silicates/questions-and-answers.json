      "q": "what is magnesium aluminum silicate",
      "a": "A refined clay mineral of magnesium, aluminum and silicate layers used mainly as a thickener/stabilizer and anti‑caking agent, similar in function to the magnesium silicates covered by E553 (e.g., talc/magnesium silicate).",

      "q": "is magnesium aluminum silicate safe",
      "a": "Yes—when of food/cosmetic grade and used as authorized, it’s considered safe; it is insoluble, minimally absorbed, and specifications require it to be asbestos‑free and low in heavy metals.",

      "q": "does magnesium aluminum silicate cause cancer",
      "a": "There’s no evidence it causes cancer when asbestos‑free and used as intended; cancer concerns mainly involve inhalation of asbestos‑contaminated talc, not food/cosmetic‑grade materials.",

    {
      "q": "is magnesium silicate harmful",
      "a": "Food‑grade magnesium silicate (E553) is generally considered safe at permitted levels and is poorly absorbed; the main risks relate to inhaling fine talc dust or using non‑food‑grade/asbestos‑contaminated material.",
