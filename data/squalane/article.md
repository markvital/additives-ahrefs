Squalane is the stable, hydrogenated form of squaleneâ€”the lipid our skin naturally produces. It delivers immediate softness without leaving a heavy or greasy residue.

## Why it matters
- Reinforces the barrier and locks in moisture without clogging pores.
- Works as a slip-enhancing emollient in serums, creams, and facial oils.
- Plant-derived sources (like sugarcane and olives) offer a sustainable alternative to shark-derived squalene.

## How to use it
- Press a few drops into damp skin as the final step of your routine or mix into moisturizer.
- Layer over humectants like hyaluronic acid to seal in water.
- Use as a buffer when introducing strong actives to minimize dryness.
