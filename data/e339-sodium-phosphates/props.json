  "description": "Sodium phosphate is a generic term for a variety of salts of sodium -Na+- and phosphate -PO43âˆ’-. Phosphate also forms families or condensed anions including di-, tri-, tetra-, and polyphosphates. Most of these salts are known in both anhydrous -water-free- and hydrated forms. The hydrates are more common than the anhydrous forms.",
