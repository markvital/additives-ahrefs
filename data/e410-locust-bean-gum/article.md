Locust bean gum (E410) is a plant-based thickener made from the seeds of the carob tree. It helps foods feel creamy and stable, even when heated, frozen, or stored on the shelf. You’ll see it on labels as locust bean gum or carob gum.

## At a glance
This section gives you the quick essentials.

- What it is: A natural gum (galactomannan) milled from carob seeds.
- What it does: Thickens, stabilizes, and helps keep textures smooth.
- Where it comes from: The endosperm of seeds from the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua).
- Common in: Ice cream, cream cheese, plant-based milks, sauces, and baby foods.
- Also called: Carob bean gum, carob gum, garrofin gum.

## Why is locust bean gum added to food?
Food makers use locust bean gum because a small amount can make liquids thicker and more stable. That means sauces don’t separate, dairy desserts feel creamier, and frozen treats resist ice crystal growth. It’s officially recognized as a thickener and stabilizer in many food standards and regulations.[^2][^3]

## What foods contain locust bean gum?
You’re most likely to find locust bean gum in:
- Frozen desserts like ice cream and sorbet
- Cream cheese, processed cheese, and dairy desserts
- Plant-based milks and yogurts
- Dressings, dips, and sauces
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Bakery fillings and glazes
- Some baby foods and special medical formulas

On labels, look for “locust bean gum,” “carob bean gum,” “carob gum,” or “E410.”

## What can replace locust bean gum?
Depending on the recipe, these additives may play a similar role:
- [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for strong thickening at low doses
- [Guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) for cold-thickening and high viscosity
- [Gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum) for fluid gels and clarity
- [Carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) for dairy stabilization
- [Agar](/e406-agar) for firm gels
- [Pectins](/e440-pectins) for fruit gels and jams
- [Sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate) for heat-stable gels
- [Tara gum](/e417-tara-gum) as a closely related galactomannan
- [Cellulose](/e460-cellulose) or [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch) for body and thickness
- [Sodium carboxymethylcellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose) for stable, smooth viscosity

## How is locust bean gum made?
The gum comes from the carob seed’s endosperm. Manufacturers separate the seeds from carob pods, remove the outer husk and the germ, then mill the endosperm to a fine powder. Further steps like screening, purification with water, and heat treatment help meet food-grade purity and safety specs.[^1][^2]

## Is locust bean gum safe to eat?
Regulators in the EU have evaluated locust bean gum and found no safety concern for the general population at typical use levels.[^1] It is also listed with clear specifications as E410 in EU additive rules, which set identity and purity criteria for food use.[^2] In the body, it is not digested like starch or sugar; instead, gut microbes ferment it, which is consistent with its role as a soluble fiber.[^1]

## Does locust bean gum have any benefits?
In foods, it improves texture, keeps sauces from separating, and helps frozen desserts stay creamy. It contributes a small amount of soluble fiber and has very little taste, so it can add body without changing flavor.

## Who should avoid locust bean gum?
Most people can eat foods containing E410 without issues. Because it is a fermentable fiber, some individuals with very sensitive digestion may notice gas or bloating if they eat a lot at once.[^1] Infants and young children with special medical needs should only consume thickened formulas under medical advice; caregivers should follow product directions and a clinician’s guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Locust” means it comes from insects.  
  Fact: It’s from the carob tree, a legume; no insects involved.
- Myth: All gums are the same.  
  Fact: Gums differ a lot. Locust bean gum thickens and stabilizes, while others form firm gels or work better in cold systems.
- Myth: An E-number means “synthetic.”  
  Fact: E-numbers are just identifiers in EU law. E410 is plant-derived.

## Locust bean gum in branded foods
You’ll often see E410 on labels of ice creams, cream cheeses, plant-based milks, fruit spreads, and shelf-stable sauces. It usually appears near the end of the ingredient list, grouped with other stabilizers and thickeners. If you’re comparing brands, look for “locust bean gum,” “carob gum,” or “E410.”
