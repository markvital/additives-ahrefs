Vegetable carbon (E153) is a deep black food color made by heating plant materials until they turn to nearly pure carbon. It gives foods a charcoal-gray to jet‑black shade and is popular in dark candies, icings, buns, and specialty desserts. Regulations and approved uses vary by country.

## At a glance
- What it is: A black coloring made from plant-based charcoal (food-grade activated carbon)
- What it does: Colors foods from gray to black; stable to heat, light, and a wide pH range
- Where it appears: Licorice, black icings and macarons, decorative bakery items, coatings, and some cheese rinds
- How it’s made: Plant materials are carbonized and “activated” to increase surface area, then milled to a fine powder
- Regulation: Authorized as a food color in the European Union (EU) with purity rules; rules differ elsewhere
- Diet and allergens: Plant-derived; typically considered vegan and gluten-free

## Why is Vegetable carbon added to food?
Manufacturers use vegetable carbon to create a strong, neutral black color that stays stable during baking, cooking, and storage. Unlike browns such as [caramel](/e150-caramel), E153 can deliver a true charcoal or black shade without adding flavor or sweetness.[^1]

## What foods contain Vegetable carbon?
In the EU, vegetable carbon (E153) is authorized in selected food categories such as confectionery, fine bakery wares, edible ices, decorations and coatings, and certain cheeses. Labels may list it as “E153,” “vegetable carbon,” or “activated charcoal (food grade).”[^2]

## What can replace Vegetable carbon?
- Caramels: [plain caramel](/e150a-plain-caramel) or [sulphite ammonia caramel](/e150d-sulphite-ammonia-caramel) give brown to dark brown hues rather than true black.
- Mineral pigments: [iron oxides and iron hydroxides](/e172-iron-oxides-and-iron-hydroxides) can provide gray to black tones in uses where they’re allowed.
- Synthetic black: [Brilliant Black BN](/e151-brilliant-black-bn) is a coal‑tar dye that gives a deep black in regions where it’s permitted.
Choice depends on the shade needed, flavor neutrality, and local regulations.

## How is Vegetable carbon made?
Vegetable materials such as wood, peat, or nut shells are heated in low oxygen to make charcoal, then “activated” with steam or other treatments to create a highly porous carbon. The material is purified, milled into a fine powder, and must meet strict composition and impurity limits set in EU specifications, including controls for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of contaminants formed during high‑temperature processing.[^3]

## Is Vegetable carbon safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed vegetable carbon and found no safety concern at the levels used in foods, taking into account its low absorption from the gut and the EU’s impurity specifications.[^1] In the EU, only products that meet these specifications—such as defined limits for PAHs and certain heavy metals—may be sold as E153.[^3] Always follow local rules on where E153 is allowed and how much can be used.[^2]

## Does Vegetable carbon have any benefits?
E153 is used for appearance, not nutrition. Popular claims that charcoal‑colored foods “detox” the body are not supported by good evidence. Activated charcoal can bind substances in the gut, but in the tiny amounts used for coloring it is not expected to have a meaningful cleansing effect.[^4]

## Who should avoid Vegetable carbon?
- People taking oral medicines: Activated charcoal can reduce the absorption of some drugs if taken at the same time.[^4]
- Those with bowel motility problems: Large intakes of activated charcoal can cause constipation; this is unlikely at coloring levels but is relevant for supplements or medical use.[^4]
If you take essential medications, avoid charcoal‑fortified foods or supplements near dosing unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just soot.” Fact: Food‑grade vegetable carbon is a purified, activated carbon that must meet strict identity and purity specifications when sold as E153.[^3]
- Myth: “Charcoal foods detox your body.” Fact: There’s no solid evidence for detox benefits from charcoal‑colored foods, and charcoal can interfere with medicines.[^4]
- Myth: “It adds a smoky flavor.” Fact: E153 is essentially flavorless at typical use levels and mainly affects appearance.[^1]

## Vegetable carbon in branded foods
You’ll most often see E153 in jet‑black licorice, dark bakery decorations, black burger buns, and showpiece desserts like macarons or ice creams. To spot it on labels, look for “E153,” “vegetable carbon,” or “activated charcoal (food grade).” Availability and permitted uses depend on the market, so products may differ between countries.[^2]
