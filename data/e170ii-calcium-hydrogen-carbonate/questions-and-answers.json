      "q": "how does calcium carbonate neutralize stomach acid",
      "a": "Calcium hydrogen carbonate (E170ii) neutralizes stomach acid via an acid–base reaction: Ca(HCO3)2 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O, raising gastric pH.",

    {
      "q": "when calcium carbonate is added to hydrochloric acid",
      "a": "Calcium hydrogen carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid to effervesce (release CO2) and form calcium chloride and water: Ca(HCO3)2 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + 2 CO2 + 2 H2O.",

    {
      "q": "how does calcium carbonate neutralize acid",
      "a": "Its bicarbonate ions consume H+ to form carbonic acid, which decomposes to CO2 and water, leaving a neutral calcium salt (e.g., CaCl2).",

    {
      "q": "why does calcium carbonate dissolve in acid",
      "a": "Acidic H+ converts carbonate/bicarbonate into CO2 and water, removing carbonate from the solid and driving dissolution; calcium hydrogen carbonate itself is soluble in water.",

    {
      "q": "how does calcium carbonate reduce acid rain",
      "a": "Calcium hydrogen carbonate isn’t used to prevent acid rain, but carbonate/bicarbonate alkalinity neutralizes acidic waters; industrially, limestone or lime (not Ca(HCO3)2) scrubs SO2 from flue gases, reducing acid‑rain precursors.",
