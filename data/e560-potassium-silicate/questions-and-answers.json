      "q": "what is potassium aluminum silicate",
      "a": "Potassium aluminium silicate is a different additive (E555), a naturally occurring aluminosilicate used mainly as an anti‑caking or glazing agent; it is not the same as E560. E560 is potassium silicate (K2SiO3), an inorganic silicate salt.",

      "q": "what is the formula of potassium silicate",
      "a": "The common form is potassium metasilicate, K2SiO3. Commercial potassium silicate is often represented as K2O·nSiO2 (various ratios) and may be hydrated.",

      "q": "canon e560 how to scan",
      "a": "That refers to a Canon printer model and is unrelated to the food additive E560; in food, E560 denotes potassium silicate (K2SiO3), an inorganic silicate salt.",
