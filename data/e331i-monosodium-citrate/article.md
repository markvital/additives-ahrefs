Monosodium citrate (E331i) is a sodium salt of citric acid that helps foods keep a steady, mild acidity. It also binds trace metals that can spoil flavor or color, and it stabilizes proteins in products like processed cheese. It is widely used in drinks, desserts, and many pantry staples.

## At a glance
- What it is: the mono-sodium salt of citric acid (one sodium per citrate molecule)
- What it does: acidity regulator (buffer), metal chelator (sequestrant), stabiliser
- Typical foods: soft drinks, sports drinks, processed cheese, jams and jellies, confectionery, powdered mixes
- Taste/texture: mildly tart and slightly salty; helps products stay smooth and consistent
- Label names: “monosodium citrate,” “sodium dihydrogen citrate,” or “E331i” (EU)

## Why is Monosodium citrate added to food?
Monosodium citrate keeps pH steady so foods don’t swing from too sour to too bland. As a buffer and stabiliser, it supports consistent flavor, texture, and shelf-life. It also acts as a sequestrant, binding calcium, iron, and other trace metals that can trigger off-flavors, discoloration, or haze in drinks and syrups.[^1]

## What foods contain Monosodium citrate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Non-alcoholic drinks (including flavored and sports beverages)
- Processed cheese and cheese analogues
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Confectionery, gel desserts, and powdered drink mixes
- Ready-to-drink coffees/teas and some canned or jarred foods

In the EU, sodium citrates (E331), which include monosodium citrate (E331i), are authorized food additives used across many categories under defined conditions.[^2]

## What can replace Monosodium citrate?
Depending on the job you need done:
- To add tang or adjust pH: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), or [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid)
- To maintain pH with less sodium: [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates) or [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates)
- For buffering in cheese and meats: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or [sodium polyphosphate](/e452i-sodium-polyphosphate)
- For baking pH control: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) paired with an acid like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
Choice depends on taste, sodium limits, solubility, and the food’s processing conditions.

## How is Monosodium citrate made?
Manufacturers neutralize purified [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with a sodium base (often sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate) in controlled amounts to reach the “mono” stage of neutralization. The solution is filtered, concentrated, and crystallized, then dried to meet identity and purity specifications set in the EU for E331 (sodium citrates).[^3]

## Is Monosodium citrate safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated citric acid and sodium citrates (E330–E333) and found no safety concern at the reported uses and levels in food.[^1] As with any sodium-containing ingredient, it adds to total dietary sodium intake; people aiming to limit sodium should check labels and follow public health guidance.[^4]

## Does Monosodium citrate have any benefits?
- Helps foods and drinks keep a steady, pleasant tartness without sharp swings in acidity.
- Protects flavor and color by tying up trace metals that can kick off oxidation.
- Supports smooth texture in products such as processed cheese and some desserts by stabilizing proteins and controlling pH.

These are technological benefits in the food, not health benefits to the body.

## Who should avoid Monosodium citrate?
- People on sodium-restricted diets (for example, due to high blood pressure) may choose lower-sodium alternatives or products that use potassium or calcium salts instead.[^4]
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit sodium should review ingredient lists and Nutrition Facts.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Monosodium citrate is the same as MSG.” Fact: It is not related to [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate); they are different compounds with different roles.
- Myth: “If it has ‘sodium’ in the name, it’s just table salt.” Fact: It isn’t table salt (sodium chloride), but it does contribute some sodium to your diet.
- Myth: “It’s synthetic, so it must be unsafe.” Fact: Its safety as a food additive has been evaluated by regulators, and when used as intended it is considered safe.[^1]

## Monosodium citrate in branded foods
On U.S. labels you’ll typically see “monosodium citrate” or “sodium dihydrogen citrate.” In the EU, it may appear as “E331i.” Look for it in ingredient lists of flavored beverages, processed cheese slices and spreads, jellies and jams, candies, powdered drink mixes, and some ready-to-drink teas and coffees.
