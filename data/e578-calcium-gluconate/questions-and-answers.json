      "q": "what is calcium gluconate used for",
      "a": "In foods (E578) it acts as a sequestrant and calcium source to improve stability and fortify products; medically it’s used to treat hypocalcemia, protect the heart in severe hyperkalemia, counter magnesium toxicity, and manage hydrofluoric acid exposure.",

      "q": "how does calcium gluconate treat hyperkalemia",
      "a": "It doesn’t lower potassium; it stabilizes cardiac cell membranes by increasing extracellular calcium, reducing excitability and the risk of life‑threatening arrhythmias within minutes (effect ~30–60 minutes).",

      "q": "what does calcium gluconate do",
      "a": "As a food additive it binds metal ions to prevent quality loss and supplies calcium; as a medicine it replaces calcium, stabilizes the myocardium in hyperkalemia, and treats hypocalcemia and magnesium toxicity.",

      "q": "what is calcium gluconate the antidote for",
      "a": "It is an antidote for hydrofluoric acid exposure (topical/systemic) and for magnesium toxicity; it may also be used as an adjunct in calcium channel blocker overdose.",

    {
      "q": "how to administer calcium gluconate injection",
      "a": "By healthcare professionals only as slow IV push or infusion (not IM or subcutaneous due to tissue damage); a common adult dose for cardioprotection/hypocalcemia is 10 mL of 10% solution (1 g) over 5–10 minutes with ECG monitoring, repeat as needed. Avoid mixing with bicarbonate or phosphate solutions and monitor for extravasation.",
