Calcium gluconate (E578) is a calcium salt of gluconic acid used in food as a stabilizer and sequestrant, which means it ties up trace metals that can spoil taste, color, and texture. It is also used to add a gentle boost of calcium without changing flavor very much.

## At a glance
- What it is: a calcium salt of gluconic acid with E-number E578; function class: sequestrant and stabilizer.
- What it does: helps protect color and flavor by binding metal ions; can help keep some foods firm; adds calcium.
- Where it’s found: calcium-fortified drinks, plant-based milks, canned fruit and vegetables, pickles, and some confectionery.
- How it’s made: from glucose via fermentation to gluconic acid, then neutralized with a calcium source.
- Diet notes: typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets; appears on labels as “calcium gluconate” or “E578.”
- Regulation: authorized in the EU (E-number system) and allowed in the U.S. under GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) rules.

## Why is calcium gluconate added to food?
Food makers use calcium gluconate mainly as a sequestrant. A sequestrant ties up trace metals such as iron and copper that can cause off-flavors, discoloration, or oxidation. It can also act as a stabilizer and firming agent in some recipes, and as a mild calcium fortifier with little impact on taste.[^1] In the European Union (EU), it is listed as E578 with official purity specifications for its use as a food additive.[^2]

Calcium gluconate belongs to the same “gluconates” family as [gluconic acid](/e574-gluconic-acid), [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), [sodium gluconate](/e576-sodium-gluconate), [potassium gluconate](/e577-potassium-gluconate), and [iron gluconate](/e579-iron-gluconate). These ingredients share similar functions, mainly stabilizing foods and controlling reactions linked to metals.[^1]

## What foods contain calcium gluconate?
You may find calcium gluconate in:
- Calcium-fortified beverages, like juices, sports drinks, and plant-based milks
- Canned fruits and vegetables to help maintain firmness
- Pickles and relishes
- Confectionery, jellies, and dessert gels
- Bakery mixes and instant beverage powders

Label wording usually says “calcium gluconate” or “E578.”

## What can replace calcium gluconate?
Possible substitutes depend on why it is used:
- For firming/mineral addition: [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride), [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate), [calcium carbonate](/e170-calcium-carbonates), or [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates)
- For sequestration or acidity control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate) in applications where permitted

The best choice depends on taste, solubility, label goals, and local rules.

## How is calcium gluconate made?
Manufacturers typically produce gluconic acid from glucose by fermentation (using food-grade microorganisms) or by enzymatic oxidation. They then neutralize the gluconic acid with a calcium source (such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide) to form calcium gluconate, followed by purification and drying steps suitable for food use.[^3]

## Is calcium gluconate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated gluconic acid and its salts, including calcium gluconate (E578), and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and exposure levels in food.[^3] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists calcium gluconate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^4]

As with any nutrient source, total calcium from all foods and supplements should be considered, especially if you use multiple fortified products.

## Does calcium gluconate have any benefits?
As a calcium salt, it can help fortify foods and contribute to overall calcium intake. Adequate calcium supports normal bone and tooth structure when part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.[^5] Because calcium gluconate has a neutral taste and good solubility, it is often chosen for clear drinks and delicate foods.

## Who should avoid calcium gluconate?
Most people can consume foods containing calcium gluconate without issues. However, people who must limit calcium—such as those with hypercalcemia, certain kidney conditions, or those taking medicines that interact with calcium—should monitor total calcium intake from all sources and follow medical advice.[^5] If you have a medical condition or take prescription drugs (for example, certain antibiotics or thyroid medications), ask a healthcare professional about timing and amounts of calcium-containing foods.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as calcium chloride.” Not quite. Both supply calcium, but they behave differently in recipes and taste; calcium gluconate is milder.
- “It’s synthetic and unsafe.” It is made from glucose via well-known food processes and is authorized by major regulators when used as directed.
- “It’s only a medicine.” It is also a standard food additive that helps stabilize products and add calcium.

## calcium gluconate in branded foods
You’ll most often see calcium gluconate in:
- Calcium-fortified juices and juice drinks
- Sports and electrolyte beverages
- Plant-based milks and nutritional shakes
- Canned fruit and vegetable packs, and pickles
- Jellies, gels, and some confectionery

Check the ingredient list for “calcium gluconate” or “E578.” Some brands list several calcium salts together to reach a target mineral level and texture.
