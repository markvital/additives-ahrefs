      "q": "is disodium guanylate bad for you",
      "a": "No—it's an approved flavor enhancer and considered safe at the tiny amounts used in foods. People with gout or high uric acid may wish to limit it because it's a purine nucleotide.",

      "q": "is disodium inosinate and guanylate bad for you",
      "a": "Generally no; the pair (often used as disodium 5'-ribonucleotides) is permitted and considered safe at typical food levels. Those with gout or hyperuricemia may prefer to limit them due to purine content.",

    {
      "q": "what does disodium guanylate do to your body",
      "a": "It enhances umami/savory taste by activating taste receptors. It’s metabolized like other nucleotides and can break down to uric acid, with no known systemic effects at normal food doses.",

      "q": "is disodium guanylate msg",
      "a": "No—it's a different compound (a 5'-nucleotide, E627), though it’s often used together with MSG to intensify umami.",

    {
      "q": "what is disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate",
      "a": "They are nucleotide flavor enhancers (E631 and E627) used together to amplify savory/umami taste, often alongside MSG. The combination is commonly called disodium 5'-ribonucleotides.",
