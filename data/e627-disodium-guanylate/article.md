Disodium guanylate (E627) is a flavor enhancer that boosts savory, umami taste. It is often paired with monosodium glutamate (MSG) and disodium inosinate for a stronger effect at very low use levels.

## At a glance
- E-number: E627; also called sodium guanylate or the disodium salt of 5′-guanylic acid.
- Role: flavor enhancer for umami; used at tiny amounts, commonly with MSG (monosodium glutamate) and IMP (disodium inosinate).
- Typical foods: seasonings, snack foods, soups, sauces, instant noodles, and ready meals.
- Taste note: makes foods taste richer and meatier without adding much salt.

## Why is Disodium guanylate added to food?
It makes savory flavors “pop.” Disodium guanylate amplifies umami taste and works synergistically with glutamates such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) (MSG), so food makers can get a strong savory impact using very small amounts. This synergy with glutamate and with [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate) (IMP) is well documented in safety evaluations of these 5′-ribonucleotide additives.[^1]

## What foods contain Disodium guanylate?
You’ll most often see it in flavor-heavy products: potato chips and other snacks, soup mixes, bouillon and stock cubes, instant noodles, seasoning blends, sauces and gravies, and some processed meats. In the United States, ingredients must be listed by their common or usual name, so look for “disodium guanylate” or “sodium guanylate” on the label.[^3]

## What can replace Disodium guanylate?
- Other enhancers: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), or the combined mix [disodium 5′-ribonucleotides](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide).
- Ingredient alternatives: yeast extract, mushroom powder, tomato concentrates, aged cheeses, and seaweed can add natural umami.
- Recipe tweaks: slow cooking, browning (Maillard reactions), and using stocks can build savory depth without additives.

## How is Disodium guanylate made?
Manufacturers obtain 5′-guanylic acid (GMP) by enzymatically converting natural sources of RNA (commonly from yeast or via fermentation), then neutralize it with sodium to form disodium guanylate. Food-grade specifications, including purity and identity tests, are laid out in EU rules for additives.[^2]

## Is Disodium guanylate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed the safety of 5′-ribonucleotide flavor enhancers such as E627. EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) re‑evaluated disodium guanylate along with related additives and did not identify safety concerns at the reported uses and levels in foods.[^1] Internationally, Codex Alimentarius lists disodium guanylate as a flavor enhancer permitted in many food categories under good manufacturing practice (GMP), meaning only the minimum needed is used.[^4]

## Does Disodium guanylate have any benefits?
- Taste: it brings out a full, savory profile and can make low-flavor foods taste richer.
- Formulation: because it is potent and synergistic with MSG, it can help achieve strong flavor with smaller amounts of added seasonings.
- Nutrition: it does not provide nutritional benefits; its role is taste, not nourishment.

## Who should avoid Disodium guanylate?
- People limiting sodium: while used at low levels, disodium guanylate does contribute some sodium; check labels if you’re on a low‑sodium diet.
- People advised to restrict purines: disodium guanylate is a purine nucleotide and is ultimately metabolized to uric acid. If you have gout or uric acid kidney stones and have been told to limit dietary purines, you may choose to moderate foods with added 5′‑ribonucleotides.[^5] Always follow your clinician’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as MSG.” False. Disodium guanylate is not MSG, though it is often used with it to intensify umami.
- “It’s only in artificial foods.” False. It appears in many everyday items like soups and snacks; some products also use natural umami sources such as yeast extract or mushrooms instead.
- “It causes a strong taste by itself.” Not really. On its own it is less impactful; its well‑known power comes from pairing with glutamates such as MSG.

## Disodium guanylate in branded foods
You’ll typically find it toward the middle or end of ingredient lists because very little is needed. In the U.S., it must be declared by name—“disodium guanylate” or “sodium guanylate.”[^3] Common product categories that use it include snack chips, instant noodles, soup mixes, bouillon, sauce mixes, and some deli or canned meats. If you’re checking for it, scan the ingredient list near other enhancers like [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) or [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate).
