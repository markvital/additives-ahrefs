      "q": "how do i mix sodium bisulphate to use as silver pickle",

      "q": "how much sodium bisulphate do you add to lower ph per 10,000 gallons of pool water",
      "a": "As a rule of thumb, about 12 oz (≈340 g) of 93% sodium bisulfate lowers pH roughly 0.2–0.3 in 10,000 gallons; add with the pump running, then retest before dosing again per your product’s chart.",

      "q": "how much sodium bisulphate in 350 gal spa?",
      "a": "Start with about 1/2–1 teaspoon (≈2–5 g) of 93% sodium bisulfate to lower pH by ~0.2 in 350 gallons, circulate 20–30 minutes, and retest before repeating as needed per the label.",

      "q": "how much sodium bisulphate to add to lower ph in swimming pool water",
      "a": "Typically 10–24 oz of 93% sodium bisulfate per 10,000 gallons lowers pH about 0.2–0.4, but the exact dose depends on current pH, total alkalinity, and product strength—dose in small increments with circulation and retest after 30–60 minutes.",

      "q": "how to make acetic acid from sodium sulphate",
      "a": "You can’t practically make acetic acid from sodium sulfate/sodium bisulfate since they contain no acetate; if you need acetic acid, use vinegar (dilute acetic acid) or purchase acetic acid directly.",
