      "q": "why is sodium ferrocyanide kosher and calcium silicate is not",
      "a": "Ferrocyanides—including calcium ferrocyanide (E538)—are synthetic inorganic salts with no animal-derived inputs, so many certifiers accept them as inherently kosher, while some calcium silicate products may require certification due to potential non-kosher processing aids, carriers, or shared equipment. Policies vary by certifier and manufacturer, so the status reflects production controls rather than an inherent kashrut issue with the chemical itself.",
