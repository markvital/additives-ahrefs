Ponceau 4r (E124) is a bright, cherry‑red synthetic food color from the azo dye family. It gives a strong, clean red tone to drinks, sweets, icings, and other processed foods and is widely used in the EU within strict limits. Rules differ by country: it carries a special label warning in Europe and is not approved for use in foods in the United States.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic red azo dye used as a color additive
- What it does: adds a vivid red to foods and drinks; blends well with yellows to make orange shades
- Common names: E124, Ponceau 4R, Cochineal Red A, CI Food Red 7, Brilliant Scarlet 4R
- Where it’s used: soft drinks, candies, bakery icings and decorations, dessert mixes, and some savory products
- Labeling: listed as “Ponceau 4R” or “E124” on EU ingredient lists; in the EU, products with this color must carry a warning about possible effects on activity and attention in children
- Regulation: permitted with maximum levels in the EU; not approved for use in foods in the U.S.

## Why is Ponceau 4r added to food?
Manufacturers use Ponceau 4r to deliver a stable, consistent red color that stays bright through mixing, heating, storage, and light exposure. It helps foods look appealing and uniform from batch to batch, and it can be blended with yellows such as [sunset yellow](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf) or [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) to produce orange or peach tones.

## What foods contain Ponceau 4r?
You’re most likely to find E124 in:
- Non‑alcoholic beverages (e.g., red soft drinks and syrups)
- Confectionery (chews, gummies, hard candies)
- Bakery icings, glazes, sprinkles, and dessert mixes
- Flavored dairy or plant‑based desserts and chilled sweets
- Some savory items where a red hue is desired (coatings, seasonings)

On labels, look for “Ponceau 4R,” “E124,” or “Cochineal Red A.” In product reformulations, it may be replaced or mixed with other reds such as [allura red](/e129-allura-red), or with natural colors like [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) and [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins).

## What can replace Ponceau 4r?
Alternatives depend on the shade, processing, and label goals:
- Synthetic reds: [allura red](/e129-allura-red) (widely used, especially in the U.S.)
- Natural reds: [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red), [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins), [cochineal](/e120-cochineal) (carmine)
- Orange‑red options: [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene)

Natural colors can be less stable to heat, light, or pH. Formulators often trial blends to match the target shade and performance.

## How is Ponceau 4r made?
Ponceau 4r is produced by standard azo dye chemistry: coupling diazotized aromatic amines with naphthalene‑sulfonic acid derivatives, followed by neutralization to form water‑soluble salts. Its identity and purity (including limits for by‑products, heavy metals, and unreacted intermediates) are defined in EU specifications for food additives.[^1]

## Is Ponceau 4r safe to eat?
Safety depends on dose and use conditions set by regulators. In the European Union, Ponceau 4r is authorized in specified foods with maximum permitted levels, and manufacturers must meet strict purity criteria.[^1] EU law also requires a label statement for foods containing certain azo colors, including E124: “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.”[^2] Some limits for the “Southampton six” azo dyes, including E124, were tightened in later amendments to EU rules.[^4]

In the United States, Ponceau 4r is not approved for use in foods; manufacturers instead rely on other reds (for example, [allura red](/e129-allura-red)).[^3]

## Does Ponceau 4r have any benefits?
Its benefit is visual only: it restores or enhances a red hue so products look consistent and appealing. It does not add nutrition or flavor.

## Who should avoid Ponceau 4r?
- People choosing to avoid azo dyes (for personal, dietary, or behavioral reasons) can check for “E124” or “Ponceau 4R” on labels.
- Caregivers concerned about attention or activity in children may prefer products without the six labeled azo dyes; the EU requires a caution statement when they are present.[^2]
- Anyone with a history of sensitivity to synthetic colors should consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s made from insects.” False. Ponceau 4r is synthetic; the insect‑derived red is [cochineal](/e120-cochineal).
- “It’s the same as Red 40.” False. [Allura red](/e129-allura-red) (Red 40) is a different dye that is commonly used in the U.S.
- “It’s unregulated.” False. In the EU, E124 has detailed purity specs, food‑category limits, and a mandatory label warning for children’s behavior.[^1][^2]

## Ponceau 4r in branded foods
Brand recipes change often, and availability varies by country. In the EU and many other regions, you may find E124 in red soft drinks, fruit‑flavored candies, dessert gels, and decorated baked goods. Check ingredient lists for “Ponceau 4R” or “E124,” especially if you’re avoiding azo dyes.
