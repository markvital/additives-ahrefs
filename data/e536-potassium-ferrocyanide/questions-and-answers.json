      "q": "how to make potassium ferrocyanide",
      "a": "It’s produced industrially from iron salts and cyanide chemistry under tightly controlled conditions; do not attempt to synthesize it yourself, and only food‑grade E536 from reputable suppliers is suitable for food use.",

    {
      "q": "how could one ingest potassium ferrocyanide",
      "a": "You don’t ingest it directly; when permitted, it’s present only in trace amounts as an anticaking agent in table salt (e.g., EU max 20 mg/kg salt), and normal dietary exposure via salt is considered safe.",

      "q": "how many grams of potassium ferrocyanide must be used to prepare 800.0ml of 6.00m solution",
      "a": "A 6.00 M aqueous solution is not practically achievable due to solubility limits; in theory it would require about 2.03 kg of K4[Fe(CN)6]·3H2O for 0.800 L, which far exceeds what will dissolve.",

    {
      "q": "how to dry potassium ferrocyanide",
      "a": "Do not heat it to “dry” it—E536 is typically used as the trihydrate, and heating can decompose it and release toxic gases; for food use, simply store the sealed container in a dry place.",

    {
      "q": "how to make .5m potassium ferrocyanide",
      "a": "Using the common trihydrate, 0.5 M corresponds to about 211 g per liter of solution; this is a laboratory preparation and not a food‑use practice, so it should only be done with appropriate lab controls and PPE.",
