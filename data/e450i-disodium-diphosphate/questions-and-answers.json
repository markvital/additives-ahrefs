      "q": "what did marvin sapp do",
      "a": "This seems unrelated; Disodium diphosphate (E450i), also called sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), is a leavening acid and sequestrant that helps dough rise and prevents discoloration in foods like baked goods and potatoes.",

      "q": "how old is marvin sapp",
      "a": "Age isn’t applicable; E450i is a permitted phosphate additive considered safe within regulatory limits (e.g., EFSA’s group ADI for phosphates is 40 mg/kg body weight per day as phosphorus), though people with kidney disease may need to limit phosphate additives.",
