Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472c) are food emulsifiers that help oil and water mix and stay stable. Made from citric acid, glycerol, and edible fats and oils, they also act as stabilisers and can protect flavors by binding trace metals. You’ll find them in baked goods, spreads, sauces, and some drinks.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier made by attaching citric acid to mono- and diglycerides from edible fats and oils
- What it does: keeps oil and water mixed, stabilises texture, and can help protect flavors
- Where it’s used: breads and cakes, margarine and spreads, non-dairy creamers, sauces, and some beverages
- Label names: E472c, citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, CITREM
- Dietary note: sourced from edible fats and oils (plant or animal origin), plus glycerol and citric acid

## Why is Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers use E472c mainly as an emulsifier (it helps oil and water blend), and as a stabiliser (it helps that blend stay uniform over time). It can also work as a sequestrant, meaning it binds trace metals that may cause off-flavors, and it can support antioxidant effects in fats and oils. These functions improve mouthfeel, reduce separation, and keep products looking and tasting consistent during shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
E472c is permitted in the European Union across many food categories. Typical uses include:
- Bakery: pan breads, rolls, cakes, and fillings
- Fats and spreads: margarines and similar emulsified fat products
- Dairy analogs: non-dairy creamers and whipped toppings
- Drinks and desserts: certain flavored beverages, sauces, and sweet desserts[^3]

## What can replace Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Depending on the recipe and processing, formulators might use:
- Other emulsifiers from the same family: [acetic acid esters](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lactic acid esters](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [tartaric acid esters](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [mono- and diacetyl tartaric acid esters](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters](/e472f-mixed-acetic-and-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).
- Other emulsifier classes: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol esters](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids), or [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate).
- For dough strength and aeration: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate).
- For thickening and suspension (not true emulsification): gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum).

## How is Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
Manufacture starts with edible fats and oils that are turned into mono- and diglycerides by reacting them with glycerol. Those mono- and diglycerides are then partially esterified with citric acid, forming a mixture where some of the free hydroxyl groups are linked to citric acid. The result is a blend of molecules that carry both fat-loving and water-loving parts, which is why they can emulsify oil and water.[^2]

## Is Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated E472c together with related emulsifiers and concluded there was no safety concern for the reported uses and estimated exposures. E472c is broken down by the body into substances it already handles—glycerol, fatty acids, and citric acid—before being used in normal metabolism.[^1]

## Does Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
- Helps keep products uniform by preventing oil separation
- Supports smoother textures and better spreadability in fats and spreads
- Can help protect flavor by binding trace metals that drive oxidation
- May improve the stability of foams and emulsions in certain recipes

## Who should avoid Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
People who strictly avoid animal-derived ingredients should check with the manufacturer. The fatty acids used can come from edible fats and oils of either animal or plant origin, and labels do not always state the source.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just citric acid.” Fact: E472c is a family of esters made from citric acid plus mono- and diglycerides; it behaves very differently from plain [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- Myth: “All emulsifiers are the same.” Fact: Emulsifiers vary widely. E472c is especially good at keeping oil-in-water systems stable; others have different strengths.
- Myth: “It’s always synthetic and harmful.” Fact: Safety evaluations by authorities have found no safety concern at approved uses, and the body breaks it down into familiar nutrients.[^1]
- Myth: “If a product contains E472c, it must be acidic.” Fact: The final food’s acidity depends on the whole recipe, not just this additive.

## Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E472c,” “citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids,” or “CITREM.” You’ll most often see it in sliced breads and rolls, cakes, margarines and spreads, non-dairy creamers, sauces, and some ready-to-drink beverages. If source of fats matters to you (for vegan, vegetarian, halal, or kosher reasons), contact the manufacturer for the origin of the fatty acids used.
