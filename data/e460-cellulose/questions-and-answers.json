      "q": "what is cellulose powder",
      "a": "A purified, plant-derived insoluble fiber (E460) ground into a fine powder, used in foods as a carrier, anti-caking agent, thickener, and stabilizer; it isn’t digested by humans.",

      "q": "what is microcrystalline cellulose",
      "a": "The microcrystalline form of cellulose (E460(i)), made by acid hydrolysis of purified plant cellulose. It’s used in foods as a bulking agent, anti-caking agent, and stabilizer.",

      "q": "what is powdered cellulose",
      "a": "Finely ground purified cellulose (E460(ii)) obtained by mechanically processing plant fibers; it helps prevent caking, adds bulk, and modifies texture in foods.",

      "q": "what is cellulose gum",
      "a": "A water-soluble cellulose derivative, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (E466), used as a thickener and stabilizer; it’s related to but distinct from E460 cellulose.",
