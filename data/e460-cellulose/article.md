Cellulose (E460) is a purified plant fiber used in many foods to improve texture and flow. It helps keep powders free‑flowing, adds bulk without adding sugar or fat, and can support a creamy mouthfeel in low‑fat recipes. It is the same carbohydrate that makes up plant cell walls and passes through the human gut largely unchanged.

## At a glance
- What it is: A purified plant fiber made of glucose units that form strong chains
- What it does: Anti‑caking agent, bulking agent, stabiliser, and thickener
- Where it’s found: Shredded or grated cheese, spice blends, bakery mixes, plant‑based meats, dairy and non‑dairy desserts, tablets and supplements
- Common forms: Powdered cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose
- Regulatory status: Permitted as a food additive in the U.S. and EU; food‑grade purity and composition are specified by law
- Typical label names: Cellulose, powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, E460

## Why is Cellulose added to food?
Cellulose keeps powders and shreds from clumping, so foods pour and sprinkle easily. It also adds bulk and helps stabilize mixtures, giving body and a creamy or firm texture to items like shredded cheese, ice cream, sauces, and plant‑based products. Because it is not digested, it can replace some fat or starch without adding usable calories to the food.

## What foods contain Cellulose?
You can find cellulose in many everyday items:
- Cheese: Anti‑caking in shredded cheese to prevent clumps
- Spices and mixes: Keeps seasonings, drink mixes, and baking mixes free‑flowing
- Bakery and snacks: Adds structure in tortillas, wraps, pastries, and extruded snacks
- Frozen desserts: Helps stabilize texture in ice creams and non‑dairy desserts
- Plant‑based foods: Adds bite and juiciness to meat alternatives
- Nutrition products: Used as a binder or filler in supplements and meal‑replacement bars

## What can replace Cellulose?
Depending on the job it does in a recipe, manufacturers might use:
- Anti‑caking/flow aids: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide)
- Texture and stabilization: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)
- Bulking and humectancy: [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol)
- Alternative cellulose form for creamy textures: [microcrystalline cellulose](/e460i-microcrystalline-cellulose)

## How is Cellulose made?
Food‑grade cellulose is purified from plant sources such as wood pulp or cotton linters. Microcrystalline cellulose is produced by partially hydrolyzing cellulose, then washing and drying it to create small, uniform particles. Powdered cellulose is typically made by mechanically grinding purified cellulose into a fine powder. In the EU, specifications set what the additive must look like, how pure it must be, and limits for contaminants like heavy metals.[^2]

## Is Cellulose safe to eat?
Cellulose is authorized for use as a food additive by major regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union, which also defines strict identity and purity criteria.[^1][^2] Like other dietary fibers, cellulose is not digested by human enzymes and passes largely unchanged through the gastrointestinal tract.[^3] Eating large amounts of fiber in a short time may cause temporary gas or bloating in some people; introducing fiber gradually and drinking water usually helps.

## Does Cellulose have any benefits?
As an insoluble fiber, cellulose adds bulk to foods without adding sugars or fat. In the diet, insoluble fiber helps support regular bowel movements as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.[^3] In recipes, cellulose can improve creaminess, stability, and sliceability, which helps maintain quality during shelf life.

## Who should avoid Cellulose?
- People on a medically prescribed low‑fiber diet (for example, after certain surgeries) should follow their clinician’s advice.
- Anyone who notices digestive discomfort from high‑fiber foods may wish to reduce portion size and increase fiber intake gradually.
- Individuals with swallowing difficulties should avoid inhaling or dry‑scooping fine powders of any kind.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just sawdust.” Fact: Food‑grade cellulose is highly purified plant fiber that must meet strict identity and purity specifications set in EU law.[^2]
- “It’s synthetic.” Fact: Cellulose is a natural carbohydrate from plants; food processing steps purify and size it for safe, consistent use.
- “It adds lots of calories.” Fact: Cellulose is a non‑digestible fiber and contributes negligible usable calories in the human diet.[^3]
- “It’s only in ultra‑processed foods.” Fact: It shows up in both simple items (like shredded cheese) and more complex products to keep them stable and free‑flowing.

## Cellulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “cellulose,” “powdered cellulose,” “microcrystalline cellulose,” or “E460.” You’ll often see it in:
- Shredded cheeses and grated hard cheeses
- Spice blends, dry drink mixes, and baking mixes
- Ice creams, non‑dairy desserts, and yogurt‑style products
- Tortillas, baked goods, and high‑fiber snacks
- Plant‑based burgers, nuggets, and deli slices
- Vitamins and supplements as a tablet binder or filler
