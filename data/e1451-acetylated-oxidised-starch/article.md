Acetylated oxidised starch (E1451) is a modified starch used to thicken, stabilise, and help oil and water mix. In the U.S., it usually appears on labels as “modified food starch,” not by its E-number. If you avoid wheat, check labels for the starch source or a “gluten-free” claim.

At a glance
- Also called/E-number: Acetylated oxidised starch; acetylated oxidized starch (U.S. spelling); E1451
- What it does: Emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener
- Common in: Instant soups and sauces, salad dressings, dairy desserts, fruit fillings, canned or jarred foods, baked goods, gluten-free items, ready-to-drink beverages
- Diet flags: Plant-derived; typically vegan and vegetarian. Often gluten-free, but check for wheat-based sources; look for “gluten-free” if needed. Non-GMO options exist; look for “Non-GMO” labels.

1) Why it’s added to food
- It helps keep sauces smooth, dressings from separating, and fillings stable. It also holds water and improves texture in low-fat or reduced-sugar foods.
- It works at low levels and stays stable when heated, chilled, or frozen and thawed.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You may see it in instant gravies, soups, and pan sauces; spoonable and pourable dressings; yogurt and puddings; pie and fruit fillings; plant-based milks; and processed meats for moisture control.
- U.S. labels usually say “modified food starch.” Imports may list “E1451.” If you need to avoid wheat, check if the starch source is corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat, or choose products labeled “gluten-free.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Other modified starches: oxidized starch (E1404), acetylated distarch adipate (E1422), or simple “modified food starch” from corn, potato, or tapioca.
- Hydrocolloids and gums: xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, or carrageenan.
- Emulsifiers for certain uses: lecithin or mono- and diglycerides.
- Shopping tip: If you want fewer modified starches, look for products thickened with “xanthan gum,” “pectin,” or “cornstarch.”

4) How acetylated oxidised starch is manufactured
- Food starch (often corn, potato, or tapioca) is first oxidized to slightly break down the starch and add new chemical groups. It is then acetylated with food-grade acetic anhydride to add acetyl groups.
- The process is controlled, then the starch is washed, neutralized, and dried. The result is a food-grade powder with reliable thickening and stabilizing power.

5) How safe is acetylated oxidised starch for consumption?
- Major regulators have evaluated modified starches, including E1451, and found them acceptable when used as intended in food.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- There are no direct health benefits from E1451 as a nutrient. It is used for texture and stability, not as a vitamin or mineral.
- Some modified starches are used as pharmaceutical excipients (tablet binders/disintegrants) and as thickeners in medical nutrition for swallowing support. Ask your clinician for product-specific guidance.

7) When acetylated oxidised starch may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Wheat allergy or celiac disease: Modified food starch can be made from wheat. In the U.S., “wheat” must be declared if used. Choose products labeled “gluten-free” or with a known non-wheat source (corn, potato, or tapioca).
- Rare starch intolerance or specific medical diets: Follow your healthcare provider’s advice.
- Infants: Infant formulas and baby foods have their own rules. Use only products intended for infants, and follow label directions.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Modified starch is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are different ingredients with different functions. MSG is a flavor enhancer; modified starch is a texture aid. Source: FDA (fda.gov — URL to be added by editor).
- Myth: “E1451 is a preservative.” Fact: It does not preserve by killing microbes; it thickens, stabilizes, and emulsifies. Source: EFSA modified starches re-evaluation (efsa.europa.eu — URL to be added by editor).
- Myth: “All modified starch contains gluten.” Fact: Many are made from corn, potato, or tapioca and are gluten-free; wheat-based versions must declare “wheat” in the U.S. Source: FDA Food Allergen Labeling (fda.gov — URL to be added by editor).

E1451 in Branded Foods
- You’ll find it in shelf-stable sauces, dressings, soups, dairy desserts, pie fillings, and some gluten-free baked goods. U.S. products usually list “modified food starch,” while some imports may show “E1451.”

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is acetylated oxidised starch the same as “modified food starch”?  
Yes. E1451 is one type of modified food starch. U.S. labels usually use the generic term.
- Is it vegan and gluten-free?  
It is plant-derived and generally vegan. It can be gluten-free if not made from wheat; check for “gluten-free” or the source on the label.
- Does E1451 add sugar or calories?  
It adds very few calories at typical use levels because only small amounts are used. It is not sugar, but it is a carbohydrate.
- Is it safe during pregnancy?  
There is no specific pregnancy warning from major regulators. If you have dietary restrictions, follow your clinician’s advice and read labels.
- How can I avoid it?  
Choose products with simpler thickeners like “cornstarch,” “xanthan gum,” or “pectin,” or buy items labeled “no modified starches.”
