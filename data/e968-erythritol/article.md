Erythritol (E968) is a zero-calorie sweetener and bulking agent used to cut sugar without losing volume or texture. It tastes about 60–70% as sweet as sugar and is better tolerated than most other sugar alcohols.

At a glance
- Also called / E-number: Erythritol, E968, meso-erythritol
- What it does: Sweetens with near-zero calories; adds bulk; helps keep foods moist (humectant)
- Common in: Sugar-free tabletop sweeteners, “keto” baking blends, candies, gums, chocolates, ice creams, flavored drinks, protein bars
- Diet flags: Typically vegan, gluten-free, keto- and low-carb-friendly; tooth-friendly; does not raise blood sugar for most people

1) Why it’s added to food
- Main point: It replaces sugar’s sweetness and bulk with almost no calories. It also helps control texture and moisture in sugar-free or reduced-sugar foods.
- Shopping actions: Look for it when you want lower-calorie or low-sugar products. Choose blends with stevia or monk fruit if you want more sugar-like sweetness.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Main point: You’ll see erythritol in many sugar-free or reduced-sugar products. Common examples are granulated sweeteners, “keto” baking mixes, frostings, chocolates, mints, gums, drinks, and frozen desserts.
- Shopping actions: Check ingredient lists for “erythritol.” On the Nutrition Facts panel, look for “Sugar Alcohol” under Total Carbohydrate when declared.

3) What are its alternatives
- Main point: Other low- or no-calorie sweeteners can stand in for erythritol, depending on taste and recipe needs. Some are high-intensity and need bulking agents.
- Options to consider: Allulose, xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, stevia extracts (steviol glycosides), monk fruit (luo han guo), sucralose, and blends.
- Shopping actions: For 1:1 baking, look for “cup-for-cup” blends. If you avoid sugar alcohols, choose allulose, stevia, or monk fruit blends labeled “no sugar alcohols.”

4) How erythritol is manufactured
- Main point: Most erythritol is made by fermenting sugars with food-grade microbes, then purifying the crystals. The process yields a product chemically identical to erythritol found in some fruits and fermented foods.
- Typical steps: Fermentation of glucose, filtration and charcoal treatment, crystallization, washing, and drying to a high-purity powder or granules.

5) How safe is erythritol for consumption?
- Main point: Major authorities consider erythritol safe when used as intended. It has been evaluated in the U.S., EU, and internationally.

  - { "source": "EFSA Scientific Opinion on Erythritol (efsa.europa.eu)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Concluded no safety concern at typical use levels; ADI ‘not specified’." }
  - { "source": "JECFA/WHO Evaluation of Erythritol", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Assigned ADI ‘not specified,’ indicating low toxicological concern." }
- Shopping actions: If you’re new to sugar alcohols, start with small amounts to check your tolerance.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Main point: Erythritol does not raise blood glucose or insulin in most people and is tooth-friendly. It can help reduce calories and sugar intake when replacing sugar.
- Evidence notes: Dental and metabolic benefits are mainly from replacing sugar, not from erythritol being “nutritive.” Effects vary by product and portion size.

7) When erythritol may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Main point: Large amounts may cause stomach rumbling or loose stools in some people, though erythritol is usually better tolerated than other sugar alcohols. People with known sensitivity to polyols should be cautious.
- Special situations: Children may be more sensitive to sugar alcohols. If you follow a medically restricted diet, ask a healthcare professional about sugar substitutes in general.

Erythritol in Branded Foods
- You’ll find erythritol in name-brand tabletop sweeteners, “keto” baking blends, sugar-free chocolates, gums, mints, and frozen desserts. Many protein bars and flavored beverages also use it to cut sugar.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is erythritol safe? Yes, major authorities (FDA, EFSA, JECFA) consider it safe when used as intended. Start with small amounts to check your tolerance.
- Does erythritol raise blood sugar or insulin? No, it generally does not. It is a sugar alcohol with near-zero calories and a glycemic index around zero.
- Can I bake with erythritol? Yes. Use 1:1 blends or pair with stevia/monk fruit for more sugar-like sweetness; note it can cool the palate and may not brown like sugar.
- Does erythritol cause stomach issues? It can in large amounts, but it’s usually better tolerated than xylitol or maltitol. Reduce portion size or mix with other sweeteners if you notice discomfort.
- Is erythritol the same as xylitol? No. Both are sugar alcohols, but they differ in sweetness, calories, and tolerance. Erythritol has fewer calories and is generally better tolerated.
