Erythritol (E968) is a sugar alcohol used to give foods sugar-like sweetness with almost no calories. It’s common in sugar-free and reduced-sugar products like candies, baked goods, and beverages. Shoppers see it on labels as “erythritol,” and in the EU it may appear as “E 968.”

## At a glance
- **Also called / E-number:** Erythritol; E968; E 968; meso-erythritol; tetrahydroxybutane  
- **What it does:** Low-calorie bulk sweetener (polyol)  
- **Common in:** Sugar-free gum and candies, “keto” sweetener blends, reduced-sugar baked goods and drinks  
- **Diet flags:** Sugar alcohol (polyol); often used in reduced-sugar and sugar-free foods  

## Why is Erythritol added to food?
Erythritol sweetens like sugar but adds very few calories. In the European Union, it’s an authorized food additive listed as the sweetener E 968, which is why you’ll find it broadly used in “sugar-free” and “no added sugar” foods.[^1] If you’re cutting sugar, look for blends that pair erythritol with high‑intensity sweeteners for more sweetness per teaspoon.

## What foods contain Erythritol?
You’ll mostly see erythritol in sugar-free and reduced-sugar products. Common examples include chewing gum, hard candies, chocolate confections, baked goods, frostings, table-top sweeteners, and soft drinks or flavored waters.[^2] Check ingredient lists for “erythritol” and, in the EU, sometimes “E 968.” If you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols, compare brands and serving sizes.

## What can replace Erythritol?
Other polyols like sorbitol (/e420-sorbitol), mannitol (/e421-mannitol), and xylitol (/e967-xylitol) can replace erythritol, but they may add more calories and can affect texture and digestibility differently. Stevia extracts such as steviol glycosides (/e960-steviol-glycosides) add sweetness without bulk, so they’re often blended with a bulking agent for baking. Regular sugar gives the closest taste and browning but increases calories and added sugars.

## How is Erythritol made?
Commercial erythritol is made by fermenting sugars from carbohydrate sources, then purifying and crystallizing the product. Official EU specifications describe erythritol as a defined polyol produced by fermentation, with purity and quality limits set for identity and contaminants.[^3]

## Is Erythritol safe to eat?
Regulators in the EU authorize erythritol (E 968) as a food additive, and it has been evaluated for safety by expert panels.[^5] In U.S. labeling rules, FDA assigns erythritol an energy value of 0.2 calories per gram, which reflects its recognized use in foods.[^4]
- EU specifications and authorization exist for E 968, including identity and purity criteria.[^3]
- EFSA has evaluated erythritol for its proposed uses and found no safety concern at reported use levels.[^5]
- For U.S. Nutrition Facts, erythritol uses a 0.2 kcal/g factor, much lower than sugar.[^4]

## Does Erythritol have any benefits?
Sugar alcohols like erythritol can be used in foods that bear an FDA-authorized dental health claim stating they do not promote tooth decay when used to replace sugar under specified conditions.[^6] This is why you’ll often find erythritol in sugar-free gums and mints.

## Who should avoid Erythritol?
If you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols, you may want to limit large servings. In the EU, foods with more than 10% added polyols must state “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects,” which can help sensitive shoppers navigate products.[^7] Start with small portions and see how you feel.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Erythritol is banned in the EU. Fact: It’s authorized as food additive E 968 with official EU specifications.[^8]
- Myth: Erythritol is “synthetic.” Fact: Food‑grade erythritol is produced by fermenting sugars, then purified and crystallized.[^9]
- Myth: Erythritol raises blood sugar like regular sugar. Fact: Using polyols instead of sugar results in a lower post‑meal blood glucose rise; this health claim is authorized in the EU.[^10]

## Erythritol in Branded Foods
You’ll find erythritol in many “sugar-free” gums, mints, chocolates, cookies, and in tabletop sweetener blends marketed for low‑sugar baking. It also appears in flavored beverages and sports nutrition products.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
**Q:** Is erythritol a sugar alcohol?  
**A:** Yes. It’s a polyol used as a bulk sweetener and is commonly blended with high‑intensity sweeteners in tabletop products.

**Q:** How many calories does erythritol have?  
**A:** FDA’s labeling rules use 0.2 calories per gram for erythritol, much less than sugar’s 4 calories per gram.[^4]

**Q:** Will erythritol spike my blood sugar?  
**A:** When polyols replace sugar in foods or drinks, the blood glucose rise is lower than with sugar, per an EU‑authorized health claim.[^10]

**Q:** Does erythritol cause cavities?  
**A:** FDA allows a health claim for sugar alcohols stating they do not promote dental caries when used to replace sugars under specified conditions.[^6]

**Q:** How is erythritol listed on labels?  
**A:** In the U.S., you’ll see “erythritol” in the ingredient list, and it may be included under “sugar alcohol” on the Nutrition Facts panel. In the EU, it may appear as “E 968.”
