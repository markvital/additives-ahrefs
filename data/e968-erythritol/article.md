Erythritol (E968) is a sugar alcohol used to sweeten foods with little to no energy contribution and to help replace table sugar in “sugar-free” and “no added sugar” products. It’s widely authorized as a sweetener in the EU and is permitted in many U.S. foods via FDA’s GRAS process. It’s often blended with other sweeteners to balance taste and texture.

## At a glance
- **Also called / E-number:** Erythritol; E968; E 968; meso-erythritol; tetrahydroxybutane  
- **What it does:** Sweetener (sugar substitute)  
- **Common in:** Sugar-free gum and mints, candies, baked goods, beverages, tabletop sweeteners  
- **Diet flags:** Sugar alcohol (polyol); very low-energy sweetener (0 kJ/g in the EU)  

## Why is erythritol added to food?
Erythritol is added to sweeten foods and beverages while reducing sugars and calories. In the EU it’s authorized as a food additive with the functional class “sweetener” under the name E 968, which allows its use across many food categories when conditions in the legislation are met.[^1] When shopping, look for “erythritol” in the ingredients of sugar-free or reduced-sugar items. If you’re avoiding sugar alcohols, check labels and choose products without them.

## What foods contain erythritol?
You’ll most often find erythritol in sugar-free and reduced-sugar products. Common categories include chewing gum and mints, candies, baked goods, beverages, and tabletop sweeteners; these uses were evaluated by the EU food safety authority when assessing E 968.[^2] Check labels for “erythritol,” “sugar alcohol,” or “E 968” (the E‑number may appear on EU labels). Avoid it if you know sugar alcohols don’t agree with you.

## What can replace erythritol?
Other sweeteners can replace erythritol, but each has trade-offs. Polyols like [xylitol](/e967-xylitol) and [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) add bulk and some cooling effect but have more calories than erythritol and may cause more digestive upset. High-intensity sweeteners such as [sucralose](/e955-sucralose) or [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides) are far sweeter and used in tiny amounts, but they don’t provide bulk and may change texture or taste.

## How is erythritol made?
Commercial erythritol is typically produced by fermenting sugars (such as glucose) with specific microorganisms, followed by purification and crystallization. It must meet the EU specifications for identity and purity in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which include requirements for composition and contaminant limits.[^3]

## Is erythritol safe to eat?
Regulators consider erythritol safe when used as intended. In the U.S., FDA lists erythritol on its Food Additive Status List based on GRAS notices for use as a sweetener, and in the EU, EFSA concluded there is no safety concern at reported uses and use levels for E 968.[^4][^2]
- In the EU, erythritol is authorized as a sweetener (E 968) under the food additives framework.[^1]
- In U.S. Nutrition Facts, sugar alcohols (including erythritol) are declared under “Total Carbohydrate” when present, per 21 CFR 101.9.[^5]
- EFSA’s safety opinion reviewed intake, metabolism, and tolerance data and found no safety concern at typical use levels.[^2]

## Does erythritol have any benefits?
Erythritol sweetens with negligible energy, and the EU sets its energy conversion factor at 0 kJ/g for labeling.[^7] EFSA also concluded that replacing sugars with sugar replacers (including erythritol) helps maintain tooth mineralization and reduces post‑meal blood glucose responses when they replace sugars in foods and drinks.[^6]

## Who should avoid erythritol?
People who are sensitive to sugar alcohols should moderate intake, since large amounts may cause gastrointestinal discomfort. In the EU, foods with more than 10% added polyols must carry the warning “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects,” which can guide sensitive shoppers.[^7]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Erythritol is a petroleum-derived artificial chemical.” Fact: Food-grade erythritol is produced by fermentation of sugars and then purified and crystallized, per EU specifications.[^3]  
- Myth: “Erythritol spikes blood sugar like regular sugar.” Fact: When erythritol replaces sugars, EFSA found it helps reduce post‑prandial blood glucose responses.[^6]  
- Myth: “Erythritol is banned in the EU or U.S.” Fact: It’s authorized in the EU as E 968 and appears on FDA’s Food Additive Status List through GRAS notices.[^1][^4]

## Erythritol in Branded Foods
You’ll see erythritol in many sugar-free gums and mints, “keto” or reduced-sugar chocolates and baked goods, flavored beverages, and tabletop sweeteners, often blended with high-intensity sweeteners for balanced taste.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
Q: Is erythritol a sugar alcohol?  
A: Yes. It’s a polyol used as a bulk sweetener in many sugar-free foods, and it’s declared as a sugar alcohol on U.S. Nutrition Facts when listed.

Q: How is erythritol labeled on packages?  
A: Look for “erythritol” in the ingredient list. In the EU it may also appear by its E‑number “E 968,” and in the U.S. it contributes to the “sugar alcohol” line under Total Carbohydrate.

Q: Does erythritol have calories?  
A: In the EU, its energy conversion factor is 0 kJ/g for nutrition labeling, so it’s considered noncaloric there. U.S. labels count sugar alcohol grams under carbohydrates, but erythritol contributes negligible energy.

Q: Can erythritol upset your stomach?  
A: Some people may experience digestive discomfort from sugar alcohols, especially with high intakes. EU labels warn that excessive consumption of polyols may have a laxative effect.

Q: Can I bake with erythritol?  
A: Yes, it’s often used in baked goods and sweet treats. Results vary by recipe, and it’s commonly blended with other sweeteners to improve taste and texture.
