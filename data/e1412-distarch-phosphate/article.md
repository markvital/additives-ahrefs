Distarch phosphate (E1412) is a modified starch used to thicken and stabilize many foods. It helps sauces, soups, and desserts keep a smooth texture during heating, mixing, and freezing. It is authorized for use by regulators in both the EU and the U.S. under set conditions.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant starch that has been lightly cross‑linked with phosphate groups to make it more stable.
- What it does: works as a thickener and stabiliser; resists heat, acid, and shear; helps prevent “water‑off” (syneresis) and improves freeze–thaw stability.
- Where it’s used: soups and sauces, pie fillings, dairy desserts, ready meals, canned foods, and some gluten‑free bakery items.
- How it appears on labels: “distarch phosphate,” “modified starch,” or “E1412.”
- Typical sources: starch from corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat.
- Functional class: thickener, stabiliser, emulsifier support.

## Why is Distarch phosphate added to food?
Manufacturers add E1412 to control texture and stability. Cross‑linking keeps starch granules from breaking down so easily, so the food stays thick and smooth even after cooking, stirring, or sitting on the shelf. It also helps stop water from separating out of gels and fillings, and it improves performance after freezing and thawing.

## What foods contain Distarch phosphate?
You may find E1412 in:
- Canned or ambient soups and sauces
- Pie fillings, puddings, custards, and dairy desserts
- Ready meals and gravies
- Processed meats and plant‑based alternatives (for water binding)
- Snack seasonings and coatings
- Some beverages and drinkable yogurts for light body

Product labels may list it as “modified starch,” “distarch phosphate,” or “E1412,” depending on the market.

## What can replace Distarch phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and processing needs:
- Other modified starches such as [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch), [acid-treated modified starch](/e1401-acid-treated-modified-starch), [acetylated distarch phosphate](/e1414-acetylated-distarch-phosphate), [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate), or [acetylated distarch adipate](/e1422-acetylated-distarch-adipate)
- Hydrocolloids and gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [pectins](/e440-pectins)

Each behaves differently, so food makers choose based on heat, pH, shear, and freeze–thaw needs.

## How is Distarch phosphate made?
E1412 is produced by treating edible starch (for example, from corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat) with small amounts of approved phosphate cross‑linking agents to create bridges between starch chains, which increases stability during processing and storage.[^1] In the EU, “distarch phosphate” is the defined name and specification for this phosphate‑cross‑linked starch additive with purity and processing limits set by law.[^2]

## Is Distarch phosphate safe to eat?
In the United States, “food starch‑modified” (which includes distarch phosphate made with specified reagents) is permitted for use in food, provided it meets the conditions and specifications in 21 CFR 172.892.[^1] In the European Union, EFSA re‑evaluated modified starches, including E1412, and concluded there was no safety concern at reported uses and that setting a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not necessary.[^3]

Toxicology data show these starches are digested like native starch: they are broken down by normal digestive enzymes and metabolised as carbohydrates.[^4] At very high intakes, some people may experience soft stools or mild gastrointestinal effects, which EFSA noted were not considered adverse at typical use levels.[^3]

## Does Distarch phosphate have any benefits?
Its benefits are technological, not nutritional. E1412 helps foods stay thick, smooth, and stable through cooking, transport, and storage, and it can reduce waste from texture breakdown. For the body, it behaves like ordinary starch and is used as a source of carbohydrate energy.[^4]

## Who should avoid Distarch phosphate?
- People following a diet that excludes modified starches for medical or personal reasons
- Individuals who have been advised by a healthcare professional to limit specific additives
- Anyone who suspects sensitivity should discuss it with a clinician and check product labels for “distarch phosphate,” “modified starch,” or “E1412”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E‑numbers are always harmful.” Fact: An E‑number means the additive has been evaluated and authorized for use in the EU.
- Myth: “Distarch phosphate is a preservative.” Fact: E1412 is a texture aid (thickener/stabiliser); it does not act as a chemical preservative.
- Myth: “It isn’t digested.” Fact: Modified starches like E1412 are broken down by normal digestive enzymes and used like regular starch.

## Distarch phosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “distarch phosphate,” “modified starch,” or “E1412.” In North America, it may appear as “modified food starch.” The exact products and amounts vary by brand and recipe; it is common in shelf‑stable sauces, ready meals, and dessert mixes.
