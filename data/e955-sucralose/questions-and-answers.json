      "q": "is sucralose bad for you",
      "a": "For most people, no—sucralose (E955) is approved by major regulators and considered safe within the acceptable daily intake (about 5–15 mg/kg body weight/day, depending on the authority). Some studies note possible effects on the gut microbiome or insulin responses and that very high-heat cooking can degrade sucralose, so use it in moderation and as directed.",

    {
      "q": "is sucralose worse than sugar",
      "a": "Not typically; sucralose provides sweetness without calories, blood‑sugar spikes, or tooth‑decay risk, whereas sugar adds calories and raises blood glucose. Research on long‑term metabolic effects of non‑nutritive sweeteners is mixed, so choice depends on your goals and tolerance.",

      "q": "sucralose what is it",
      "a": "Sucralose (E955) is a noncaloric artificial sweetener made by chlorinating sucrose, about 600 times sweeter than sugar. It's heat‑stable and widely used to sweeten beverages, desserts, and packaged foods.",
