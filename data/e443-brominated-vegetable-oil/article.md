Brominated vegetable oil (E443) is a modified vegetable oil once used to keep citrus flavor oils mixed evenly in some soft drinks. In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized a rule revoking its authorization for use in foods because of safety concerns. Consumers can still spot it on labels as “brominated vegetable oil.”

## At a glance
- Role: weighting agent to keep citrus oils from separating in beverages
- Where it was used: some citrus-flavored soft drinks and similar beverages
- U.S. status: FDA has revoked authorization for use in food; manufacturers are reformulating[^1]
- What to look for on labels: “brominated vegetable oil” listed among ingredients[^3]
- Common replacements: [sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate) (E444), [glycerol esters of wood rosin](/e445-glycerol-esters-of-wood-rosin) (E445); stabilizers like [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) (E414) and [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) (E415)

## Why is Brominated vegetable oil added to food?
It was used as a “weighting agent” in citrus-flavored drinks to make the flavoring oils about as dense as the beverage, helping the flavor stay evenly mixed instead of floating to the top.[^2]

## What foods contain Brominated vegetable oil?
Historically, some citrus sodas, fruit-flavored soft drinks, and similar beverages used brominated vegetable oil to keep flavor oils dispersed.[^2] If present, it must appear on the ingredient list by its common name, “brominated vegetable oil.”[^3]

## What can replace Brominated vegetable oil?
Beverage makers often use other weighting agents such as:
- [Sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate) (E444)
- [Glycerol esters of wood rosin](/e445-glycerol-esters-of-wood-rosin) (E445)

Formulators may also add stabilizers and emulsifiers to help keep flavors suspended, including [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) (E414) and [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) (E415). These do not work exactly the same way as brominated vegetable oil but can support beverage stability.

## How is Brominated vegetable oil made?
Brominated vegetable oil is created by reacting a vegetable oil (typically a triglyceride oil) with bromine, a halogen element. This reaction increases the oil’s density so it can act as a weighting agent in citrus-flavored beverages.[^2]

## Is Brominated vegetable oil safe to eat?
The FDA reviewed new toxicology data and concluded that brominated vegetable oil is no longer safe for use in food. The agency issued a final rule revoking its food additive authorization in 2024, citing evidence of health risks from studies, including effects on the thyroid in animals.[^1][^2]

## Does Brominated vegetable oil have any benefits?
There are no nutrition or health benefits for consumers. Its benefit is technological: it helps keep citrus flavor oils evenly mixed in beverages so the drink looks and tastes consistent from first sip to last.[^2]

## Who should avoid Brominated vegetable oil?
In the United States, brominated vegetable oil is no longer an authorized food additive, so consumers should avoid products that list it on the label.[^1] If you have older stocked products or imported items, check the ingredient list.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It adds citrus flavor. Fact: It does not add flavor; it helps keep flavor oils mixed.
- Myth: It is the same as table bromine. Fact: It is a chemically modified oil made using bromine and used for a specific technological purpose.[^2]
- Myth: It is still allowed in U.S. foods. Fact: The FDA has revoked its authorization for use in food.[^1]

## Brominated vegetable oil in branded foods
Companies that once used brominated vegetable oil in citrus drinks have been reformulating in response to regulatory changes. To know what a specific product contains, read the ingredient list; manufacturers must list “brominated vegetable oil” if it is present.[^3]
