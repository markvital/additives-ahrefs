Beetroot red (E162) is a natural red-to-pink food color made from red beets. Its main coloring pigment is betanin, which gives foods a vivid berry-like hue without using synthetic dyes. It is widely used in drinks, dairy, and confections, especially where a “natural color” label is preferred.

## Why is Beetroot red added to food?
Food makers use beetroot red to give products an appealing red or pink color from a plant source. In the European Union (EU), it is an authorized food additive with the designation E162, meaning it has defined uses and purity requirements under EU law.[^2]

## What foods contain Beetroot red?
You’ll most often see E162 in:
- Fruit and soft drinks
- Yogurts, ice creams, and frozen desserts
- Confectionery, gummies, and icing
- Fruit fillings, jams, and dessert sauces
- Some ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, and bakery decorations

On ingredient lists, it may appear as “Beetroot red,” “betanin,” “beet juice (for color),” or “E162.”

## What can replace Beetroot red?
Depending on the target shade and processing conditions, formulators may choose:
- Other natural reds: [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) (berry/grape sources), [cochineal](/e120-cochineal) (carmine), or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for orange‑red tones.
- Synthetic reds where permitted: [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red), [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r), or [erythrosine](/e127-erythrosine).

Note that each color behaves differently in heat, light, and varying acidity, so substitutions are not always 1:1.

## How is Beetroot red made?
Beetroot red is obtained by extracting pigments from red beetroot (Beta vulgaris), typically using water, then clarifying and concentrating the color. Its composition and identity are specified in EU law, which sets quality and purity criteria for the additive placed on the market.[^1]

## Is Beetroot red safe to eat?
In the EU, E162 is authorized for use in foods and must meet specifications and good manufacturing practice. Food additives in the EU are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and are authorized only when they meet safety standards.[^2][^3]

## Does Beetroot red have any benefits?
Beetroot red does not add significant nutrition at the levels used for coloring. Its main benefit is providing a bright, plant-derived red color that can support “no artificial colors” positioning.

## Who should avoid Beetroot red?
- If you have a known sensitivity or allergy to beetroot, check labels for “Beetroot red,” “betanin,” or “E162.”
- If you are following dietary advice that limits certain color additives, speak with your healthcare professional about whether naturally sourced colors like E162 meet your needs.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Beetroot red is the same as beet sugar. Fact: E162 is a color extract; it is not used to sweeten foods.
- Myth: Natural colors never fade. Fact: Natural pigments can be sensitive to processing and storage conditions.
- Myth: All red colors are synthetic. Fact: E162 is made from beets, a plant source.

## Beetroot red in branded foods
On packaged foods, look for “Beetroot red,” “betanin,” “beet juice (for color),” or “E162” in the ingredient list. It is common in pink yogurts and smoothies, fruit chews and gummies, ice creams and frozen novelties, and fruit-based sauces. Some products may blend E162 with acidity regulators like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to fine‑tune hue in the finished recipe.
