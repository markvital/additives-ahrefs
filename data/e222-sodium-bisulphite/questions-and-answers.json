      "q": "is sodium bisulfite bad for you",
      "a": "At approved food-use levels, sodium bisulfite (E222) is considered safe; regulators set a group ADI of 0–0.7 mg/kg body weight expressed as SO2. However, sulfite‑sensitive people—especially some asthmatics—may experience reactions like wheezing, hives, or headaches and should avoid it.",

      "q": "how much sodium bisulfite to neutralize chlorine",
      "a": "Approximately 1.5 mg of sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is needed per 1 mg of free chlorine (as Cl2) per liter, stoichiometrically. In practice use a slight excess and confirm with a chlorine test; the reaction releases heat and SO2, so handle carefully.",

      "q": "is sodium bisulfite gluten free",
