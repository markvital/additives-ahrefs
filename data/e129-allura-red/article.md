Allura red (E129), also called FD&C Red 40, is a bright red food color. It helps products look consistent and appealing. It is approved for use in the U.S. and EU within set limits.

- Also called/E-number: E129; Allura Red AC; FD&C Red 40; Red 40; C.I. 16035; Red 40 Lake
- What it does: Adds red color; water‑soluble dye; “lake” form works in fats and icings
- Common in: Soft drinks, sports drinks, candies, gelatins, cereals, frostings, ice pops, fruit snacks, flavored yogurts, sauces, drink mixes; also some medicines and supplements
- Diet flags: Vegan-friendly; vegetarian; gluten-free; typically kosher/halal; artificial color (avoid if you want “no artificial colors”)

1) Why it’s added to food
- It provides a stable, uniform red color. It replaces color lost in processing and keeps products looking the same batch to batch. The lake form colors fat-based coatings, icings, and candies.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You’ll see it in red or pink drinks, gummies, hard candies, gelatins, bakery mixes, frostings, cereals, fruit snacks, ice pops, and some sauces. It also colors some chewable vitamins, over‑the‑counter meds, and drink mixes. On labels, look for “Red 40,” “FD&C Red 40,” or “Allura Red AC.”
- Shopping tips: Check ingredient lists for “Red 40.” Choose items labeled “no artificial colors” or “colored with vegetable juice” if you want to avoid it.

3) What are its alternatives
- Plant-based reds: beet juice/powder, anthocyanins (grape skin, purple sweet potato), black carrot, elderberry, and paprika/annatto blends.
- Carmine/cochineal (E120) is another red but comes from insects, so it is not vegan.
- Shopping tips: Look for labels that say “colored with fruit/vegetable juice” or name a specific natural color. Pick clear or naturally colored versions of drinks and snacks.

4) How Allura red is manufactured
- It is a synthetic azo dye made from petroleum-derived starting materials. Manufacturers create it by controlled chemical steps (diazotization and coupling), add sulfonate groups for water solubility, and neutralize to the sodium salt. The color is purified; in the U.S., each batch must pass FDA certification. “Red 40 Lake” is made by depositing the dye onto an insoluble mineral base for use in fats and dry coatings.

5) How safe is Allura red for consumption?
- Regulators set strict purity rules and use levels. EFSA and JECFA support an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–7 mg per kg body weight per day. The FDA certifies each batch and allows use as listed in the Code of Federal Regulations.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It has no nutritional or health benefit. In medicines, it may aid product identification by color.

7) When Allura red may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Some people are sensitive to synthetic colors and may experience hives or other reactions. A small subset of children may be sensitive regarding behavior; the EU requires a label warning about possible effects on activity and attention. Avoid if you or your child have a confirmed color additive sensitivity, or if your clinician advised an elimination diet.

Myths & facts
- “Red 40 is banned in Europe.” Fact: It is allowed in the EU with an ADI and a warning statement for certain foods. { "source": "EFSA (europa.eu)", "url": "URL to be added by editor" }
- “Red 40 is made from crushed bugs.” Fact: That is carmine/cochineal (E120); Red 40 is synthetic. { "source": "FDA — Color additives overview (fda.gov)", "url": "URL to be added by editor" }
- “Red 40 always causes hyperactivity.” Fact: Evidence is mixed; a small subset may be sensitive, but it does not affect all children. { "source": "FDA Food Advisory Committee background on color additives and hyperactivity (fda.gov)", "url": "URL to be added by editor" }

Allura red in Branded Foods
- You’ll find it in many mainstream sodas, sports and energy drinks, candies, gelatins, fruit snacks, cereals, frostings, and powdered drink mixes. Many private‑label and national brands use it; some brands offer “no artificial colors” lines as alternatives.
