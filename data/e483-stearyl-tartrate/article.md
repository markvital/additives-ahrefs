Stearyl tartrate (E483) is an emulsifier used in small amounts to help fat and water mix and to keep baked goods soft and even. It is authorized in the European Union (EU) and is most often found in bread and other bakery products. It may appear on labels as stearyl tartrate or simply E483.

## At a glance

- What it is: A mixture of tartaric acid esters with long‑chain fatty alcohols; used as an emulsifier and dough conditioner
- Where you’ll see it: Mostly in bread, rolls, and other bakery items in some EU markets
- What it does: Helps dough handle better, improves volume and crumb, and keeps texture uniform
- Label names: “Stearyl tartrate” or “E483”
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU with detailed purity specifications and restricted uses
- Typical alternatives: [Mono‑ and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), and stearoyl‑lactylates such as [E481](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) and [E482](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)

## Why is stearyl tartrate added to food?

Food makers add stearyl tartrate to help oil and water stay mixed and to make dough easier to work with. In baked goods, it can improve loaf volume and give a finer, more even crumb. In the EU, it is an authorized emulsifier, which means it can be used only in specific foods and under set conditions.[^2]

## What foods contain stearyl tartrate?

You are most likely to find E483 in bread, rolls, and other fine bakery wares. In the EU, permitted uses are listed in the Union list of food additives (Annex II to the food additives regulation), which organizes additives by food category and sets any limits that apply.[^2] Outside the EU, use can differ by country.

## What can replace stearyl tartrate?

Several common ingredients can serve similar roles:

- [Mono‑ and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) for general emulsification in doughs and batters
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) for gentle emulsification in bakery and confectionery
- Stearoyl‑lactylates such as [sodium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) and [calcium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) for dough strengthening
- Enzymes like [alpha‑amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase) to improve bread volume and softness without adding emulsifiers
- Oxidizing improvers such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) where allowed

The best substitute depends on the recipe and the desired texture.

## How is stearyl tartrate made?

Stearyl tartrate is produced by reacting tartaric acid with long‑chain fatty alcohols (mainly stearyl and palmityl alcohols) obtained from edible fats and oils. The result is a mixture of tartaric acid esters that meets specific identity and purity criteria set by EU law.[^1] Tartaric acid is a natural acid also used as the additive [E334](/e334-l-tartaric-acid).

## Is stearyl tartrate safe to eat?

In the EU, food additives are authorized only if they do not present a safety concern at the proposed levels, there is a technological need, and their use does not mislead consumers.[^3] Stearyl tartrate has detailed EU purity specifications that limit impurities and define how the additive must be made and tested.[^1] As with all additives, it may be used only in the food categories and amounts laid down in the Union list.[^2]

## Does stearyl tartrate have any benefits?

For food quality, yes. It helps bakers get consistent dough handling, better loaf volume, and a uniform crumb. It can also reduce “oiling off” and help keep textures stable during shelf life. These are processing and quality benefits rather than health benefits.

## Who should avoid stearyl tartrate?

There is no specific group that generally needs to avoid E483 under normal dietary patterns. People who prefer to limit emulsifiers for personal reasons can check labels. If you have been advised to avoid tartaric‑acid‑based ingredients, speak with a healthcare professional and read ingredient lists carefully.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “All emulsifiers are synthetic and unsafe.”  
  Fact: Emulsifiers, including E483, are regulated in the EU and can be used only after a safety assessment and for clear technological needs.[^3]

- Myth: “You can’t tell when this additive is in your food.”  
  Fact: In the EU, additives must appear in the ingredient list by class name (such as “emulsifier”) followed by the specific name or E‑number, for example “emulsifier: stearyl tartrate (E483).”[^4]

## Stearyl tartrate in branded foods

On ingredient lists, look for “emulsifier: stearyl tartrate” or “emulsifier: E483.” EU rules allow either the name or the E‑number, so both forms are common on packaging.[^4] Because its use is specialized, E483 tends to appear in some European bakery breads, rolls, and crackers rather than across many product types.[^2]
