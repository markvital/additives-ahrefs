Spermaceti (E909) is a wax from the head oil of the sperm whale. It was once used to give candies and pills a smooth, glossy finish, but today it has been largely replaced by plant, insect, or mineral waxes because whale products are protected and alternatives work well.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural wax from the sperm whale’s head oil; largely made of wax esters such as cetyl palmitate.
- What it does: Works as a glazing and anti-sticking agent that gives shine and a moisture barrier.
- Where it’s used: Rare in modern foods; commonly replaced by other approved glazing agents.
- Dietary notes: Animal-derived; not suitable for vegetarians or vegans.
- Regulatory status: Not on the current EU list of authorized food additives, and sperm whale products are protected in both the EU and the United States.

## Why is Spermaceti added to food?
Food makers historically used spermaceti to polish confectionery and tablets, reduce stickiness, and form a thin moisture barrier that helps keep surfaces smooth. Chemically, it is a mixture of wax esters (notably cetyl palmitate), which melt at warm temperatures and solidify into a glossy film on cooling.[^1]

## What foods contain Spermaceti?
Modern foods seldom list E909. In the European Union, spermaceti is not included in the EU’s list of authorized food additives, so it is not permitted for use as a food additive there.[^2] In the United States, sperm whales and their parts are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, which effectively prevents sourcing spermaceti for commercial use, including food.[^3] The EU also implements CITES (the wildlife trade convention), which restricts trade in sperm whale products.[^4] Historically, spermaceti was used to shine candies and coat pills, but those roles are now handled by other waxes.

## What can replace Spermaceti?
Several approved glazing and anti-sticking agents provide the same shine and protection:
- [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax)
- [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax)
- [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax)
- [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil), [petroleum jelly](/e905b-petroleum-jelly), [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax), [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax)
- [montanic acid esters](/e912-montanic-acid-esters)
- [oxidised polyethylene wax](/e914-oxidised-polyethylene-wax)

These are widely used to polish confectionery and fruits, and to coat tablets and supplements.

## How is Spermaceti made?
Traditionally, spermaceti was obtained by chilling and filtering the oil from the sperm whale’s head (“spermaceti organ”) to crystallize the wax, then pressing and refining it. The wax consists mostly of long‑chain wax esters such as cetyl palmitate.[^1] Because sperm whales are protected, commercial food uses shifted long ago to non-whale waxes.

## Is Spermaceti safe to eat?
There is no current EU authorization for E909 as a food additive, so there is no EU specification or permitted use levels for food.[^2] In practice, consumers are unlikely to encounter spermaceti in foods in regions where whale products are protected by law.[^3][^4] Safety discussions today focus less on toxicology and more on legal and ethical sourcing, given whale conservation rules.

## Does Spermaceti have any benefits?
As a glazing agent, spermaceti can create a smooth, glossy surface and help slow moisture loss. These benefits are now achieved with approved alternatives such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), and [shellac](/e904-shellac).

## Who should avoid Spermaceti?
- Vegetarians and vegans, since it is animal‑derived.
- Consumers who avoid whale‑derived ingredients for ethical or environmental reasons.
- Shoppers in regions where whale products are restricted or banned; in those places, you should not find E909 in foods due to legal protections.[^3][^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Spermaceti is “sperm.” Fact: It is a waxy material from the sperm whale’s head oil, not a reproductive product.
- Myth: It’s still common in candy. Fact: Modern candies use other glazing agents, especially plant, insect, or mineral waxes.
- Myth: Spermaceti is plant‑based. Fact: It is animal‑derived; plant-based substitutes are different materials.
- Myth: It’s legal to trade anywhere. Fact: Whale products are strictly protected in the U.S. and the EU, which limits sourcing and trade.[^3][^4]

## Spermaceti in branded foods
If you read labels today, you’re far more likely to see approved glazing agents such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), or [shellac](/e904-shellac). If a product lists spermaceti or E909, that would be highly unusual and may not comply with regulations in many regions.
