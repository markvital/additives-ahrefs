      "q": "can you use coconut oil with silicone toys",
      "a": "Coconut oil isn’t the same as silicone oil (dimethylpolysiloxane/E900a); silicone oils can swell or degrade silicone toys, whereas plant oils like coconut oil usually don’t react the same way but are messy to clean and not condom‑safe—follow the toy maker’s guidance.",

      "q": "is coconut oil safe for silicone toys",
      "a": "Manufacturers typically warn against silicone oils (like dimethicone/E900a) with silicone toys; coconut oil may be less likely to affect the silicone itself but can be hard to sanitize and is incompatible with latex condoms—check the product’s instructions.",

      "q": "is silicone oil toxic",
      "a": "Silicone oil (dimethylpolysiloxane, E900a) is considered inert and of low toxicity; major regulators allow it as a food antifoaming agent at very low levels.",

      "q": "is dimethylpolysiloxane bad for you",
      "a": "At approved food-use levels, it’s regarded as safe and minimally absorbed by the body, with no evidence of harm at those levels from major regulators.",

      "q": "is dimethicone bad for skin",
      "a": "Dimethicone is an inert silicone used as a skin protectant and moisturizer and is generally non‑irritating and suitable for sensitive skin. Very occlusive formulas may feel heavy and can aggravate breakouts in a small minority.",

      "q": "is dimethicone bad for hair",
      "a": "Not typically; it coats hair to reduce friction, frizz, and tangles, but can build up with frequent use and weigh down fine hair, so an occasional clarifying wash can help.",

      "q": "does dimethicone clog pores",
      "a": "It's considered non‑comedogenic and unlikely to clog pores on its own, but as a film‑former it can trap sweat or other comedogenic ingredients on the skin in some individuals.",
