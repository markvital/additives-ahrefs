Sodium sulphates (E514) is the EU group name for two related salts: sodium sulphate and sodium hydrogen sulphate (also called sodium bisulphate). They are mainly used in foods to adjust acidity (pH), helping recipes behave consistently during processing and storage. Their names are often written with the U.S. spelling “sulfate.”

## At a glance
Sodium sulphates play a quiet, behind-the-scenes role in food processing rather than home cooking.

- What it is: A group covering sodium sulphate and sodium hydrogen sulphate (sodium bisulphate).
- What it does: Controls acidity (pH) so foods taste and perform as intended during processing.
- Where it appears: Allowed in specific food categories under EU rules; check labels for “E514,” “sodium sulphate,” or “sodium hydrogen sulphate.”
- Safety: Approved for use in the EU with purity criteria; very high sulfate intake from any source (for example, water) can cause temporary digestive upset.

## Why is Sodium sulphates added to food?
Food makers add sodium sulphates to manage acidity, which influences taste, texture, color, and how other ingredients work. In practice, sodium hydrogen sulphate (the acidic member of the pair) is the more common choice when a stronger pH-lowering effect is needed.[^3]

In the European Union (EU), E514 is authorised as a food additive and appears in the EU Food Additives Database under the “acidity regulators” functional class.[^3] The substances also have defined identity and purity specifications set in EU legislation.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium sulphates?
Use depends on the product type and the rules of the country where it is sold. In the EU, E514 is permitted only in certain foods and under specific conditions listed in the Union rules on food additives; always check the ingredient list for “E514,” “sodium sulphate,” or “sodium hydrogen sulphate (bisulphate).”[^2][^3]

## What can replace Sodium sulphates?
If an acidity regulator is needed, manufacturers may choose other acids or their salts depending on flavor and processing goals. Common alternatives include:
- [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid)
- [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates)

The right choice depends on pH target, taste impact, interaction with minerals, and labeling preferences.

## How is Sodium sulphates made?
Sodium sulphate and sodium hydrogen sulphate are produced by neutralising sulphuric acid with suitable sodium bases. In simple terms:
- Sodium sulphate is obtained by complete neutralisation (for example, with sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate).
- Sodium hydrogen sulphate (bisulphate) is obtained by partial neutralisation, leaving the product acidic. 
These manufacturing routes, along with identity and purity criteria, are described in EU additive specifications.[^1]

## Is Sodium sulphates safe to eat?
Within the EU, E514 is permitted in specific foods and must meet strict purity criteria, which means its safety has been evaluated for those uses.[^2][^1] Separately from food additives, health authorities note that high sulfate intake from any source (for example, very sulfate‑rich drinking water) can cause temporary diarrhea; infants may be more sensitive to this effect.[^4] In normal food uses, exposures are far below such levels.

## Does Sodium sulphates have any benefits?
There are no direct nutritional benefits. The value is technical: controlling pH helps stabilize flavor, color, and texture, and can improve how other ingredients (like gelling agents or leavening systems) perform during processing.

## Who should avoid Sodium sulphates?
Most people don’t need to avoid E514 when it appears in small, regulated amounts in foods. However:
- Infants and people who are sensitive to sudden increases in dietary sulfate may experience digestive upset if overall sulfate intake is very high (for example, from sulfate‑rich water).[^4]
- If you are on a clinician‑directed low‑sodium diet, consider total sodium from all sources when reading labels.

If you have a specific medical condition, ask your healthcare professional about ingredient choices.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium sulphates are the same as “sulphites.” Fact: They are different chemical groups; sulphites are preservatives, while sulphates like E514 are used mainly to regulate acidity.
- Myth: E514 “bleaches” foods. Fact: Its role is pH control, not bleaching.
- Myth: Any ingredient with “sulph-” causes allergies. Fact: True sulphite sensitivity is distinct; sulphates are not the same as sulphites and do not have the same allergen profile.

## Sodium sulphates in branded foods
On labels you may see “E514,” “sodium sulphate,” “sodium sulfate,” “sodium hydrogen sulphate,” or “sodium bisulphate.” Appearance in products varies by recipe and local regulations; manufacturers use it when precise pH control is important for quality or processing. If you prefer to avoid it, scan the ingredient list—EU rules require it to be declared.
