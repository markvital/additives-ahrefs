Sodium lactate (E325) is the sodium salt of lactic acid. It helps foods stay moist, keeps acidity in balance, and can support freshness in products like deli meats and sauces. It has a mild, slightly salty taste and is widely approved by regulators.

## At a glance
- What it does: humectant (keeps moisture), pH control agent, flavor enhancer, and sometimes used for shelf‑life in meats.
- Where it’s used: cured and cooked meats, seafood brines, sauces and dressings, tortillas, baked goods, and some beverages.
- What it’s made from: neutralizing [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) with a sodium base such as [sodium hydroxide](/e524-sodium-hydroxide) or [sodium carbonate](/e500i-sodium-carbonate).
- Safety: Affirmed “GRAS” (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the U.S. FDA and re‑evaluated as safe by EFSA for the general population at reported uses.[^1][^3]

## Why is sodium lactate added to food?
Food makers add sodium lactate to hold moisture (so foods stay juicy), to adjust acidity for better taste and stability, and to enhance flavor gently. In meat and poultry, it is also used as a “safe and suitable” ingredient to help maintain product quality and shelf life.[^2] As a direct food substance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium lactate for use as a flavor enhancer/agent, humectant, and pH control agent under current good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## What foods contain sodium lactate?
You’ll most often see sodium lactate in:
- Cured and cooked meats (ham, turkey, roast beef, hot dogs, and sausages)[^2]
- Seafood brines and smoked fish
- Sauces, gravies, and dressings
- Tortillas and flatbreads
- Baked goods and dessert sauces
- Some drinks (electrolyte or sports‑style beverages)

On labels, it may appear as “sodium lactate” or “E325” (in the EU).

## What can replace sodium lactate?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- Moisture retention and texture: [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate) (lower sodium), [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), or pectin (when gelling is needed).
- pH control and tartness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid).
- Shelf‑life support in sauces or drinks: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), depending on the food and regulations.
- Flavor enhancement: [sodium diacetate](/e262ii-sodium-diacetate) in some savory items.

## How is sodium lactate made?
Sodium lactate is produced by neutralizing lactic acid with a permitted sodium base such as [sodium hydroxide](/e524-sodium-hydroxide) or [sodium carbonate](/e500i-sodium-carbonate).[^1] In practice, the lactic acid itself is typically made by fermenting sugars with lactic acid bacteria, and the finished E325 must meet purity specifications set in the EU’s additives regulation.[^4]

## Is sodium lactate safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, sodium lactate is affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) when used in line with current good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated lactic acid and lactates and found no safety concern for their reported uses in the general population.[^3]

## Does sodium lactate have any benefits?
- Helps foods stay moist and juicy (humectant function).[^1]
- Supports flavor and balances tartness by controlling acidity (pH control).[^1]
- In meat and poultry, it is a “safe and suitable” ingredient that can support product stability and shelf life when used as permitted.[^2]

## Who should avoid sodium lactate?
- People on sodium‑restricted diets should watch total sodium from all sources, including sodium lactate, to stay within recommended limits (generally less than 2,300 mg sodium per day for most adults, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).[^5]
- For very young infants, EFSA highlighted concerns with D‑lactate exposure and recommended that only the L(+) form be used in foods for infants and young children; use in foods for infants below about 16 weeks of age was assessed separately.[^3] This is mainly a consideration for specialized infant foods rather than everyday family foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium lactate contains lactose and isn’t dairy‑free.
  Fact: Sodium lactate is the sodium salt of lactic acid and does not contain lactose; it’s typically made by fermenting sugars, not by using milk.
- Myth: It’s just “salt,” so it tastes very salty.
  Fact: It contributes some saltiness but is milder than table salt; its main roles are moisture retention and pH control.
- Myth: “Lactic” means it always comes from milk.
  Fact: “Lactic” refers to the acid produced by fermentation; commercial lactic acid is usually made from fermented sugars.

## sodium lactate in branded foods
You may find E325 on labels for:
- Deli meats and hot dogs
- Smoked salmon and seafood brines
- Bottled sauces, gravies, and dressings
- Tortillas and flatbreads
- Baked goods and dessert toppings
- Electrolyte and sports‑style drinks

Look for “sodium lactate” or “E325” in the ingredient list.
