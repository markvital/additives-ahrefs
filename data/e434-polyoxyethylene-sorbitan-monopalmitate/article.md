Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate (E434), better known as polysorbate 40, is an emulsifier that helps oil and water mix. It keeps sauces smooth, frozen desserts creamy, and drinks evenly blended. You’ll find it in small amounts across many processed foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made from sorbitol, palmitic acid (a fatty acid), and ethylene oxide; commonly called polysorbate 40.
- What it does: Helps oil and water stay mixed, stabilizes foams, and improves texture and shelf life.
- Where it’s used: Ice cream and frozen desserts, whipped toppings, coffee creamers, cakes and icings, sauces, and some beverages.
- Label names: “Polysorbate 40,” “E434,” or “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate.”
- Dietary notes: Non-flavor, non-sweetener ingredient; used in very small amounts for texture.

## Why is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate added to food?
Manufacturers use polysorbate 40 mainly as an emulsifier. It lowers the surface tension between oil and water, so mixtures don’t separate during processing, shipping, or storage. It can also stabilize foams (like whipped toppings), help trap air in frozen desserts for a smoother feel, and keep flavors and colors evenly dispersed.

## What foods contain Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate?
You may see E434 on ingredient lists for:
- Frozen desserts and ice cream, including novelty bars and soft-serve mixes
- Whipped toppings, coffee creamers, and ready-to-drink beverages
- Cakes, muffins, and icings
- Sauces, dressings, and flavored emulsions
- Some confectionery and dessert gels

Because it works well with both fats and water, it appears across many shelf-stable and refrigerated foods that need a uniform, smooth texture.

## What can replace Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate?
Suitable alternatives depend on the recipe and processing method. Common stand-ins include:
- Other emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), and [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Texture agents that help stabilize water–oil systems: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate)
- Specialized emulsifiers for chocolate and fillings: [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate)

Formulators usually test a few options to match the original mouthfeel and stability.

## How is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate made?
Polysorbate 40 is produced in steps. First, sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) is dehydrated to “sorbitan,” then esterified with palmitic acid to form sorbitan monopalmitate. Finally, ethylene oxide is added (“ethoxylation”) to attach about 20 oxyethylene units, creating polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, a blend of closely related molecules.[^1] Manufacturers also control residual processing substances (such as ethylene oxide and 1,4‑dioxane) to meet strict purity limits set by safety assessments and regulations.[^2]

## Is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed polysorbates as a group. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for E432–E436 (including E434), based on available animal studies and the low concern for genotoxicity. EFSA also highlighted impurity controls (for example, limiting residual ethylene oxide and 1,4‑dioxane) as part of product specifications.[^2] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists polysorbate 40 as a regulated food additive with specific use limits in certain foods.[^3]

- ADI means the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.
- EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority. FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

## Does Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate have any benefits?
In food, the “benefits” are technological. Small amounts of E434 can:
- Keep sauces and beverages from separating
- Improve creaminess and air incorporation in frozen desserts
- Stabilize whipped textures and foams
- Help flavors and colors disperse evenly

These effects support consistent texture, appearance, and shelf stability.

## Who should avoid Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate?
- People with a known sensitivity to polysorbates should avoid it and check labels for “polysorbate 40” or “E434.”
- If you are following medical or dietary advice to limit food additives, choose fewer ultra‑processed foods and check ingredient lists.
- For infants and young children, caregivers who wish to limit additive intake can favor simpler recipes and minimally processed foods.

If you have questions about your personal tolerance, speak with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Polysorbate 40 and polysorbate 80 are identical. Fact: Both are polysorbates but have different fatty acid parts (palmitate vs. oleate), which can change how they behave in recipes.
- Myth: E-numbers mean “unsafe chemicals.” Fact: E-numbers are EU codes for approved additives; they pass safety evaluations and have purity standards.
- Myth: Polysorbates are antifreeze. Fact: They are food emulsifiers. “Antifreeze” products use different chemicals for entirely different purposes.
- Myth: You can’t avoid it. Fact: Many products don’t use polysorbates; look for alternatives that use [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or gums.

## Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate in branded foods
On labels, look for “polysorbate 40,” “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate,” or “E434.” Ingredient lists often group it with other emulsifiers and stabilizers. You’re most likely to see it in frozen desserts, whipped toppings, creamers, sauces, and some baked goods. If you prefer to avoid it, choose products that rely on alternatives like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), or [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).
