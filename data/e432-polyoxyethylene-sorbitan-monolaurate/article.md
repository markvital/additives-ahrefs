Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (E432) is a food emulsifier better known as polysorbate 20 or Tween 20. It helps oil and water mix, keeping flavors, colors, and textures stable in foods and drinks. It is widely used in beverages, sauces, and confectionery.

## At a glance
- Also called polysorbate 20, Tween 20, Alkest TW 20, or PEG(20) sorbitan monolaurate
- Role: emulsifier and stabiliser that helps oil and water stay mixed
- Common in: clear flavored drinks, syrups, sauces, whipped toppings, and sweets
- E-number: E432 (part of the polysorbate family E432–E436)
- Typically made from sorbitol, lauric acid (often from coconut or palm kernel oil), and ethylene oxide
- Approved with use limits in the EU and U.S.
- Usually suitable for vegetarians; vegan status depends on the source of the fatty acid—check with the manufacturer

## Why is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate added to food?
Food and drink often combine oily ingredients (like citrus oils) with water. E432 lowers the surface tension between them so the mix stays uniform, clear, and stable. This improves shelf life, stops “ringing” in beverages (oil rising to the top), and keeps sauces smooth during storage and transport.

## What foods contain Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate?
You’re most likely to see E432 in products that need to keep flavor oils dispersed or remain glossy and smooth:
- Clear soft drinks and flavored waters
- Syrups, flavor concentrates, and drink bases
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades
- Confectionery, fondants, and fillings
- Whipped toppings and dessert sauces
- Some bakery icings and glazes

## What can replace Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and the kind of oil or flavor to be dispersed:
- Other polysorbates: [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate](/e434-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monopalmitate), [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate), [polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate](/e436-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-tristearate)
- Non-polysorbate emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Sorbitan esters (non-ethoxylated): [sorbitan monolaurate](/e493-sorbitan-monolaurate), [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), [sorbitan tristearate](/e492-sorbitan-tristearate), [sorbitan monopalmitate](/e495-sorbitan-monopalmitate)

## How is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate made?
- First, sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) is dehydrated to make sorbitan.
- Sorbitan is then esterified with lauric acid (a C12 fatty acid) to produce sorbitan monolaurate.
- Finally, ethylene oxide is reacted with the sorbitan monolaurate to add polyoxyethylene chains, creating the “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate” structure known as polysorbate 20.[^1]
This process and identity are defined in the EU food additive specifications for E432–E436.[^1]

## Is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate safe to eat?
In the European Union, E432–E436 (the polysorbates) have a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg per kg body weight per day, established by EFSA after reviewing toxicology, metabolism, and exposure data.[^2] In the United States, polysorbate 20 is permitted as a direct food additive with specified uses and limits in the Code of Federal Regulations.[^3] These assessments support its safety when used as authorized in foods.

## Does Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate have any benefits?
E432 does not provide nutritional benefits. Its value is technological: it keeps oil-soluble flavors evenly dispersed, helps products stay clear and uniform, and protects texture during storage and temperature changes. That can reduce waste and improve consistency in beverages, sauces, and sweets.

## Who should avoid Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate?
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to polysorbates should avoid products containing E432 and follow medical advice.
- People with specific dietary requirements (such as strict vegan) may wish to confirm the source of the fatty acid, since manufacturers can derive lauric acid from different raw materials.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Polysorbate 20 is antifreeze.” Fact: It is a food-grade emulsifier. While ethylene oxide is used during manufacturing, the final product is a different compound designed for food use and is regulated for purity.[^1]
- Myth: “If it’s in drinks, it must be unsafe.” Fact: Safety authorities in the EU and U.S. have evaluated polysorbates and allow them with defined limits that keep intake within safe levels.[^2][^3]
- Myth: “All polysorbates are the same.” Fact: Different polysorbates carry different fatty acids (laurate, oleate, stearate, etc.), so their performance in specific foods can vary.

## Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate in branded foods
Many large beverage, confectionery, and bakery brands use E432 to stabilize flavor oils, keep products clear, and improve the look and feel of toppings and glazes. Labels typically list it as “polysorbate 20” or “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate.”
