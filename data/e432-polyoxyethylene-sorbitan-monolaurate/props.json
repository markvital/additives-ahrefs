  "description": "Polysorbate 20 -common commercial brand names include Scattics, Alkest TW 20 and Tween 20- is a polysorbate-type nonionic surfactant formed by the ethoxylation of sorbitan before the addition of lauric acid. Its stability and relative nontoxicity allows it to be used as a detergent and emulsifier in a number of domestic, scientific, and pharmacological applications. As the name implies the ethoxylation process leaves the molecule with 20 repeat units of polyethylene glycol; in practice these are distributed across 4 different chains leading to a commercial product containing a range of chemical species.",
