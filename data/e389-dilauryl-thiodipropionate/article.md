Dilauryl thiodipropionate (E389) is a synthetic antioxidant. It helps keep fats and oils from turning rancid by slowing oxidation. You may see it on labels as E389 or DLTDP in some regions, though today it is more often used in food-contact packaging than added directly to foods.

## At a glance
- An antioxidant that protects fats and oils from going rancid
- Also called DLTDP; the E-number is E389
- More common today in food-contact plastics than as a direct ingredient in foods in some markets[^1]

## Why is dilauryl thiodipropionate added to food?
Manufacturers use antioxidants to slow oxidation, the process that makes fats taste stale and smell “off.” E389 helps keep flavor and color stable in fat-rich foods during storage and shipping. It is often used alongside other antioxidants to boost overall protection.

## What foods contain dilauryl thiodipropionate?
If used as a direct additive, it would most likely appear in fat- and oil-rich products such as shortenings, frying oils, snacks, or some instant mixes. In the United States, it is far more commonly approved for use in food-contact materials (like some plastics) rather than added to foods themselves, so you may not often see it on ingredient lists there.[^1]

## What can replace dilauryl thiodipropionate?
Food makers can choose other antioxidants, depending on the recipe and local rules:
- [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha) and [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene)
- [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- [Propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate)
- [Ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate) and [tocopherols (vitamin E)](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)
- Synergists like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid)
- Plant-based options such as [rosemary extract](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)

## How is dilauryl thiodipropionate made?
E389 is the dilauryl ester of [thiodipropionic acid](/e388-thiodipropionic-acid). In simple terms, it is made by joining lauryl alcohol (a fatty alcohol) to thiodipropionic acid to form an ester. It is a waxy, fat-loving antioxidant designed to dissolve in oils and fats.[^2]

## Is dilauryl thiodipropionate safe to eat?
Safety depends on the use and the level. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows dilauryl thiodipropionate as an antioxidant/stabilizer in certain food-contact polymers, with conditions that are meant to limit how much can migrate into food.[^1] In the European Union, the use of substances in food-contact plastics is controlled under a specific regulation that sets rules and limits for such applications.[^3] If you see E389 on a label, that means it is regulated as a food additive in that jurisdiction; follow local guidance and serving recommendations.

## Does dilauryl thiodipropionate have any benefits?
For manufacturers, it helps:
- Keep fats and oils from going rancid
- Maintain flavor, aroma, and color during shelf life
- Reduce waste by improving product stability

For consumers, this can mean food that tastes fresher for longer.

## Who should avoid dilauryl thiodipropionate?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic antioxidants can choose products that use alternatives like [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) or [rosemary extract](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary).
- If your health professional has advised you to avoid certain additives, check labels for “dilauryl thiodipropionate,” “DLTDP,” or “E389.”
- Always follow local regulations and dietary advice for infants, young children, or medical diets.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are banned in the U.S.” Fact: E-numbers are EU codes; many of the same substances are allowed in the U.S. under chemical names or separate approvals.
- Myth: “Antioxidant means vitamin.” Fact: Food antioxidants include vitamins like vitamin E as well as non-vitamin compounds designed to protect fats.
- Myth: “If it’s in packaging, it ends up in your food.” Fact: Food-contact uses are regulated with conditions intended to limit migration into food.[^1][^3]

## Dilauryl thiodipropionate in branded foods
You may rarely see E389 on modern labels in some markets. If present, it should appear as “dilauryl thiodipropionate,” “DLTDP,” or “E389.” It can also appear in supply-chain materials (like plastic packaging) rather than in the ingredient list of the food itself, depending on local approvals.[^1]
