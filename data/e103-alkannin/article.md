Alkannin (E103) is a red plant dye that is not allowed in U.S. foods. If you see “E103,” “alkannin,” or “alkanet root” on a food label, avoid the product in the U.S.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Alkannin; E103
- What it does: Color additive (red); historically used to tint oils and liqueurs
- Common in: Not permitted in U.S. foods; may appear in some cosmetics and craft colorants
- Diet flags: Plant-derived/vegan, but not an approved food color in the U.S. or EU today

1) Why it's added to food
- Main point: It is a coloring agent that gives a red to reddish-purple hue. It was historically used to color oils, cheeses, and liqueurs.

2) What foods it's found in
- Main point: It should not be in U.S. foods because it is not an FDA-approved color additive. Imported goods might list “E103” or “alkanet,” but U.S. products should not; avoid if you see it listed. Check labels for “E103,” “alkannin,” or “alkanet root.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Main point: Choose approved red colors instead. Look for beet juice color, red radish color (anthocyanins), grape skin/black carrot extracts, paprika extract, lycopene, or carmine/cochineal (not vegan).

4) How Alkannin is manufactured
- Main point: Alkannin is extracted from the roots of Alkanet (Alkanna tinctoria). Producers soak or extract the root with oil or alcohol, then purify the pigment; it dissolves well in fats and oils.

5) How safe is Alkannin for consumption?
- Main point: It is not approved for use in U.S. foods; FDA does not list it as a permitted color additive. The EU also does not authorize E103 today.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Main point: There are traditional topical uses (for example, in ointments) for alkanet pigments, but these are not food uses. There are no FDA-approved health benefits from eating alkannin.

7) When Alkannin may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Main point: Do not consume in foods, since it is not an approved color additive. Avoid if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or giving to children; safety for ingestion is not established. People with sensitive skin may react to alkanet-containing cosmetics; stop use if irritation occurs.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “E103 is approved and safe to use in U.S. foods.” Fact: It is not an approved color additive for U.S. foods. Source: FDA (fda.gov).
- Myth: “If it has an E-number, it must be allowed in the EU.” Fact: E103 is not currently authorized as a food additive in the EU. Source: European Commission Food Additives (ec.europa.eu).
- Myth: “Alkannin is the same as carmine.” Fact: Alkannin is a plant pigment from alkanet root; carmine comes from insects and is a different compound. Source: PubChem (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Alkannin in Branded Foods
- Main point: U.S. branded foods should not list alkannin/E103, since it is not an approved color additive. If an imported label lists “E103,” do not purchase for food use in the U.S.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) Is E103 legal in U.S. foods?
- No. It is not an FDA-approved color additive for foods in the U.S. Avoid products listing “E103,” “alkannin,” or “alkanet” as ingredients.

2) Is Alkannin vegan?
- Yes, it is plant-derived. But it is not permitted in U.S. foods.

3) What can I use instead of E103 to color foods red?
- Use approved colors like beet juice color, anthocyanins (red radish, grape skin, black carrot), paprika extract, or lycopene. Carmine/cochineal is another option but is not vegan.

4) Will E103 appear on U.S. labels?
- U.S. labels should not list E103 on foods. Imported labels may show “E103,” but those products are not compliant for U.S. food use.

5) Can Alkannin be used in cosmetics?
- It may appear in some cosmetics or craft colorants. Follow product directions and stop use if skin irritation occurs.
