  "description": "Biphenyl -or diphenyl or phenylbenzene or 1‚1′-biphenyl or lemonene- is an organic compound that forms colorless  crystals.  Particularly in older literature, compounds containing the functional group consisting of biphenyl less one hydrogen -the site at which it is attached- may use the prefixes xenyl or diphenylyl.It has a distinctively pleasant smell. Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a molecular formula -C6H5-2. It is notable as a starting material for the production of polychlorinated biphenyls -PCBs-, which were once widely used as dielectric fluids and heat transfer agents. Biphenyl is also an intermediate for the production of a host of other organic compounds such as emulsifiers, optical brighteners, crop protection products, and plastics. Biphenyl is insoluble in water, but soluble in typical organic solvents. The biphenyl molecule consists of two connected phenyl rings.",
