      "q": "is biphenyl polar",
      "a": "No—biphenyl is essentially nonpolar due to its symmetric aromatic hydrocarbon structure and lack of polar functional groups.",

    {
      "q": "is biphenyl polar or nonpolar",
      "a": "Nonpolar; it has no significant dipole moment.",

    {
      "q": "is biphenyl soluble in methanol",
      "a": "Only sparingly; it dissolves much better in nonpolar organic solvents, with limited solubility in methanol that increases with heat.",

      "q": "what is a polychlorinated biphenyl",
      "a": "A PCB is a biphenyl molecule with multiple chlorine atoms attached; these synthetic chemicals were used as dielectric and coolant fluids but are now widely restricted due to persistence and toxicity.",
