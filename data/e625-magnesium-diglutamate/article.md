Magnesium diglutamate (E625) is a flavor enhancer from the glutamate family, the same group as MSG but with magnesium instead of sodium. It boosts savory, “umami” taste in seasonings and many ready-to-eat foods and is regulated in the EU as a permitted food additive.

## At a glance
- Role: Umami flavor enhancer in the glutamate family (E620–E625)
- Typical uses: Savory snacks, soups, sauces, seasonings
- How it’s made: Neutralizing L-glutamic acid (often produced by fermentation) with a magnesium base
- Dietary note: Provides umami without adding sodium
- Safety: Evaluated by EFSA with a group ADI (acceptable daily intake) for glutamic acid and its salts; some people report sensitivity to high single intakes

## Why is Magnesium diglutamate added to food?
Food makers use magnesium diglutamate to boost savory, meaty, and brothy notes, a taste known as “umami.” In the EU it is authorized as a flavor enhancer under the code E625, one of the glutamate additives grouped as E620–E625.[^2]

You may see it used alone or alongside other umami boosters, such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), or [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), to achieve a balanced savory profile.

## What foods contain Magnesium diglutamate?
Magnesium diglutamate can appear in the same kinds of products that use other glutamate flavor enhancers: dry soup mixes, canned or instant soups, sauces and gravies, savory snacks, seasoning blends, and some prepared meats.[^3] Glutamate itself also occurs naturally in foods like tomatoes and aged cheeses, which is why those foods taste savory even without added flavor enhancers.[^3]

## What can replace Magnesium diglutamate?
- Other glutamates: [glutamic acid](/e620-glutamic-acid), [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [monopotassium glutamate](/e622-monopotassium-glutamate), or [calcium diglutamate](/e623-calcium-diglutamate)
- Nucleotide enhancers: [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate) or [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate)
- Ingredient-based umami: yeast extract, mushroom concentrates, fermented soy sauces, tomato concentrates, or slow-cooked stocks

## How is Magnesium diglutamate made?
Commercial L‑glutamic acid is typically produced by microbial fermentation of carbohydrate sources. The acid is then neutralized with a suitable magnesium base to form the magnesium salt—magnesium diglutamate—which is purified and dried for use in foods.[^1]

## Is Magnesium diglutamate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group ADI of 30 mg/kg body weight per day for glutamic acid and its salts (E620–E625), expressed as glutamic acid. EFSA also reported that some population groups—especially young children with higher intake per body weight—could exceed that ADI under certain high-intake scenarios and recommended lowering some maximum use levels.[^1] In the United States, the FDA considers glutamate flavor enhancers such as MSG to be safe for the general population, noting that most people do not experience adverse effects under typical dietary conditions.[^3]

## Does Magnesium diglutamate have any benefits?
- Culinary: It reliably boosts umami, helping seasonings and savory foods taste fuller at low use levels.
- Formulation: Because it contains magnesium rather than sodium, it can add savory taste without increasing sodium from the flavor enhancer itself.

## Who should avoid Magnesium diglutamate?
- Individuals who report sensitivity to glutamates (for example, after large single servings of highly seasoned foods) may choose to limit intake and check labels for E625 or “magnesium diglutamate.”[^3]
- Caregivers of young children might be mindful of frequent consumption of foods with added glutamates, since EFSA identified potential ADI exceedance in high-intake scenarios.[^1]
- Anyone under medical advice to limit specific additives should follow their clinician’s guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All glutamates are the same as MSG.” Fact: The EU recognizes several glutamate additives (E620–E625), which include different salts such as magnesium diglutamate (E625).[^2]
- Myth: “Glutamates cause reactions in everyone.” Fact: Regulators consider them safe for the general population; a subset of people may report short‑lived symptoms after consuming large amounts in a single sitting.[^3]
- Myth: “Umami must come from artificial ingredients.” Fact: Glutamate occurs naturally in foods such as tomatoes and aged cheeses, which are prized for their savory taste.[^3]

## Magnesium diglutamate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “magnesium diglutamate,” “E625” (in the EU/UK), or it may appear within a broader “flavor enhancer” grouping. It is less commonly used than MSG, so you’ll often see it in blends alongside other flavor enhancers. If you’re monitoring intake, check the label of soups, snacks, seasoning mixes, sauces, and ready meals.
