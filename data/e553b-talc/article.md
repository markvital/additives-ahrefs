Talc (E553b) is a naturally occurring mineral used in foods as an anti-caking, anti-sticking, and glazing agent. It helps powders flow, keeps surfaces from sticking, and protects delicate coatings in products like confectionery and chewing gum. It is very insoluble and, when eaten, passes through the body largely unchanged.

## At a glance
- Names on labels: Talc, talcum, hydrated magnesium silicate, E553b
- What it does: Helps powders stay free-flowing, prevents sticking, and gives smooth, protective surface coatings
- Typical places you might see it: Coated confectionery and chewing gum, powdered mixes, seasoning blends, and some food supplements
- Chemistry: An insoluble magnesium silicate mineral; not appreciably absorbed when eaten
- Regulation: Authorised as a food additive in the European Union (EU); food-grade talc must be asbestos-free
- How to spot it: Listed as “talc,” “E553b,” or “hydrated magnesium silicate” on ingredients

## Why is Talc added to food?
Manufacturers use talc to solve practical problems in production. In powders, it keeps particles from clumping so the product pours and mixes evenly. On surfaces, it acts as a release and glazing agent so candies and gum do not stick to equipment or to each other, and their coatings stay smooth and intact.

## What foods contain Talc?
You are most likely to find talc in coated confectionery and chewing gum, in dry powdered foods where flowability matters, and in some pressed or powdered food supplements and tableted products. In the EU, talc (E553b) is authorised in several food categories as an anti-caking and glazing agent; the exact permitted uses and limits are set in the food additive law and its annexes.[^3] In the United States, talc is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for certain indirect uses in materials that contact food, which is separate from direct addition to foods.[^4]

## What can replace Talc?
Alternatives depend on the job:
- Anti-caking in powders: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide), [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate), or other permitted silicates such as [magnesium silicates](/e553-magnesium-silicates)
- Surface glazing or release: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- Tablet and supplement manufacturing: stearates such as [magnesium stearate](/e572-magnesium-stearate) may be used as lubricants in some applications

Each substitute has its own technical strengths and regulatory conditions.

## How is Talc made?
Food-grade talc is produced from naturally occurring talc ore (steatite). The rock is mined, carefully selected, cleaned to remove impurities, and finely milled to achieve the right particle size. Specifications in EU law define talc as a mineral consisting mainly of hydrated magnesium silicate and require that food-grade material be free from asbestos and meet strict purity limits.[^1]

## Is Talc safe to eat?
Based on a comprehensive review, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that talc (E553b) does not raise safety concerns at reported use levels in food. Because it is not appreciably absorbed from the gut, EFSA did not consider a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) necessary.[^2] EU specifications also set impurity limits and require asbestos-free material to ensure product quality and safety.[^1]

## Does Talc have any benefits?
For consumers, talc helps powders pour cleanly and keeps candies from sticking together, improving texture and appearance. For manufacturers, it stabilizes production by reducing clumping and sticking, which helps maintain consistent portioning and quality.

## Who should avoid Talc?
- People who prefer to limit additives in general can choose products without anti-caking or glazing agents.
- If a healthcare professional has advised you to avoid specific silicates or mineral additives, check labels for “talc,” “hydrated magnesium silicate,” or “E553b.”
- When handling dusty dry mixes at home, avoid creating airborne dust; use normal kitchen care and good ventilation.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Food-grade talc can contain asbestos.” Fact: Food additive specifications require talc to be asbestos-free and to meet strict purity limits.[^1]
- Myth: “Eating talc means magnesium from talc is absorbed.” Fact: Talc is very insoluble and is not appreciably absorbed when eaten; it is excreted largely unchanged.[^2]
- Myth: “Talc isn’t a food additive.” Fact: In the EU, talc is an authorised food additive (E553b) with defined conditions of use.[^3]
- Myth: “Talc and [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) are the same thing.” Fact: They are different substances with similar roles; talc is a magnesium silicate mineral, while silicon dioxide is pure silica.

## Talc in branded foods
Label it like a pro: look for “talc,” “talcum,” “hydrated magnesium silicate,” or “E553b” in the ingredient list. You’ll most often see it on products with smooth candy or gum coatings, or in dry mixes where clump-free pouring matters. Availability and uses vary by country and by brand, so always rely on the package label for the most accurate information.
