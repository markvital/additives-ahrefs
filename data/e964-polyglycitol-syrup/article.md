Polyglycitol syrup (E 964) is a bulk sweetener made from starch. It is a blend of sugar alcohols that sweetens, adds body, and helps foods stay moist without using regular sugar. You’ll find it in many “no‑sugar‑added” and sugar‑reduced candies, baked goods, and chewing gum.

## At a glance
- E-number: E 964
- What it is: A mixture of sugar alcohols (also called polyols) made from starch
- What it does: Adds sweetness, bulk, and moisture; helps control texture
- Common uses: Sugar‑reduced confectionery, baked goods, chewing gum, fillings, and coatings
- Notes: Like other polyols, high intakes can cause digestive upset; check labels for serving guidance

## Why is Polyglycitol syrup added to food?
Food makers use polyglycitol syrup as a “bulk sweetener.” That means it replaces not just sweetness but also the mass and texture that sugar provides. It also acts as a humectant, a substance that holds moisture so foods stay soft longer. Sugar alcohols can be used to support a U.S. dental health claim that they do not promote tooth decay when they replace sugars in foods.[^2]

Polyols is a short way to say “sugar alcohols.” They taste sweet but are metabolized differently from table sugar, which is why they are popular in sugar‑reduced recipes.

## What foods contain Polyglycitol syrup?
You’re most likely to see polyglycitol syrup in:
- Sugar‑reduced or “no‑sugar‑added” chocolates and coatings
- Chewy candies, caramels, toffees, and hard candies
- Chewing gum
- Cookies, cakes, and snack bars
- Dessert toppings, fillings, and some frozen desserts

Look for it in the ingredient list as “polyglycitol syrup” or by its number “E 964” on EU labels.

## What can replace Polyglycitol syrup?
Possible alternatives depend on the job it does in the recipe:
- For bulk sweetness: [maltitol](/e965-maltitol), [isomalt](/e953-isomalt), [lactitol](/e966-lactitol), [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol)
- For moisture and softness: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose)
- For extra sweetness (used with a bulking agent): [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides)

## How is Polyglycitol syrup made?
Manufacturers start with food‑grade starch (often from corn or wheat) and break it down into smaller sugars. They then hydrogenate these sugars—adding hydrogen with a catalyst—to convert them into sugar alcohols. The result is a syrup that contains a mixture of hydrogenated mono‑, di‑ and polysaccharides, with major components such as maltitol and sorbitol.[^1]

## Is Polyglycitol syrup safe to eat?
In the European Union, polyglycitol syrup is an authorized food additive (E 964) with detailed purity specifications, which include how it is made and what it contains.[^1] As with other sugar alcohols, eating a lot at once can cause gas or a laxative effect. In the EU, foods that contain more than 10% added polyols must carry the statement “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects.”[^3]

If you are new to polyols, try small portions first to check your personal tolerance.

## Does Polyglycitol syrup have any benefits?
- Fewer calories than sugar: For U.S. nutrition labeling, sugar alcohols are counted at 2.4 kcal per gram, compared with 4 kcal per gram for sugars.[^4]
- Tooth‑friendly when replacing sugars: Foods sweetened with sugar alcohols can carry a U.S. dental caries (tooth decay) claim when they meet the regulation’s conditions.[^2]
- Smaller impact on blood glucose than sugar: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that sugar alcohols generally have fewer calories and a lower effect on blood glucose than sugar.[^5]

## Who should avoid Polyglycitol syrup?
- People who notice digestive discomfort from polyols (bloating, gas, or loose stools) should limit portions. EU law even requires a label warning for foods high in added polyols, reflecting this known effect.[^3]
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit sugar alcohols—such as for digestive conditions—follow that guidance. The CDC also cautions that sugar alcohols can cause gastrointestinal upset for some people.[^5]
- Children may be more sensitive to large portions of polyols; serve smaller amounts.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sugar‑free means calorie‑free.” Fact: Sugar alcohols still provide calories, though fewer than sugar.
- Myth: “Polyglycitol syrup is the same as high‑intensity sweeteners.” Fact: It is a bulk sweetener; it adds body and moisture, not just sweetness.
- Myth: “If it’s a sugar alcohol, it contains alcohol.” Fact: Sugar alcohols contain no ethanol; the term describes their chemical structure.
- Myth: “If I tolerate one polyol, I’ll tolerate them all.” Fact: Tolerance varies by person and by type; portion size matters.

## Polyglycitol syrup in branded foods
You’ll often see polyglycitol syrup in sugar‑reduced chocolates, chewy candies, cough drops, chewing gum, cookies, snack bars, and dessert toppings. To spot it quickly, scan the ingredient list for “polyglycitol syrup” or, in the EU, the short label “E 964.” Many products pair it with another sweetener to fine‑tune taste and texture.
