Sucrose acetate isobutyrate (E444) is a dense, syrupy liquid made from sucrose and food-grade acids. In drinks, it helps keep citrus oils and flavor droplets evenly mixed so the beverage looks and tastes the same from first sip to last. It does not add sweetness or flavor on its own.

## At a glance
- What it does: Emulsifier and stabiliser that “weights” flavor oils so they stay suspended in beverages.
- Where it’s used: Citrus and fruit-flavored soft drinks, sports and energy drinks, and flavor emulsions used to make beverages.
- Also called: SAIB, E444; appears on labels as “sucrose acetate isobutyrate.”

## Why is sucrose acetate isobutyrate added to food?
Drink flavors often contain tiny droplets of oil (like citrus oils). Oil is lighter than water, so droplets can float and form a ring at the top. SAIB increases the density of the oil phase and stabilizes the emulsion, helping the flavor stay evenly mixed and the drink look clear and uniform.[^1]

## What foods contain sucrose acetate isobutyrate?
You’ll most often see E444 in:
- Citrus and other fruit-flavored soft drinks
- Sports and energy drinks
- Ready-to-drink flavored waters and juice drinks
- Beverage bases and syrups used in fountains and dispensers

It is used at very small amounts as part of the flavor emulsion, not as a sweetener or major ingredient.[^1]

## What can replace sucrose acetate isobutyrate?
The closest functional alternative is another “weighting agent,” such as [glycerol esters of wood rosin](/e445-glycerol-esters-of-wood-rosin). In the past, some markets used [brominated vegetable oil](/e443-brominated-vegetable-oil), but U.S. regulators have moved to revoke its authorization.[^3] Depending on the drink, formulators may also use emulsifiers and stabilizers like [polysorbate 80](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids) to help keep flavors dispersed.

## How is sucrose acetate isobutyrate made?
Manufacturers make SAIB by reacting sucrose with acetic and isobutyric acid derivatives (typically their anhydrides) to form a mixture of sucrose esters. The resulting dense, viscous liquid is then purified to meet identity and purity specifications set by regulators.[^1][^2]

## Is sucrose acetate isobutyrate safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. and EU permit SAIB for specific beverage uses and set detailed specifications for purity and use levels.[^1][^2] These permissions reflect reviews of safety data for its intended uses. As with any additive, manufacturers must follow the legal limits and specifications.

## Does sucrose acetate isobutyrate have any benefits?
- Product quality: Keeps citrus and other flavor oils evenly dispersed so drinks don’t separate.
- Consistent taste: Helps ensure the first and last sips taste the same.
- Appearance: Maintains a uniform look without a floating “oil ring.”

## Who should avoid sucrose acetate isobutyrate?
There are no specific restrictions for the general population beyond standard regulatory limits.[^1][^2] If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit emulsifiers or you prefer to avoid certain additives, check ingredient lists for “sucrose acetate isobutyrate,” “SAIB,” or “E444.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: SAIB is a sweetener because it comes from sucrose.  
  Fact: It is not a sweetener and is used in tiny amounts to stabilize flavors, not to add taste.
- Myth: SAIB is the same as brominated vegetable oil (BVO).  
  Fact: They are different additives. BVO’s U.S. status has been targeted for removal, while SAIB remains separately regulated for use within set limits.[^3][^1]
- Myth: SAIB makes drinks cloudy.  
  Fact: It helps match the density of flavor oils so the drink stays uniform; it doesn’t create cloudiness on its own.

## Sucrose acetate isobutyrate in branded foods
On labels, look for “sucrose acetate isobutyrate,” “SAIB,” or “E444.” You’ll most often find it on citrus sodas, fruit-flavored soft drinks, energy and sports drinks, and in the ingredient lists of beverage bases and flavor emulsions used by drink manufacturers.
