      "q": "how to prepare ammonium acetate buffer solution",
      "a": "Dissolve ammonium acetate in water to the desired concentration (e.g., 1 M: about 77 g per liter), then adjust pH to your target with acetic acid (to lower) or ammonia (to raise) and dilute to volume. Use food-/pharma-grade materials and verify pH after mixing.",

      "q": "is ammonium acetate soluble in water",

      "q": "ammonium acetate dissolves into what ions",
      "a": "It dissociates into ammonium (NH4+) and acetate (CH3COO−) ions.",

      "q": "ammonium acetate in what products contain",
      "a": "It may appear in some pickled products, sauces, and baked goods as an acidity regulator/buffer (E264). It’s relatively uncommon and is often replaced by sodium or potassium acetates.",

    {
      "q": "consider the reaction when aqueous solutions of ammonium acetate and sodium phosphate are combined.",
      "a": "All ions remain in solution (no precipitate), leaving NH4+, CH3COO−, Na+, and phosphate species in equilibrium. In a sufficiently basic phosphate solution, some NH4+ can convert to ammonia, making the mixture slightly basic and possibly giving a mild ammonia odor.",
