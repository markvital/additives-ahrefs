Ammonium acetate (E264) is a simple salt made from ammonia and vinegar’s main acid. Food makers use it in small amounts to control acidity and help keep some foods shelf-stable. It appears on labels as “ammonium acetate” or “E264.”

## At a glance
- What it is: the ammonium salt of acetic acid (a vinegar acid)
- What it does: helps regulate acidity (pH) and can support preservation
- Where you might see it: some pickled foods, condiments, and brines
- Label names: “ammonium acetate” or “E264”
- Related additives: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate), [sodium acetates](/e262-sodium-acetates), [calcium acetate](/e263-calcium-acetate)

## Why is ammonium acetate added to food?
Ammonium acetate acts mainly as an acidity regulator, helping a recipe reach and hold the right pH. Keeping pH in the target range supports taste, texture, and microbiological stability. In international standards, ammonium acetates are listed as acidity regulators and may be used for preservative purposes within set limits.[^2] In the EU, E264 has defined purity specifications as a food additive, which means it must meet strict identity and quality criteria before use.[^1]

## What foods contain ammonium acetate?
You may see E264 on the labels of acidified and preserved foods, such as certain pickled vegetables, relishes, condiments, and brines. Use varies by country and by brand, so always check the ingredient list for “ammonium acetate” or “E264.” Some makers prefer other acetates or different acids for the same job, so E264 is not universal.

## What can replace ammonium acetate?
Formulators often choose alternatives that deliver similar acidity control or preservation, including:
- [Acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) or other acetates like [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate), [sodium acetates](/e262-sodium-acetates), and [calcium acetate](/e263-calcium-acetate)
- Other food acids such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid)
- Preservatives used for specific microbes, like [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)

The best substitute depends on taste, pH target, and local rules.

## How is ammonium acetate made?
Ammonium acetate is typically produced by neutralizing acetic acid with ammonia, forming a white, crystalline salt. This straightforward reaction is widely described in chemical references, and the compound’s identity and properties are well established.[^3] In the EU, E264 must also meet food-grade purity criteria before it can be used in foods.[^1]

## Is ammonium acetate safe to eat?
Food additives placed on the EU Union list must be shown to be safe at proposed use levels and must serve a defined technological purpose.[^4] Ammonium acetates are included in the Codex (international) food standards system as acidity regulators and are used within good manufacturing practice and any category limits that apply.[^2] When consumed, the ammonium part is handled by normal human metabolism: the body converts ammonia to urea in the liver for excretion.[^5]

## Does ammonium acetate have any benefits?
For consumers, the benefit is indirect: better pH control can keep flavors consistent, protect texture, and support shelf life. For manufacturers, E264 can be a practical way to fine-tune acidity in formulas where a neutral-tasting acetate is preferred.

## Who should avoid ammonium acetate?
- People with urea cycle disorders need careful ammonia management and should follow medical guidance about all sources of nitrogen and ammonia, including ammonium salts.[^6]
- Those with severe liver disease (who may have trouble converting ammonia to urea) should seek medical advice on diet. This is a general precaution, since ammonia handling primarily depends on liver function.[^5]

For everyone else, normal food uses are small and within regulatory limits.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Ammonium acetate is the same as household ammonia.” Fact: It’s a salt made from ammonia and acetic acid; it behaves differently from liquid ammonia cleaner.
- Myth: “If an ingredient has ‘ammonium,’ it must be unsafe.” Fact: Ammonium is a common food component; for example, [ammonium hydroxide](/e527-ammonium-hydroxide) is also regulated for specific uses, and safety depends on dose and context.
- Myth: “E-numbers are artificial and banned outside Europe.” Fact: E-numbers are simply EU identifiers for approved additives; countries worldwide use many of the same substances under different naming systems.

## Ammonium acetate in branded foods
Ingredient lists are the best guide. Look for “ammonium acetate” or “E264” on jars of pickled items, condiments, and other acidified foods. Because companies reformulate and rules differ by country, the presence of E264 can vary across regions and product lines.
