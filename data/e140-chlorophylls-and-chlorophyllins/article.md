Chlorophylls and chlorophyllins (E140) are green color additives made from the pigments that give plants their green hue. They are used to make foods look fresh, plant-like, or minty, and come in oil‑soluble (chlorophylls) and more water‑soluble (chlorophyllins) forms. They are authorized in the European Union and must meet strict purity rules.

## At a glance

- What it is: Natural green color from plants (chlorophylls) and their more water‑soluble salts (chlorophyllins)
- E‑number: E140
- What it does: Colors foods green
- Where it comes from: Extracted from edible plant material; chlorophyllins are made by converting chlorophyll
- Typical form: Deep green powder or liquid dispersions
- Common uses: Confectionery, desserts, sauces, beverages, seasonings
- Dietary notes: Plant‑derived; usually suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets
- Label names: “Chlorophyll,” “Chlorophylls,” “Chlorophyllins,” or “E140”

## Why is Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins added to food?

Food makers add E140 to give a clean, leafy green color. This can signal flavors like mint, lime, basil, or spinach, or simply make a product look fresh and plant‑based. In EU law, E140 covers two groups: chlorophylls (E140(i)) and chlorophyllins (E140(ii)).[^1] Chlorophylls are magnesium‑containing plant pigments responsible for the green color of leaves.[^3] Chlorophyllins are related salts that are more water‑dispersible and can be easier to use in drinks and gels.[^1]

If a stable green is needed in acidic foods (like some soft drinks or pickled items), manufacturers may instead choose the copper complexes of these pigments listed as [copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) (E141).

## What foods contain Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins?

You may find E140 in:
- Mint and lime candies, chewing gum, and fillings
- Ice creams, sorbets, and dessert toppings
- Pesto and herb sauces, salad dressings, and dips
- Noodles and pasta with “spinach” or “herb” claims
- Seasoning mixes, flavored oils, and bakery icings
- Some beverages, smoothies, and syrups

On labels it can appear as “Chlorophyll,” “Chlorophyllins,” or “E140.”

## What can replace Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins?

Color choices depend on the food and its acidity.
- For a very stable green in acidic foods, many producers use [copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) (E141).
- Custom greens can be made by blending other colors, for example yellow tones such as [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) or [beta‑carotene](/e160a-carotene) with a blue like [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf). In more “natural color” lines, a blue such as [gardenia blue](/e165-gardenia-blue) can be paired with a yellow to reach green.
- Some products use vegetable or herb powders when a processed additive is not desired, though shades and stability vary.

## How is Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins made?

Chlorophylls (E140(i)) are obtained by extracting pigments from edible plant material (such as leafy greens) using food‑approved solvents, followed by purification and standardization to meet official specifications.[^1] Chlorophyllins (E140(ii)) are then produced by converting chlorophyll with alkali to form more water‑soluble sodium or potassium salts, and are likewise purified to specification.[^1] Chemically, chlorophylls are magnesium‑containing porphyrin pigments that naturally color plant tissues green.[^3]

## Is Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins safe to eat?

In the European Union, E140 is an authorized food color, and its use is controlled under the general food additive regulation.[^2] The additive must meet detailed identity and purity criteria (including limits for certain contaminants and processing residues) laid down in EU specifications before it can be used in food.[^1]

## Does Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins have any benefits?

The benefit is technological: it adds a green color that helps with product identity and appeal. E140 is not used for nutrition or medical effects, and foods containing it should be chosen like any other colored food—based on overall ingredients and nutrition.

## Who should avoid Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins?

Most people do not need to avoid E140. You may choose to avoid it if:
- You prefer foods without added colors
- You follow a diet that excludes any processed color additives
If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit copper intake, note that this advice concerns E141 (the copper complexes), not E140. Always check the label if you are unsure.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “E140 is synthetic.”  
  Fact: E140 is made from plant pigments; chlorophyllins are derived from chlorophyll.
- Myth: “Chlorophyll supplements and E140 are the same.”  
  Fact: Food‑grade E140 is standardized for coloring; supplements may contain different forms and amounts for other intended uses.
- Myth: “E140 makes foods healthier.”  
  Fact: It only adds color; it does not turn a food into a health food.

## Chlorophylls and Chlorophyllins in branded foods

Look for “Chlorophyll,” “Chlorophyllins,” or “E140” in the ingredient list. It shows up in green candies, mint gums, herb sauces like pesto, some ice creams, and drinks or syrups that need a natural‑leaning green. The exact shade depends on the recipe, acidity, and whether chlorophylls or chlorophyllins are used.
