Amidated pectin (E440II) is a plant-based gelling and thickening agent made from fruit peels. It sets reliably even with less sugar and works well in acidic foods like jams, yogurts, and fruit drinks. It is widely approved and used in many everyday products.

## At a glance
- What it is: A form of pectin that has been gently modified with ammonia to improve gelling; it is still a fruit-derived soluble fiber.
- What it does: Thickens, stabilizes, and forms gels, especially in low-sugar or calcium-rich recipes.
- Where it’s found: Reduced-sugar jams, fruit preparations, dairy and plant-based desserts, beverages, fillings, and glazes.
- Dietary notes: Plant-based and suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.
- Regulation: Recognized as safe in the U.S. when used as intended and re-evaluated in the EU with no safety concern for the general population at typical uses.[^1][^3]

## Why is Amidated pectin added to food?
Food makers use amidated pectin to create smooth, stable textures and to form gels that hold their shape. Compared with regular [pectins](/e440-pectins), it sets more easily and can gel with less sugar, which is useful for reduced-sugar jams and fruit spreads. It functions as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier under good manufacturing practice in the U.S.[^1] Amidation also improves how pectin binds with calcium, helping products set in a reliable way across a wide range of recipes.[^3]

## What foods contain Amidated pectin?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Reduced-sugar jams and fruit spreads
- Fruit-on-the-bottom or stirred yogurts and dairy desserts
- Plant-based desserts, puddings, and gels
- Fruit preparations for bakery, fillings, and glazes
- Juice drinks, smoothies, and flavored waters
On labels it may appear as “amidated pectin,” “E440ii/E440II,” or “pectin (amidated).”

## What can replace Amidated pectin?
Alternatives depend on the recipe:
- For firm gels: [agar](/e406-agar), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), or [gelatine](/e428-gelatine) in non-vegan products
- For thickening and stability: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum)
- For body and sheen: [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) or [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch)
Note that these ingredients behave differently. Recipes may need testing to match texture, clarity, and flavor release.

## How is Amidated pectin made?
Pectin is extracted from citrus peels or apple pomace with hot, mildly acidic water, then purified and dried. Amidated pectin is produced by treating pectin with ammonia, a step that converts some of the natural methyl groups into amide groups and changes how the pectin gels.[^1] In the EU, detailed specifications define identity and quality, including the allowed degree of amidation and esterification for E 440.[^2]

## Is Amidated pectin safe to eat?
Yes. In the U.S., pectin (including low‑methoxyl and amidated forms) is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated pectin and amidated pectin and found no safety concern for the general population at reported use levels; it also set specific considerations for use in certain infant foods.[^3]

## Does Amidated pectin have any benefits?
Culinary benefits include clean fruit flavor release, glossy gels, and stable textures that hold up to heat and acidity. Because it can gel with less sugar and with calcium, it is popular in reduced‑sugar recipes and fruit preparations. Amidated pectin is a soluble fiber, but the amounts used as an additive are usually small, so it is not a meaningful fiber source on its own.

## Who should avoid Amidated pectin?
- Infants and very young children: EFSA set specific conditions for certain infant foods, so caregivers should follow product directions and seek advice from healthcare professionals when needed.[^3]
- People with severe fruit allergies: Although rare, those sensitive to citrus or apple byproducts should consult a professional before use.
- Individuals on medically restricted diets: Ask a clinician if thickened or gelled foods are limited for your condition.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s artificial. Fact: Amidated pectin is made from fruit peels; amidation fine‑tunes its gelling.
- Myth: It’s the same as gelatin. Fact: It’s plant‑based and sets by acidity and calcium, not animal collagen.
- Myth: It always needs lots of sugar. Fact: Amidated pectin can set low‑sugar recipes with help from calcium.

## Amidated pectin in branded foods
You’ll find it on ingredient lists for many reduced‑sugar jams and preserves, fruit‑on‑the‑bottom yogurts, smoothie drinks, fruit fillings for pastries, and some plant‑based desserts. It may be paired with calcium salts such as [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride) to help the gel set, and with acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to adjust tartness and pH.
