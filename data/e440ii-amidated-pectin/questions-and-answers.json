      "q": "how to tell if your pectin is amidated",
      "a": "Check the ingredient label or spec sheet for “amidated pectin,” “LM amidated pectin,” or “E440(ii)”—it may also list a “degree of amidation (DA).” Kitchen behavior isn’t a reliable identifier since both amidated and non‑amidated low‑methoxyl pectins gel with calcium.",

    {
      "q": "what is non-amidated pectin",
      "a": "Pectin that hasn’t been reacted with ammonia to form amide groups; it’s typically labeled simply as pectin or E440(i). It may be high‑methoxyl (gels with high sugar and acid) or low‑methoxyl non‑amidated (gels with calcium but usually needs more calcium and is less heat‑reversible than amidated types).",
