Dimethyl sulfone, also called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), is an organosulfur compound found in very small amounts in some foods and in the human body. It is best known as a dietary supplement and is not assigned an E‑number as a food additive in the EU. MSM is often marketed for joint health, though evidence of benefit is mixed.

## At a glance
- Also known as methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and methyl sulfone
- Naturally present in trace amounts in some foods; most intake comes from supplements
- Commonly sold for joint support; research shows mixed, modest effects
- Generally well tolerated; mild stomach upset and headache are the most reported side effects
- Regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement ingredient, not as an approved food additive

## Why is dimethyl sulfone added to food?
Most manufacturers do not add dimethyl sulfone to ordinary foods. In the U.S., it is primarily sold as a dietary supplement ingredient intended for joint health or sports recovery, not as a standard food additive with a technological function like preservation, thickening, or coloring.[^2][^3]

## What foods contain dimethyl sulfone?
Dimethyl sulfone occurs naturally in very small amounts in a variety of foods, including cow’s milk, coffee, tea, tomatoes, corn, alfalfa sprouts, and beer.[^1] In practice, most consumer exposure comes from MSM-containing supplements rather than from typical foods.[^2]

## What can replace dimethyl sulfone?
Because dimethyl sulfone is rarely used as a functional food additive, there is usually nothing specific to replace in recipes. If a product uses MSM for a “joint” or “recovery” positioning, companies may instead adjust flavor, texture, or stability using established additives (for example, [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for tartness or [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) for antioxidant protection), but these do not replicate MSM’s proposed nutritional role. Always choose alternatives based on the intended function (taste, texture, shelf-life) rather than expecting another additive to provide the same health claim.

## How is dimethyl sulfone made?
Commercial MSM is typically produced by oxidizing dimethyl sulfoxide (often abbreviated DMSO) to form dimethyl sulfone (sometimes written as DMSO2), followed by purification steps such as crystallization and distillation to achieve high purity.[^1]

## Is dimethyl sulfone safe to eat?
Studies suggest MSM is generally well tolerated in adults at commonly used supplemental intakes, with mild side effects such as bloating, nausea, diarrhea, headache, or trouble sleeping reported by some users.[^2] In the U.S., MSM in capsules, powders, and similar formats is regulated as a dietary supplement ingredient; supplements do not require FDA premarket approval, and manufacturers are responsible for ensuring safety and proper labeling.[^3]

## Does dimethyl sulfone have any benefits?
Research on MSM for joint pain and function shows mixed results. Some small studies report modest improvements in symptoms like pain and stiffness, while others find little to no benefit.[^2] Evidence for uses beyond joint health (such as recovery from exercise) is still limited and not conclusive.[^2]

## Who should avoid dimethyl sulfone?
- People who are pregnant or breastfeeding, due to limited safety data in these groups.[^2]
- Individuals who experience side effects such as stomach upset or headache may wish to stop use and consult a clinician.[^2]
- Anyone considering MSM alongside prescription medicines should consult a healthcare professional, as dietary supplements can interact with treatments even when specific interaction data are limited.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: MSM is the same as sulfur dioxide preservative. Fact: MSM is a stable organic sulfur compound; it is not the same substance as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide) used to preserve some foods.[^1]
- Myth: MSM is a proven cure for arthritis. Fact: Evidence is mixed and generally shows, at best, modest benefits for symptoms in some people; it is not a cure.[^2]
- Myth: “Natural” means risk-free. Fact: Even naturally occurring compounds can cause side effects or interact with medications; supplement products are not reviewed by FDA before marketing.[^3]

## dimethyl sulfone in branded foods
You will most often see dimethyl sulfone listed as “MSM” on dietary supplement labels, including capsules, tablets, drink mixes, and gummies. It is uncommon in everyday packaged foods. Some “functional” products may feature MSM in specialized formats (for example, sports nutrition powders), but this is part of supplement-style positioning rather than a typical food use.[^2]
