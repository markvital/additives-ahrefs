Cochineal (E120) is a natural red food color made from the cochineal insect. It adds pink to deep red shades to drinks, dairy, candies, and more, and is regulated for safety and labeling in many countries. Some people are allergic, and it is not suitable for vegan or vegetarian diets.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural red color from the cochineal insect; includes cochineal extract and its aluminum/calcium “lake” called carmine.
- What it does: Colors foods and drinks from pink to deep red.
- Also called: Carminic acid, carmine, Natural Red 4, E120 (EU label).
- Common in: Flavored drinks, yogurts, ice creams, fruit preps, confectionery, bakery fillings, and processed foods.
- Dietary note: Insect-derived; not vegan or vegetarian.

## Why is Cochineal added to food?
Food makers use cochineal to give products a stable, appetizing red hue when fruit color alone would fade or vary. In the United States it is an approved color additive “exempt from certification,” which means it doesn’t need batch-by-batch FDA dye certification but must meet identity and purity rules. [^1]

## What foods contain Cochineal?
You may find E120 in fruit-flavored yogurts, dairy desserts, ice creams, gummies and hard candies, icings, bakery fillings, jams and fruit spreads, ready-to-drink beverages, and some savory items where a pink-red tint is desired. On ingredient lists, look for “carmine,” “cochineal extract,” or, in the EU, “E120.”

## What can replace Cochineal?
Depending on the shade and processing needs, formulators may switch to:
- Plant reds such as [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) or [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins).
- Bright synthetic reds like [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red) or [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r).
- Warm reds/oranges like [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) or [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene).

Each alternative has different stability to heat, light, and acidity, so the best choice depends on the food and the desired color.

## How is Cochineal made?
Cochineal extract is prepared from the dried bodies of female cochineal insects (Dactylopius coccus). The color is pulled into water, and then filtered and concentrated. Carmine, the more commonly used form, is made by reacting the extract with aluminum or calcium salts to create a stable, insoluble “lake” pigment suitable for many foods. [^2]

## Is Cochineal safe to eat?
Cochineal extract and carmine are permitted color additives in U.S. foods when they meet identity and purity specifications and are used as stated in regulation. [^1] In the European Union, E120 (cochineal, carminic acid, carmines) has official composition and purity specifications set by EU law. [^2] A small number of people can have allergic reactions; to help consumers, U.S. labels must name “carmine” or “cochineal extract” in the ingredient list. [^3]

## Does Cochineal have any benefits?
- It provides a vivid, natural-looking red with good color strength.
- It works in many foods, including acidic drinks and dairy.
- It has little flavor impact at typical use levels.

## Who should avoid Cochineal?
- Anyone with a known allergy or prior reaction to carmine/cochineal should avoid products that list them; U.S. labels must declare them by name to help sensitive consumers. [^3]
- People following vegan or vegetarian diets often avoid E120 because it is insect-derived.
- If you are unsure, check with your healthcare provider, especially if you have a history of color-additive sensitivities.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Cochineal is an unregulated dye. Fact: It is regulated in both the U.S. and EU with strict identity and purity specifications. [^1][^2]
- Myth: It always appears on labels as “natural color.” Fact: In the U.S., it must be listed specifically as “carmine” or “cochineal extract.” [^3]
- Myth: It’s a synthetic chemical. Fact: It is derived from the cochineal insect.

## Cochineal in branded foods
To spot E120 in the market, read ingredient lists for “carmine” or “cochineal extract,” or look for “E120” in regions that use E-numbers. In the U.S., the specific name must be used rather than a generic “natural color,” which makes it easier to avoid if you’re sensitive or prefer not to consume insect-derived ingredients. [^3]
