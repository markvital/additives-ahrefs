Annatto bixin (E160BI) is an orange-red food color made from the seeds of the achiote tree (Bixa orellana). It is the oil‑soluble fraction of annatto extracts and is used to give foods a warm yellow to deep orange hue without changing flavor.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant-derived color from achiote seeds; the oil‑soluble component of annatto called bixin
- What it does: colors foods yellow–orange to orange‑red
- Typical uses: cheddar and other cheeses, spreads and margarines, snacks, bakery, sauces
- Solubility: oil‑soluble (the water‑soluble counterpart is norbixin)
- Also called: E160bi, bixin
- Regulatory status: authorized as a color additive in the EU and U.S.

## Why is Annatto bixin added to food?
Annatto bixin gives foods a consistent, appetizing color. It helps standardize the natural color of dairy and plant-based foods across seasons and batches. Because it is oil‑soluble and used at very low levels, it typically does not affect taste or texture.

## What foods contain Annatto bixin?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Cheddar and other colored cheeses, processed cheese slices, and cheese spreads
- Butter, margarines, and other yellow spreads
- Baked snacks (crackers, chips), cereals, and bakery items
- Sauces, dressings, and some prepared meals

On labels, it may appear as “annatto (color),” “bixin,” or “E160b/E160bi.” It is related to [annatto](/e160b-annatto) as a whole extract and to [annatto norbixin](/e160bii-annatto-norbixin), its water‑soluble form.

## What can replace Annatto bixin?
Depending on the shade and formulation, common alternatives include:
- [Beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) for yellow to orange tones
- [Paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for orange‑red hues
- [Curcumin](/e100-curcumin) from turmeric for bright yellow
- [Lycopene](/e160d-lycopene) for red‑orange
- [Plain caramel](/e150a-plain-caramel) for brownish golden shades

Color selection depends on solubility (oil vs water), stability, and the target hue.

## How is Annatto bixin made?
Bixin is obtained by extracting the red seed coat of Bixa orellana with vegetable oil or suitable solvents, concentrating the color, and formulating it for food use. In oil-based extracts, bixin is the main coloring compound; if the extract is processed to a water‑based form, bixin is converted to norbixin (the water‑soluble counterpart).[^2] Specifications in EU law describe the permitted starting materials, extraction conditions, and composition for annatto extracts, including bixin types.[^2]

## Is Annatto bixin safe to eat?
In the European Union, annatto extracts (including bixin) are authorized food colors with detailed purity criteria set in additive specifications.[^2] In the United States, annatto extract is a color additive exempt from certification and may be used in foods in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1][^3] These listings reflect evaluations by regulators that consider exposure, manufacturing, and specifications. FDA stands for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; EU refers to the European Union and its regulations.

## Does Annatto bixin have any benefits?
- Provides bright, stable yellow‑orange colors in fat‑containing foods
- Helps keep product appearance consistent through the year
- Generally neutral in taste at use levels, so it won’t mask flavors

## Who should avoid Annatto bixin?
- Anyone with a known sensitivity or allergy to annatto colorants
- People following dye‑free diets for personal or medical reasons
If you have concerns about colors in your diet, speak with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Annatto bixin is artificial.  
  Fact: It is derived from achiote seeds, though it is processed and standardized for safe, consistent use in foods.
- Myth: Bixin and norbixin are the same thing.  
  Fact: Bixin is oil‑soluble; norbixin is water‑soluble. Both come from annatto but behave differently in recipes.[^2]
- Myth: No regulator has looked at annatto colors.  
  Fact: U.S. FDA and EU authorities authorize annatto extracts for food use, and specifications and conditions of use are published publicly.[^1][^2]

## Annatto bixin in branded foods
Many everyday foods use annatto bixin for a familiar golden or orange look. Examples include cheddar and Colby cheeses, processed cheese slices, spreadable cheeses, yellow margarines and plant‑based spreads, certain crackers and chips, some breakfast cereals, and ready sauces. Check ingredient lists for “annatto,” “bixin,” or “E160b.”
