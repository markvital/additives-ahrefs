Calcium peroxide (E930) is an oxygen-releasing compound used mostly in flour and bakery processing. It helps strengthen dough and can lighten flour color, and it breaks down during mixing and baking into oxygen and calcium compounds. It is listed as a permitted food additive in several regulatory systems.

## At a glance
- What it is: An oxidizing agent that slowly releases oxygen in dough and flour.
- What it does: Conditions dough, improves bread structure, and can bleach or “mature” flour.
- Where it’s found: Some flours, breads, tortillas, and bakery mixes.
- Regulatory note: Authorized in the European Union as E930 with purity criteria; FDA lists it among permitted additives for specific uses in the U.S.

## Why is calcium peroxide added to food?
Bakers use calcium peroxide because it releases a small, steady amount of oxygen during mixing and proofing. This mild oxidation helps strengthen the gluten network in wheat dough, which can improve loaf volume and crumb structure. It is also used as a flour “maturing” or bleaching agent to standardize flour color and performance from batch to batch.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain calcium peroxide?
You may find calcium peroxide in:
- Wheat flour or self-rising flour (as a flour treatment agent)
- Bread, rolls, tortillas, flatbreads, and steamed buns (as a dough conditioner)
- Commercial baking mixes and dough improver blends

Use is limited by regulation and good manufacturing practice, and it is not present in every brand or product type.[^1][^4]

## What can replace calcium peroxide?
Depending on the goal, bakers often use:
- Ascorbic acid, a common flour improver and oxidant: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid)
- Enzymes that aid dough handling and volume: [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase), [lipase](/e1104-lipase)
- Process choices like longer fermentation or preferments
- Leavening systems for chemical aeration where appropriate: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)

No single substitute fits every recipe; formulators pick tools based on flour quality, process, and desired texture.

## How is calcium peroxide made?
Commercial calcium peroxide is typically produced by reacting a calcium base (such as calcium hydroxide) with hydrogen peroxide, then isolating and drying the product. The result is a pale, oxygen-rich powder that slowly decomposes to release oxygen under moist or warm conditions.[^3] In the EU, purity specifications and contaminants limits for E930 are defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is calcium peroxide safe to eat?
When used as allowed by law and within good manufacturing practice, regulators consider calcium peroxide safe for its intended uses in food. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists calcium peroxide among permitted food additives and points to the relevant regulations that control its use levels and purposes.[^1] In the European Union, it is authorized as E930 and must meet specific identity and purity criteria before it can be used in food.[^2]

During dough preparation and baking, calcium peroxide breaks down and acts as a source of oxygen; the decomposition reduces the amount of unchanged additive remaining in the finished bread.[^3]

## Does calcium peroxide have any benefits?
For manufacturers and bakers, calcium peroxide can:
- Improve dough handling and gas retention for better loaf volume
- Help standardize flour performance without aging flour for long periods
- Provide gentle bleaching of flour color to meet style or label expectations

These are processing and quality benefits; it is not added for nutritional value.

## Who should avoid calcium peroxide?
- People who prefer “no added oxidizers” or minimal-ingredient breads may choose products without flour treatment agents.
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to avoid specific oxidizing agents, check labels or ask the manufacturer.
- As always, individuals with wheat or gluten issues should focus on the grain itself rather than this additive.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as liquid hydrogen peroxide used as a disinfectant.”  
  Fact: Calcium peroxide is a solid, slow oxygen releaser. It is used in tiny amounts in dough and has different handling and behavior than bottled hydrogen peroxide.[^3]
- Myth: “It stays in bread and makes it ‘bleachy.’”  
  Fact: It decomposes during mixing and baking, serving mainly as a source of oxygen; that reaction reduces the amount present in the finished food.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s banned everywhere.”  
  Fact: It is authorized in the EU as E930 with set purity criteria, and the FDA lists it among permitted food additives for specified uses.[^1][^2]

## calcium peroxide in branded foods
Look for “calcium peroxide” or “E930” on ingredient lists, especially on flour bags, bread, tortillas, and baking mixes. Not all brands use it; some use alternatives like [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or enzyme-based improvers.
