Sodium orthophenyl phenol (E232) is a preservative most often used as a post‑harvest fungicide on citrus fruit peels. It helps control mold during storage and shipping so fruit stays fresh longer.

## At a glance
- E232 is the sodium salt of 2‑phenylphenol, used to stop mold growth on fruit rinds.
- It is mainly applied to the surface of citrus fruits after harvest.
- Regulators evaluate its use and set rules for residues on food.
- Common alternatives include [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), and [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate).

## Why is Sodium orthophenyl phenol added to food?
This preservative is used to prevent spoilage by molds during the long journey from orchard to store. It is effective against common citrus molds and helps maintain quality and shelf life when fruits are stored and transported in warm, humid conditions.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium orthophenyl phenol?
You are most likely to encounter E232 on the peel of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits. It is applied after harvest as a surface treatment in packinghouses, sometimes together with fruit waxes.[^2] In the United States, residues on food are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with tolerance limits set in federal rules.[^3]

If you prefer to minimize residues on the surface, rinse whole citrus under running water and dry with a clean towel before cutting or peeling.[^4]

## What can replace Sodium orthophenyl phenol?
Depending on the food and process, producers may choose other preservatives or approaches:
- Benzoates, such as [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- Sorbates, such as [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- Other post‑harvest options historically used on citrus, like [biphenyl](/e230-biphenyl)
- Protective wax coatings such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [shellac](/e904-shellac), sometimes used alongside preservatives

The best substitute depends on the target microbes, flavor needs, and local regulations.

## How is Sodium orthophenyl phenol made?
E232 is the sodium salt of [orthophenyl phenol](/e231-orthophenyl-phenol). In practice, manufacturers convert 2‑phenylphenol into its sodium salt form, which dissolves well in water and can be applied as a wash or dip to fruit surfaces.[^1]

## Is Sodium orthophenyl phenol safe to eat?
Food safety agencies have evaluated this preservative for its intended use. In the U.S., the EPA has assessed sodium o‑phenylphenate (the same substance as sodium orthophenyl phenol) and determined it can be used post‑harvest with risk‑management measures.[^2] The EPA also sets legal residue limits (tolerances) for citrus and some related commodities, which packinghouses must meet.[^3]

## Does Sodium orthophenyl phenol have any benefits?
Yes. By controlling mold on citrus peels, E232 helps reduce spoilage losses, keeps fruit marketable longer, and supports year‑round distribution. This can help limit food waste during storage and transport.

## Who should avoid Sodium orthophenyl phenol?
- Anyone who is sensitive to phenolic preservatives may prefer to avoid handling treated peels.
- If you experience skin irritation when handling citrus rinds, use gloves or avoid contact.
- As a general step for all produce, rinse whole fruits under running water before eating or cutting into them.[^4]

If a healthcare professional has advised you to avoid this class of preservatives, follow their guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It dyes the fruit.” Fact: E232 is a fungicide/preservative, not a color additive.
- Myth: “It’s banned everywhere.” Fact: In the U.S., it is permitted as a post‑harvest treatment with regulated residue limits.[^3]
- Myth: “Washing can’t remove it.” Fact: Rinsing produce under running water helps reduce surface residues and dirt.[^4]

## Sodium orthophenyl phenol in branded foods
You won’t usually see E232 on an ingredient list of packaged foods, because it is mainly used on whole citrus fruit after harvest. In stores, look for general statements on cartons or stickers such as “treated to maintain freshness.” If you want to limit contact, rinse the fruit and peel it before eating the segments.
