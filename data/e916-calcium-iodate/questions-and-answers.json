      "a": "In pure water, let s be molar solubility: Ksp = s(2s)^2 = 4s^3, so s = (Ksp/4)^(1/3); convert to g/L by multiplying s by the molar mass of Ca(IO3)2.",

      "a": "With [IO3−]0 = 0.1 M from KIO3, the iodate contributed by dissolving Ca(IO3)2 is 2s where s solves Ksp = s(0.1 + 2s)^2 (if 0.1 ≫ s, [IO3−] from Ca(IO3)2 ≈ 2Ksp/(0.1)^2).",
