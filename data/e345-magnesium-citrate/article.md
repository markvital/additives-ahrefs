Magnesium citrate (E345) is the magnesium salt of citric acid used to control acidity and help stabilize foods and drinks. In the EU it’s an authorized food additive with defined purity specifications and labeling options. It can also serve as a source of magnesium in fortified foods and supplements.

## At a glance
- **Also called / E-number:** Magnesium citrate; E345  
- **What it does:** Helps regulate acidity and bind metal ions (sequestrant) in foods[^2]  
- **Common in:** A range of processed foods and beverages where acidity control or stabilization is needed (check labels for “magnesium citrate” or “E345”)  
- **Diet flags:** None specific noted

## Why is Magnesium citrate added to food?
It’s added to manage acidity and improve stability in foods and beverages. In the EU, food additives like magnesium citrate (E-numbers) are authorized after safety evaluation, and E-numbers signal an additive is approved for use; E345 is listed and permitted under EU food additive rules.[^1][^2] When shopping, look for it near the end of ingredient lists where acidity regulators often appear, and remember that EU labels may use either the name or the E-number.[^1]

## What foods contain Magnesium citrate?
You’ll find magnesium citrate across various processed foods where acidity control or stabilization helps product quality. Examples include flavored drinks, powdered beverage mixes, jams and jellies, desserts, and some bakery items; it may also appear in fortified foods and dietary supplements as a magnesium source.[^7] Check labels for “magnesium citrate” or “E345,” and choose alternatives if you prefer products without added acidity regulators.

## What can replace Magnesium citrate?
Other citrates or acids can often do a similar job. Options include citric acid (/e330-citric-acid) for tartness and pH control, sodium citrates (/e331-sodium-citrates) or potassium citrates (/e332-potassium-citrates) for buffering and sequestration, and calcium citrates (/e333-calcium-citrates) when calcium fortification or specific texture goals are desired. Expect minor differences in taste, sodium/potassium content, or mineral contribution depending on the choice.

## How is Magnesium citrate made?
Food-grade magnesium citrate is defined as magnesium salts of citric acid and must meet EU identity and purity specifications. These specifications set criteria such as assay limits and impurity controls to ensure consistent quality for use in foods.[^3]

## Is Magnesium citrate safe to eat?
Within approved uses and levels, regulatory bodies consider magnesium citrate safe as a food additive. In the EU, it is authorized as E345 following safety evaluation, with manufacturers required to meet strict specifications and labeling rules.[^1][^2][^3]
- Authorized in the EU as E345 with defined purity criteria.[^2][^3]
- Additives in the EU are evaluated for safety before approval, and may be labeled by name or E-number on ingredient lists.[^1]
- As a magnesium compound, it can contribute dietary magnesium, but total intake from all sources should remain sensible.[^4]

## Does Magnesium citrate have any benefits?
In foods and supplements, it can supply magnesium, an essential mineral that supports many body functions. Magnesium citrate is one of the common forms used in dietary supplements to help maintain adequate magnesium intake.[^4][^7]

## Who should avoid Magnesium citrate?
People with kidney problems or those advised to limit magnesium should be cautious with magnesium from supplements and multiple fortified products. Excess magnesium from supplements or medications can cause diarrhea and stomach upset; read labels and consider total magnesium from all sources.[^4] If you’re limiting additives, scan ingredient lists for “magnesium citrate” or “E345.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “An E-number means the additive is unsafe.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is authorized in the EU after a safety evaluation, and it must meet strict rules and labeling requirements.[^1]
- Myth: “Magnesium citrate is just citric acid.” Fact: Magnesium citrate is the magnesium salt of citric acid; it has different properties and functions than citric acid itself.[^3]
- Myth: “If it’s in food, it will act like a laxative.” Fact: Magnesium citrate is a laxative only at medicinal doses; diarrhea and similar effects are linked to high intakes from supplements or drugs, not the small amounts used as additives.[^4]

## Magnesium citrate in Branded Foods
You’ll typically see it in flavored beverages, powdered drink mixes, shelf-stable desserts, and some fortified foods and supplements. Ingredient lists may show “magnesium citrate” or “E345” depending on the market.[^1]

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
**Q:** How will magnesium citrate appear on a label?  
**A:** In the EU, additives can be listed by functional class plus name or E-number (e.g., “acidity regulator: E345 magnesium citrate”).[^1]

**Q:** Is E345 allowed in the EU?  
**A:** Yes. It’s authorized as a food additive under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, with detailed purity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2][^3]

**Q:** Does magnesium citrate add magnesium to foods?  
**A:** It can contribute magnesium and is also a common form in dietary supplements.[^4][^7]

**Q:** Are there rules about how much can be used?  
**A:** EU legislation authorizes additives like E345 for specific food categories and conditions of use; manufacturers must comply with those rules.[^2]

**Q:** Can I avoid it if I want fewer additives?  
**A:** Yes. Check the ingredient list for “magnesium citrate” or “E345,” and choose products without it if you prefer.[^1]
