Magnesium citrate (E345) is a pH buffer and mineral source used in drinks and many processed foods. It helps control tartness, keeps flavors stable, and adds magnesium for fortification.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Magnesium citrate; E345
- What it does: Acidity regulator, buffer, sequestrant (binds metals), mineral fortification (magnesium source)
- Common in: Flavored waters, sports drinks, powdered drink mixes, fortified juices, dairy alternatives, canned fish/vegetables, seasoning blends
- Diet flags: Generally vegan and gluten-free; check brand certifications if you need kosher or halal

1) Why it's added to food
- It controls acidity and stabilizes flavor. It can also bind trace metals that cause off-colors or bitterness.
- It supplies magnesium for fortification. Look for it in beverages that promote electrolytes or added minerals.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You’ll see it in flavored waters, electrolyte and sports drinks, energy drink mixes, and fortified juices. It can appear in dairy alternatives, canned seafood or vegetables, and seasoning blends.
- Check labels for “magnesium citrate” in the ingredient list. In the EU it may appear as E345; in the U.S. it will list the name.

3) What are its alternatives
- For acidity and buffering, look for citric acid (E330), sodium citrate (E331), potassium citrate (E332), or calcium citrate (E333). These offer similar pH control.
- For magnesium fortification, brands may use magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, or magnesium lactate. Choose a product that fits your diet and taste.

4) How Magnesium citrate is manufactured
- Food-grade magnesium citrate is made by reacting citric acid with a magnesium source such as magnesium carbonate, oxide, or hydroxide. The mixture is filtered, crystallized, and dried.
- Manufacturers follow food-grade specs (e.g., FCC) to control purity, hydration state, and particle size.

5) How safe is Magnesium citrate for consumption?
- It is permitted as a food additive and acidity regulator, and it is widely evaluated for safety. In the U.S., magnesium citrate used in foods is recognized as safe when used as intended.

- EFSA re-evaluated citric acid and its salts, including magnesium citrate (E345), and did not identify safety concerns at reported use levels. Typical dietary exposures are well below levels linked to laxative effects.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Magnesium citrate is used in supplements to support magnesium intake. It has good bioavailability compared with some other magnesium salts.
- It is also used as an over-the-counter saline laxative at higher doses than found in foods. Follow product directions and talk to a pharmacist if you have questions.

7) When Magnesium citrate may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Avoid or limit if you have kidney disease or are on a magnesium-restricted diet. Magnesium can build up when kidneys do not clear it well.
- Be cautious if you take certain antibiotics (tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones). Minerals can reduce absorption; separate dosing as directed by your healthcare provider.
- Large supplemental doses can cause diarrhea and cramping. Food-use levels are much lower.

Myths & facts
- Myth: E-numbers like E345 are “chemical additives” to avoid. Fact: E-numbers are just EU codes for approved additives with safety reviews. Source: EFSA (efsa.europa.eu) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: Magnesium citrate in foods always causes diarrhea. Fact: Laxative effects occur at high supplement doses, not at typical food additive levels. Source: NIH ODS (ods.od.nih.gov) — URL to be added by editor
- Myth: All citrates are acidic and make foods very sour. Fact: Citrates are buffers that stabilize pH; they can reduce sharp acidity in some formulas. Source: FDA (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor

Magnesium citrate in Branded Foods
- You’ll mainly find it in flavored waters, sports and hydration drinks, powdered drink mixes, and some fortified juices. It also appears in a few canned foods and seasoning blends as a stabilizer.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is magnesium citrate safe to eat in foods? Yes, it is permitted and considered safe at normal use levels. Regulatory bodies have evaluated it for these uses.
- What does magnesium citrate do in drinks? It buffers acidity and helps stabilize flavor. It can also add magnesium as a nutrient.
- Will magnesium citrate upset my stomach? Most people tolerate the small amounts used in foods. High-dose supplements or laxatives may cause diarrhea.
- Is magnesium citrate vegan and gluten-free? It is a mineral salt and generally vegan and gluten-free. Check product certifications if you need kosher or halal.
- How can I avoid magnesium citrate? Read ingredient lists and choose products without “magnesium citrate.” Pick alternatives using citric acid or other citrates if you prefer.

Suggested shopping tips
- Check labels for “magnesium citrate” if you track magnesium intake. Choose fortified drinks if you want added minerals.
- Avoid products with magnesium citrate if your doctor advised limiting magnesium. Look for drinks buffered with citric acid or other citrates instead.
