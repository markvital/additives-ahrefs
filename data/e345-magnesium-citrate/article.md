Magnesium citrate (E 345) is a group of magnesium salts of citric acid used in foods and drinks. It mainly helps control tartness and pH so products taste consistent and keep their quality. You may also see it in the EU as a permitted mineral source in supplements and fortified foods.

## At a glance
- **Also called / E-number:** Magnesium citrates; E345  
- **What it does:** Helps regulate acidity (pH control)  
- **Common in:** Soft drinks and flavored waters, candies, jams/jellies, canned fruit, and some dairy drinks  
- **Diet flags:** No specific diet flags; check labels if you monitor magnesium intake  

## Why is Magnesium citrate added to food?
It’s added to adjust and stabilize acidity so the product’s flavor and quality stay consistent. In the EU, magnesium citrates are authorized as food additives under the Union list (E 345) and have official identity and purity specifications.[^1][^2] When shopping, expect to see it listed as “magnesium citrates” or “E 345.” Compare similar products if you prefer ones without extra acidity regulators.

## What foods contain Magnesium citrate?
You’ll most often find it in flavored beverages, sweets, and fruit-based products. Common examples include lemon-lime sodas, sports drinks, hard candies or gummies, jams and jellies, fruit cups or canned fruit, and some dairy or plant-based drinks; permitted uses and levels vary by category in the EU’s Union list.[^1] Check ingredient lists for “magnesium citrates” or “E 345.” Choose unsweetened or minimally processed options if you’re cutting back on additives.

## What can replace Magnesium citrate?
Other acidity regulators can often do a similar job, though taste and cost can differ. Alternatives include [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates), and [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates). These can change sodium/potassium content or tartness, so manufacturers pick based on flavor goals and nutrition targets.

## How is Magnesium citrate made?
It’s typically produced by neutralizing food-grade citric acid with magnesium compounds and then drying and screening the product to meet purity specs. EU specifications describe “magnesium citrates” as magnesium salts of citric acid and set identity tests, assay ranges, and impurity limits to ensure consistent quality for food use.[^2]

## Is Magnesium citrate safe to eat?
When used as permitted in foods, it’s considered safe by EU authorities.[^1]
- It’s on the EU Union list of authorized food additives (E 345), with uses generally at “quantum satis” (no more than needed to achieve the effect).[^1]
- EU specifications set identity and purity criteria (including limits for contaminants) for magnesium citrates used in food.[^2]
- EU labeling rules require additives to be named by function plus specific name or E-number (for example, “acidity regulator: magnesium citrates” or “acidity regulator: E 345”).[^3]
- Very high intakes of magnesium from supplements and medicines can cause diarrhea and other effects; typical food-use levels are much lower than medicinal doses.[^4]

## Does Magnesium citrate have any benefits?
It can act as a permitted mineral source of magnesium in EU food supplements and certain fortified foods, helping contribute to magnesium intake where allowed.[^6] If you’re choosing a supplement, follow the label and your healthcare provider’s advice, and check which magnesium form it uses.

## Who should avoid Magnesium citrate?
People with kidney problems or anyone on a magnesium-restricted diet should be cautious with magnesium from supplements and laxatives and read labels closely.[^4][^5] If you’re sensitive to magnesium-containing laxatives, choose foods and drinks without added magnesium salts and talk with your clinician about your total intake.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E 345 is banned.” Fact: Magnesium citrates (E 345) are authorized as food additives in the EU and included in the Union list with specifications.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “Any amount of magnesium citrate in food works like a laxative.” Fact: Laxative use involves medicinal dosing; food uses are for acidity control and are much smaller.[^5][^1]
- Myth: “An E-number means the additive is artificial and unsafe.” Fact: An E-number simply shows the additive is evaluated and approved in the EU, and magnesium citrates have defined food-grade specifications.[^7][^2]

## Magnesium citrate in Branded Foods
You’ll see it most in mainstream sodas and sports drinks, some candies and gummies, and fruit preparations where tartness and pH control matter. It can also appear in EU food supplements as a listed magnesium source.

## FAQ — Top 5 questions
Q: What is E 345?  
A: E 345 refers to magnesium citrates, the magnesium salts of citric acid used as food additives, mainly to regulate acidity in foods and drinks.[^1][^2]

Q: Is magnesium citrate in food the same as the laxative?  
A: It’s the same compound family, but foods use much smaller amounts for flavor and stability, while laxatives use medicinal doses to produce a bowel movement.[^5]

Q: How will it appear on the label?  
A: In the EU it can appear as “magnesium citrates” or “E 345,” listed with its function like “acidity regulator.”[^3]

Q: Can it add magnesium to my diet?  
A: In the EU, magnesium citrate is an approved mineral source for supplements and certain fortified foods; check your product’s nutrition label to see how much magnesium it provides.[^6]

Q: Is it allowed in many foods?  
A: Yes, the EU Union list authorizes E 345 in various categories, often at “quantum satis” (use only as much as needed for the effect).[^1]
