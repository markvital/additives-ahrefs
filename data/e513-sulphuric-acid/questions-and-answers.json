      "q": "is h2so4 a strong acid",
      "a": "Yes—sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong diprotic acid; its first proton dissociates completely in water.",

      "q": "what is sulfuric acid used for",
      "a": "As a food additive (E513), it’s used as an acidity regulator and processing aid for pH control, sugar refining, and starch modification; industrially it’s used for fertilizers, batteries, and chemical synthesis.",

    {
      "q": "what does h2so4 do in a reaction",
      "a": "It donates protons to acidify mixtures and can catalyze hydrolysis, esterification, and dehydration; in food processing it’s mainly used to adjust pH and is neutralized or removed afterward.",
