      "q": "is h2so4 a strong acid",
      "a": "Yes—sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a very strong, diprotic mineral acid in water; its first proton dissociates completely (the second is weaker), and it is highly corrosive.",

      "q": "what is sulfuric acid used for",
      "a": "As the food additive E513, it’s used to control pH and as a processing aid in sugar refining and starch hydrolysis; more broadly it’s used in fertilizer production, chemical manufacturing, and lead-acid batteries.",

      "q": "is sulfuric acid a strong acid",
      "a": "Yes; it is considered a strong acid in water, with the first dissociation essentially complete.",

    {
      "q": "what does h2so4 do in a reaction",
      "a": "It donates protons (H+) to lower pH and neutralize bases, forming sulfate salts; at high concentration it also acts as a dehydrating agent and acid catalyst (e.g., for esterification or hydrolysis).",
