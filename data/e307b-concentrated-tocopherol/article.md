Concentrated tocopherol (E307b) is a form of vitamin E used as an antioxidant in foods. It helps keep oils and fats from going rancid, protecting flavor, color, and nutrients during storage.

## At a glance
- What it is: A concentrated mix of tocopherols (vitamin E compounds) used as an antioxidant.
- What it does: Slows oxidation in fats and oils, helping food keep its taste and shelf life.
- Where it comes from: Usually purified from vegetable oils like soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed.
- How it appears on labels: “Concentrated tocopherol,” “mixed tocopherols,” “antioxidant (E307b),” or “tocopherols.”
- Common in: Vegetable oils, margarines and spreads, roasted nuts, snacks, cereal products, and dressings.
- Related additives: [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), [gamma-tocopherol](/e308-gamme-tocopherol), [delta-tocopherol](/e309-delta-tocopherol).

## Why is concentrated tocopherol added to food?
Food fats go stale when oxygen breaks them down. Concentrated tocopherol interrupts this process, so foods keep their flavor and do not develop off-odors as quickly.[^1]

## What foods contain concentrated tocopherol?
You will most often find it in foods that are rich in oils or delicate fats:
- Bottled vegetable oils and culinary sprays
- Margarines and plant-based spreads
- Roasted nuts and nut butters
- Baked goods, cereals, and granola
- Snack foods such as chips and crackers
- Salad dressings and mayonnaise

On ingredient lists, look for “tocopherols,” “mixed tocopherols,” or “E307b.”

## What can replace concentrated tocopherol?
Manufacturers choose from different antioxidant systems depending on the food:
- Natural antioxidants: [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary), [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), and [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate)
- Synthetic antioxidants: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), and [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Process helpers: Packaging that limits oxygen, or adding chelators like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

## How is concentrated tocopherol made?
Concentrated tocopherol is typically obtained from deodorizer distillates or other fractions of edible vegetable oils. These fractions are purified and concentrated by distillation and other refining steps to yield a mixture rich in tocopherol isomers (alpha, beta, gamma, delta).[^2] In the European Union, specifications for identity and purity are set in law, including limits for contaminants and the requirement that the material is derived from vegetable oils.[^3]

## Is concentrated tocopherol safe to eat?
Regulators consider tocopherols safe when used as antioxidants in foods. In the United States, tocopherols are “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) for this purpose.[^1] In the European Union, EFSA re-evaluated tocopherols used as food additives and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels.[^2]

Keep in mind that vitamin E also comes from supplements. Very high supplemental intakes can have side effects, so established upper limits apply to total daily intake from supplements and fortified foods.[^4]

## Does concentrated tocopherol have any benefits?
For food quality, it helps protect oils and oil-rich foods from oxidation, which supports flavor, color, and shelf life.[^1] As a nutrient, tocopherol is vitamin E, a fat-soluble compound that helps protect cells from oxidative damage. However, the small amounts used as an additive are mainly for food protection, not to meet your daily vitamin E needs.[^4]

## Who should avoid concentrated tocopherol?
- People taking anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders should be cautious with high-dose vitamin E supplements because of an increased risk of bleeding; this is not typically an issue from normal amounts used in foods.[^4]
- If you have severe allergies and want to know the botanical source (for example, soybean), check with the manufacturer. Tocopherols are highly refined, but companies can tell you the source oil if needed.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Tocopherols are preservatives that kill germs.” Fact: Tocopherols are antioxidants; they slow oxidation of fats. They are not antimicrobials.
- Myth: “E307b means synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Concentrated tocopherol is normally derived from vegetable oils and refined for purity.[^3]
- Myth: “If a food has tocopherols, it provides a big dose of vitamin E.” Fact: Additive levels are chosen to protect the food, not to supply large amounts of the vitamin.[^4]
- Myth: “All tocopherols are the same.” Fact: Alpha, beta, gamma, and delta forms exist; food-grade concentrates contain a mix tuned to the application.[^2]

## concentrated tocopherol in branded foods
On packages, look for “tocopherols,” “mixed tocopherols,” “concentrated tocopherol,” or “antioxidant (E307b).” It is common in shelf-stable oils and spreads, roasted nut products, ready-to-eat cereals and granola, and many salty snacks. The exact form and amount vary by brand and recipe.
