Monopotassium tartrate (E336i), better known as cream of tartar, is a food acid and stabilizer widely used in baking and candy making. It helps batters rise, keeps egg whites fluffy, and stops syrups from crystallizing.

## At a glance
- Also called cream of tartar, potassium bitartrate, and potassium hydrogen tartrate
- Roles in food: acidity regulator, leavening acid, and foam/syrup stabilizer
- Common in baking powders, meringues, candies, and some beverages
- Known in the EU as E336(i); recognized in the U.S. as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
- Neutral, clean flavor with a tart taste; works well with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) in recipes

## Why is Monopotassium tartrate added to food?
It is added to adjust acidity, make baking powders work, and stabilize foams and syrups. In baking, it provides the “acid” half of a leavening system together with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate), releasing carbon dioxide to lift doughs and batters. It also helps egg whites whip to a higher, more stable foam and keeps sugar syrups smooth in candies and frostings. In the EU, it is listed as E336(i) with defined identity and purity specifications.[^1]

## What foods contain Monopotassium tartrate?
You will most often see it in:
- Baking powders and self-rising flours (as a leavening acid, paired with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate))
- Meringues and angel food cakes (to stabilize whipped egg whites)
- Caramels, fondants, and frostings (to help prevent sugar crystallization)
- Some flavored drinks and syrups (as a mild acidity regulator)

On labels it may appear as “cream of tartar,” “potassium bitartrate,” “potassium hydrogen tartrate,” or “E336i” (in the EU).

## What can replace Monopotassium tartrate?
Depending on the recipe and role, cooks and manufacturers may use:
- Other leavening acids in baking powder: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) or [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate); some formulas use [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate)
- Other food acids for acidity or syrup work: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), or [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone)

Note that substitutions can change taste, speed of gas release, and texture, so formulas may need adjustment.

## How is Monopotassium tartrate made?
Monopotassium tartrate is the potassium acid salt of L(+)-tartaric acid. Food-grade material must meet official identity and purity criteria set in EU specifications (Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012), such as assay and maximum levels for certain impurities.[^1]

## Is Monopotassium tartrate safe to eat?
Regulators consider it safe when used as intended. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated tartaric acid and its potassium salts and did not identify safety concerns at current authorized uses and levels.[^2] In the United States, cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) appears on the FDA Food Additive Status List as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for its typical uses.[^3]

## Does Monopotassium tartrate have any benefits?
- Baking performance: reliable leavening when paired with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate), giving lighter texture
- Foam stability: helps whipped egg whites hold volume and fine structure
- Candy making: supports smooth, non-grainy syrups and confections
- Flavor control: provides gentle tartness without strong off-notes

## Who should avoid Monopotassium tartrate?
People who must limit potassium intake—such as some individuals with chronic kidney disease or those told by their clinician to follow a low‑potassium diet—should monitor sources of potassium salts, including cream of tartar.[^4] If you have a kidney condition or take potassium‑sparing medicines, ask your healthcare provider before using large amounts in home recipes.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Cream of tartar is dairy.” Fact: Despite its name, it contains no cream or dairy; it is a potassium salt.
- Myth: “All baking powders contain aluminum.” Fact: Cream‑of‑tartar‑based baking powders are aluminum‑free; some other formulas use aluminum salts like [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate).
- Myth: “It’s only for baking.” Fact: It is also useful in candies, syrups, and some beverages as a stabilizer and mild acid.

## Monopotassium tartrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “cream of tartar,” “potassium bitartrate,” “potassium hydrogen tartrate,” or “E336i.” It commonly appears in:
- Baking powders and mixes
- Meringue powders and macaron mixes
- Confectionery and icing sugar blends
- Some beverage bases and syrups
