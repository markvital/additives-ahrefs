      "q": "what is a linear function",
      "a": "For E1204 Pullulan, “linear” describes its mostly linear polymer chain—maltotriose units linked α‑1,6 with internal α‑1,4—while its function in foods is as a film-former and thickener, not a mathematical function.",

    {
      "q": "what is a linear foot",
      "a": "A linear foot is a length measure and isn’t relevant to E1204; pullulan is supplied and used by weight for its film-forming and thickening properties.",

    {
      "q": "which table represents a linear function?",
      "a": "That math question doesn’t apply to E1204; for pullulan, you’d consult technical data sheets showing composition, molecular weight, and viscosity versus concentration.",

    {
      "q": "what is a linear equation",
      "a": "In the context of pullulan, “linear” refers to the polymer’s chain architecture, not an equation; E1204 is a film-forming, thickening polysaccharide used in edible films and coatings.",

    {
      "q": "what is linear regression",
      "a": "Linear regression is a statistical method and doesn’t pertain to E1204; for pullulan the relevant information is its role as a film-former and thickener used in edible films, capsules, and coatings.",
