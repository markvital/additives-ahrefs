Pullulan (E1204) is a natural polysaccharide made by fermentation. In food, it is used mainly as a film-former and thickener, creating clear, flexible coatings and quick-dissolving sheets. You’ll most often see it in edible glazes, confectionery, and breath-freshening strips.

## At a glance
- What it is: A fermentation-derived carbohydrate (polysaccharide) made by the microbe Aureobasidium pullulans.
- What it does: Works as a film-former and thickener; makes clear, tasteless, flexible edible films and glazes that dissolve quickly in the mouth.
- Where it shows up: Breath strips, candy coatings and glazes, edible films, and some flavor or sweetener delivery sheets.
- Dietary notes: Not animal-derived; generally compatible with vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Why is Pullulan added to food?
Pullulan is added because it forms strong, transparent, and tasteless edible films that carry flavors, sweeteners, or colors and can protect foods as a thin glaze. These films can help limit contact with oxygen and moisture, which supports freshness and texture in items like candies and coated snacks.[^1]

## What foods contain Pullulan?
You are most likely to find pullulan in:
- Breath-freshening or mouth-dissolving strips
- Glazes and coatings for confectionery and snack items
- Edible films used to carry flavors, colors, or sweeteners
- Some dissolvable sheets used in beverages or instant mixes

On labels, it may appear as “pullulan” or “E1204.”

## What can replace Pullulan?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- For thickening or stabilizing: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- For gel-like texture or fruit applications: [pectins](/e440-pectins) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- For glossy coatings: [shellac](/e904-shellac) or [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)

Each substitute has its own texture, clarity, and flavor profile, so results will vary.

## How is Pullulan made?
Manufacturers produce pullulan by fermenting sugars (often from starch) with a non-pathogenic fungus called Aureobasidium pullulans. After fermentation, the polymer is purified—typically by filtering the broth, removing proteins and color, precipitating the polymer (for example with alcohol), and drying—so it meets strict identity and purity specifications.[^2] Structurally, pullulan is an alpha-D-glucan made mainly of repeating maltotriose units linked in a way that gives it excellent film-forming properties.[^2][^3]

## Is Pullulan safe to eat?
EU risk assessors have evaluated pullulan and concluded it does not raise safety concerns at the approved uses and use levels in food.[^1] In the EU, pullulan also has official composition and purity criteria (such as limits for contaminants) that manufacturers must meet before it can be sold as a food additive.[^2]

## Does Pullulan have any benefits?
From a food-making point of view, pullulan’s benefits are practical: it is neutral in taste, forms clear and flexible films, dissolves quickly, and can help protect delicate flavors. It lets makers deliver flavor or sweetener in thin sheets and add a clean glaze without waxy taste.

## Who should avoid Pullulan?
Most people do not need to avoid pullulan. If you find that fermentable carbohydrates (for example, some gums and fibers) cause digestive discomfort, start with small amounts and see how you feel. People on medically supervised diets (such as low-FODMAP plans) should check labels and follow their clinician’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Pullulan is plastic.” Fact: It’s a carbohydrate made by fermentation, not a petroleum-derived plastic.
- Myth: “It comes from animals.” Fact: Pullulan is produced by a microbe and is not animal-derived.
- Myth: “It’s the same as gelatin.” Fact: Gelatin is an animal protein; pullulan is a microbial polysaccharide and behaves differently in recipes. See [gelatine](/e428-gelatine).

## Pullulan in branded foods
You may see E1204 listed on:
- Breath-freshening strips and other mouth-dissolving films
- Coated or glazed candies and chocolate items
- Edible films and sheets used to deliver flavors or colors
- Some instant beverage sheets or dissolvable flavor carriers
