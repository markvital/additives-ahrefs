Paraffin wax (E905CII) is a food-grade mixture of solid hydrocarbons refined from petroleum. It is mainly used as a protective, glossy coating and as a component of chewing gum base, helping foods keep moisture and resist sticking. It is closely related to microcrystalline wax and other approved food waxes.

## At a glance
- What it is: A purified petroleum-derived wax used in tiny amounts on foods.
- What it does: Adds shine, reduces moisture loss, and helps prevent sticking during processing.
- Where it’s found: Fresh produce coatings, confectionery glazes, and chewing gum base.
- Also known as: E905c(ii), food-grade paraffin wax.
- Related waxes: [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax), [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax), [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil), [petroleum jelly](/e905b-petroleum-jelly), [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), [shellac](/e904-shellac), [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), [rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax).

## Why is Paraffin wax added to food?
Paraffin wax forms a thin, clear coating that keeps moisture in, reduces scuffing, and improves shine on foods like fruits and candies. It also helps stop products from sticking to machinery or to each other during production and shipping. In gum, it contributes to the texture and elasticity of the gum base.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Paraffin wax?
You might find paraffin wax:
- As a protective coating on some fresh fruits and vegetables sold at retail.[^4]
- In the base of chewing gum, where it helps bind and soften the gum.[^2]
- As part of approved glazing or surface-treatment systems used on certain confectionery or similar foods, where permitted by local rules.[^1][^3]

## What can replace Paraffin wax?
Common substitutes include plant and insect waxes such as:
- [Carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) and [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) for high-gloss coatings.
- [White and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) or [shellac](/e904-shellac) for protective finishes.
- [Rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax) in some confectionery glazes.
- [Microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax) when a similar petroleum-derived wax with different crystal structure is needed.

The best replacement depends on the target gloss, melt point, label preferences (plant vs. petroleum origin), and local regulations.

## How is Paraffin wax made?
Food-grade paraffin wax is obtained by refining specific petroleum fractions to isolate solid, saturated hydrocarbons. The material is then further purified to meet strict identity and purity criteria before it can be used on or in food.[^1][^3]

## Is Paraffin wax safe to eat?
In the United States, petroleum waxes (which include paraffin wax) may be safely used on or in foods when they meet specifications and are used as described in regulation, such as for coatings on fresh produce and as part of chewing gum base.[^1][^2] In the European Union, E 905 waxes are authorized food additives with detailed specifications set in law.[^3] FDA consumer guidance also recognizes the approved use of food-grade wax coatings on produce sold in stores.[^4]

## Does Paraffin wax have any benefits?
Paraffin wax helps keep fruits and similar foods from drying out, which can maintain quality during storage and shipping. It also improves surface appearance and reduces scuffing on coated items. In manufacturing, it can reduce sticking, which supports consistent product quality and efficient processing.[^1][^4]

## Who should avoid Paraffin wax?
- People who prefer to avoid petroleum-derived ingredients for personal or dietary reasons.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to avoid certain coatings or processing aids.
- If you have a known sensitivity to wax-coated products, choose unwaxed options when available.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Wax coatings seal in pesticides.” Fact: Coatings are applied after washing and are used in very small amounts to reduce moisture loss and improve appearance.
- Myth: “Wax on fruit is the same as candle wax.” Fact: Food-grade paraffin wax must meet strict purity standards different from household candles.
- Myth: “Waxed produce isn’t safe.” Fact: Food-grade coatings are regulated and permitted for use on fresh fruits and vegetables.[^1][^4]

## Paraffin wax in branded foods
You may see paraffin wax listed as “paraffin wax,” “petroleum wax,” or by its E-number (E905c or E905CII) on ingredient lists where labeling is required. It often appears on produce labels or on confectionery and gum packages that use glazing agents. Not every brand uses wax coatings, and some prefer plant-based alternatives like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax).
