      "q": "is paraffin wax toxic",
      "a": "Food-grade paraffin wax (E905CII) is not considered toxic at permitted food-use levels; it’s poorly absorbed and largely inert, though large amounts may cause laxative effects or discomfort. Food standards require it to meet purity specs that limit contaminants like PAHs.",

      "q": "is paraffin wax edible",
      "a": "Yes—when food-grade, it’s permitted as a surface coating/glazing agent and in chewing gum, but it isn’t digestible or nutritious, so only small incidental amounts should be consumed.",

      "q": "what does paraffin wax do",
      "a": "In foods it serves as a glazing and moisture barrier, giving shine, reducing stickiness, and protecting surfaces on items like confectionery, fruits, and cheese; it’s also used as a release agent and in gum base.",

      "q": "what does paraffin wax do for feet",
      "a": "Warm paraffin baths soften and moisturize the skin and the heat can provide temporary relief of stiffness in joints. Use appropriate-grade wax at safe temperatures to avoid burns, especially if you have circulation or sensation issues.",
