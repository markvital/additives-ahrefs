Fatty acid methyl ester (E911) is a family of waxy, oil-like substances made from natural fats and oils. In food, it is mainly used as a surface treatment to keep products from sticking, scuffing, or losing moisture, depending on local regulations. It may also be called FAME, which stands for fatty acid methyl esters.

## At a glance

- What it is: A mixture of methyl esters made from common fatty acids (for example, from vegetable oils).
- What it does: Acts as a glazing or release agent to reduce stickiness and scuffing on surfaces.
- Where found: Surface-treated foods in some markets; use depends on local laws and product type.
- Dietary notes: Source oils can be plant or animal; ask manufacturers if you need a specific origin.

## Why is Fatty acid methyl ester added to food?

Manufacturers use E911 to create a very thin, hydrophobic (water-repelling) film on the surface of foods. This film helps:
- Reduce stickiness and scuffing during packaging and transport
- Limit moisture loss from delicate surfaces
- Improve shine and appearance

In other words, it is primarily a processing and finishing aid for surface quality, not a flavoring.

## What foods contain Fatty acid methyl ester?

When permitted, E911 appears on foods that benefit from a protective finish or better release from molds or conveyors. Examples may include:
- Certain confectionery pieces and dragees
- Some fresh produce and nuts with a surface treatment
- Coffee beans or similar glossy products

Actual use varies by country and by product type. Always check the ingredient list for “E911” or “fatty acid methyl ester.”

## What can replace Fatty acid methyl ester?

Food makers often choose among several glazing or release agents based on the food, processing line, and local rules. Common alternatives include:
- Natural waxes such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), and [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax)
- Resin-based coatings like [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- Petroleum-derived waxes such as [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax) or [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil)
- Related surface agents like [wax ester](/e910-wax-ester) or [montanic acid esters](/e912-montanic-acid-esters)
- Process aids for foam control on lines, such as [dimethylpolysiloxane](/e900-dimethylpolysiloxane-and-methylphenylpolysiloxane) in relevant applications

The best choice depends on required gloss, hardness, melting point, label preferences, and regulatory status.

## How is Fatty acid methyl ester made?

E911 is typically produced by reacting natural fats and oils with methanol in a process called transesterification. This reaction converts the triglycerides in the oil into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and glycerin, using a catalyst and controlled conditions.[^1]

## Is Fatty acid methyl ester safe to eat?

In the United States, food additives are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which evaluates safety and sets conditions for use or recognizes certain uses as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Whether and how E911 can be used depends on the specific regulation or GRAS status that applies to the intended use and level.[^2] In the European Union, risk assessment is performed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and detailed specifications and permitted uses for food additives are established in EU legislation.[^3][^4]

Only food-grade material that meets applicable purity specifications should be used in foods. As with all additives, actual approvals, categories, and limits depend on local law and the specific product.

## Does Fatty acid methyl ester have any benefits?

Technological benefits include:
- Better release from molds, belts, and wrappers
- Improved resistance to scratching and sticking during transport
- A controlled surface sheen
- Potentially reduced moisture loss from delicate surfaces

These are processing and quality advantages; E911 does not contribute meaningful flavor or nutrition.

## Who should avoid Fatty acid methyl ester?

- People with strict dietary requirements (vegan, vegetarian, religious) may wish to confirm the source of the fats, as E911 can be made from plant or animal oils. Manufacturers can provide the origin.
- Individuals with very specific sensitivities can consult the maker for full additive specifications. Highly refined source oils typically contain negligible protein, but source disclosure may still matter for personal or ethical reasons.

If you have a medical condition or allergy that requires avoiding certain source materials, check with the producer or your healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts

- “It’s used in biodiesel, so it must be a fuel.” Fact: The same chemistry that makes FAME is used for biodiesel, but food-grade E911 is made to different purity standards for food use.
- “It’s a preservative.” Myth: E911 is not used to extend shelf life through antimicrobial action; it is a surface treatment and release agent.
- “It changes the taste.” Mostly false: When used correctly as a surface agent, it is not intended to alter flavor.

## Fatty acid methyl ester in branded foods

You may see E911 on labels for coated or polished items where a thin, protective finish is desirable. Look for the terms “E911,” “fatty acid methyl ester,” or simply “glazing agent,” depending on local labeling rules. Availability and labeling vary by market and brand.
