Distearyl thiodipropionate (E390) is a fat‑soluble antioxidant used to slow the oxidation of fats and oils and keep foods from going rancid. It is authorised as a food additive in the European Union under specific purity rules, while in the United States it is used mainly in food‑contact plastics rather than added directly to foods.

## At a glance
- Role: antioxidant that helps protect fats and oils from turning rancid
- Where it’s allowed: authorised in the EU with specifications; used in food‑contact materials in the U.S.
- Label names: “E390” or “distearyl thiodipropionate”
- Often paired with other antioxidants such as [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)

## Why is Distearyl thiodipropionate added to food?
Manufacturers add E390 to help prevent oxidation, a reaction that causes off‑flavors, odors, and color changes in fat‑rich foods. In the EU, it is listed as an antioxidant food additive with established identity and purity criteria, which confirms its technological function in foods.[^1] When used, it is often combined with primary antioxidants like [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or natural [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) to bolster overall stability.

## What foods contain Distearyl thiodipropionate?
Authorised uses and maximum levels for food additives in the EU are set out in the Union list; E390 appears on that list, meaning it may be used only in specified food categories and under stated conditions.[^2] On labels, look for “E390” or “distearyl thiodipropionate.” In the U.S., you are unlikely to find it listed as an ingredient because it is cleared primarily for use in certain food‑contact plastics rather than as a direct additive.[^3]

## What can replace Distearyl thiodipropionate?
- Synthetic antioxidants: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), and [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate)
- Natural‑origin options: [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), and [rosemary extracts](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Related thiodipropionate: [dilauryl thiodipropionate](/e389-dilauryl-thiodipropionate)

The best substitute depends on the food, its fat content, and the desired shelf life.

## How is Distearyl thiodipropionate made?
E390 is the diester of 3,3′‑thiodipropionic acid and stearyl alcohol. It is produced by esterification, a process that chemically links the acid to the C18 stearyl alcohol to form a fat‑soluble antioxidant meeting EU purity specifications.[^1]

## Is Distearyl thiodipropionate safe to eat?
In the EU, E390 is authorised and must meet identity and purity criteria, which implies a safety evaluation and restrictions on where and how much may be used.[^1][^2] In the U.S., distearyl thiodipropionate is cleared as an antioxidant/stabiliser in certain food‑contact polymers but is not generally approved as a direct food ingredient; this limits consumer exposure to any potential dietary intake from migration under regulated conditions.[^3]

## Does Distearyl thiodipropionate have any benefits?
Yes. Technologically, it helps keep fats fresher for longer by slowing oxidation, which can preserve flavor, aroma, and color in fat‑rich foods. This can reduce food waste and maintain quality during storage when it is permitted and appropriately used.[^2]

## Who should avoid Distearyl thiodipropionate?
- Consumers who prefer to avoid synthetic antioxidants may choose alternatives such as [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary).
- If you are following dietary guidance that limits food additives for infants and very young children, check local rules and product labels, since allowable additives and levels can be more restrictive in those categories.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E390 is a sulfite.” Fact: It is a thioester antioxidant, not a sulfite preservative.
- Myth: “It’s widely used in U.S. foods.” Fact: In the U.S., it is authorised for use in certain food‑contact plastics rather than as a direct food additive.[^3]
- Myth: “All antioxidants are the same.” Fact: Different antioxidants act in different ways and are chosen based on the food matrix; E390 is typically used for fat‑rich systems.[^2]

## Distearyl thiodipropionate in branded foods
You will most often see E390 listed as “distearyl thiodipropionate” or “E390” on EU ingredient lists when it is used. If you do not see it named, the product likely relies on other antioxidants such as [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), or [rosemary extracts](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary). In the U.S., you’re more likely to encounter it in technical documents for packaging materials rather than on food labels.[^3]
