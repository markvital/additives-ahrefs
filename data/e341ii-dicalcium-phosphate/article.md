Dicalcium phosphate (E341ii) is a calcium phosphate salt used in foods mainly to stop powders from clumping, help doughs and batters work, and add calcium. It shows up in baking mixes, powdered drinks, and fortified foods, and is considered safe when used as intended by regulators.

## At a glance
Dicalcium phosphate is a mineral salt that helps foods keep their texture and flow.

- What it is: the calcium hydrogen phosphate salt, often written as CaHPO4, used in food-grade anhydrous or dihydrate forms.
- What it does: works as an anti-caking agent, acidity regulator, stabilizer, and sometimes as a slow leavening acid and calcium source.
- Where you’ll see it: baking powder and mixes, self-rising flour, powdered drink bases, dry dairy replacers, confectionery powders, and some fortified foods.
- How it tastes: essentially neutral; it doesn’t add a strong flavor.
- Label names: Dicalcium phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, E341ii.
- Related additives: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) (E341i) and [tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate) (E341iii).

## Why is Dicalcium phosphate added to food?
Food makers use it to keep powders free-flowing, to control acidity, to stabilize mixtures, and to supply calcium without altering taste very much.^[It is authorized in the EU as a food additive (E341ii) with functions including acidity regulation, anti-caking, stabilizing, and raising agent roles.]^1

- Anti-caking in dry mixes: helps prevent clumps in powdered sugar blends, spice mixes, drink powders, and instant desserts.^1
- Leavening support: in some baking powders, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate can react slowly with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) to release carbon dioxide during baking.^1
- Calcium fortification: adds a stable, low-flavor source of calcium to certain foods and supplements.^1
- Buffering/acidity control: helps maintain a target pH (acidity), which protects texture and flavor.^1

## What foods contain Dicalcium phosphate?
You are most likely to find it in dry, shelf-stable products where flow and texture matter.

- Baking powder, cake and pancake mixes, and self-rising flour
- Powdered drink mixes and instant tea or coffee whiteners
- Dry dairy replacers and creamers
- Confectionery powders (icing blends, fondant mixes) and chewing gum bases
- Nutritional drink powders and some fortified foods

Always check the ingredient list; it may appear as “dicalcium phosphate,” “calcium hydrogen phosphate,” or “E341ii.”

## What can replace Dicalcium phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it performs in your recipe or product.

- Anti-caking: [tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate), [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate)
- Leavening acid: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate), [glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) in some applications
- Calcium fortification: [calcium citrate](/e333-calcium-citrates), [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate), [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate)

## How is Dicalcium phosphate made?
In food manufacturing, it is produced by reacting a purified phosphate source with a calcium source, then filtering and drying to meet strict identity and purity standards.^[EFSA’s re-evaluation describes calcium phosphates being produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid with calcium salts, with specifications set for food-grade materials.]^1 ^[EU Regulation 231/2012 sets identity and purity specifications for E341, including dicalcium phosphate.]^2

## Is Dicalcium phosphate safe to eat?
Regulators in the European Union authorize E341ii for use in foods, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for all phosphate additives of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus (P), from all dietary sources.^[EFSA 2019; ADI of 40 mg P/kg bw/day for phosphates E338–341, E343, E450–452.]^1 This ADI covers total phosphates in the diet, not just one additive.^1

Phosphate from additives is readily absorbed, so total phosphorus intake can add up, especially in diets high in processed foods.^[NIH Office of Dietary Supplements notes that phosphorus from phosphate additives is readily absorbed compared with natural food phosphorus.]^3 Within approved uses and good manufacturing practice, dicalcium phosphate itself is considered safe for the general population.^1

## Does Dicalcium phosphate have any benefits?
Its main “benefit” is technological: it keeps powders free-flowing and helps batters and doughs perform predictably.^1 It can also contribute calcium, which is an essential mineral, though the overall health effect depends on your full diet and total phosphorus and calcium intakes.^[NIH ODS provides background on phosphorus and calcium balance and absorption from foods and additives.]^3

## Who should avoid Dicalcium phosphate?
Most people don’t need to avoid it, but some should pay closer attention.

- People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or on phosphorus-restricted diets may be advised to limit phosphate additives, including E341ii, because their bodies may have trouble clearing excess phosphorus.^[NIH ODS advises that people with kidney disease may need to limit phosphorus, including phosphate additives.]^3
- Children with high intake of processed foods may approach or exceed the phosphate ADI; families can manage this by choosing fewer phosphate-additive foods and reading labels.^[EFSA estimated that high consumers among infants, toddlers, and children could exceed the group ADI for phosphates.]^1

If you have kidney disease or a mineral imbalance, talk with your healthcare provider or dietitian about phosphorus from both foods and additives.^3

## Myths & facts
A few quick clarifications help put this additive in context.

- Myth: “Dicalcium phosphate is just filler.” Fact: It has clear functions—anti-caking, buffering, and sometimes leavening—so it improves quality and consistency in specific foods.^1
- Myth: “All phosphate additives act the same.” Fact: Different phosphates behave differently; for example, [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate) is fast-acting in baking, while dicalcium phosphate is slower and is often used for flow and texture.^1
- Myth: “It always adds a chalky taste.” Fact: At food-use levels, it is essentially neutral in flavor and is chosen because it doesn’t strongly affect taste.^2

## Dicalcium phosphate in branded foods
Formulas change often, so the sure way to know is to read the label. Look for “dicalcium phosphate,” “calcium hydrogen phosphate,” or “E341ii” on:

- Baking powders and self-rising flour
- Cake, pancake, and biscuit mixes
- Instant drink mixes and powdered creamers
- Dry confectionery and gum bases
- Fortified nutrition powders
