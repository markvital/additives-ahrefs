Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate (E436), also called Polysorbate 65, is a food emulsifier and stabiliser. It helps oil and water mix, keeping sauces, desserts, and mixes smooth and uniform. It has been approved for use in many countries when used within set limits.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier and stabiliser that helps oil and water stay mixed
- Also called: Polysorbate 65, E436
- Common uses: bakery mixes, dessert mixes, icings, and whipped toppings
- How it works: gives smoother texture, prevents separation, and can improve foam and air incorporation
- How it’s made: from sorbitan (from sorbitol), stearic acid, and ethylene oxide
- Safety: permitted in the U.S. and EU with purity rules and use limits
- Label check: look for “polysorbate 65” or “E436”

## Why is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate added to food?
Manufacturers use E436 to keep oil and water mixed and stable. In simple terms, it sits at the boundary of oil and water and helps them play nicely together. This gives foods a smoother bite and more even texture. It can also help whipped toppings and similar products hold air and stay fluffy longer.

## What foods contain Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate?
You may find E436 in certain baked goods and mixes, dessert mixes, icings, and whipped toppings. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists specific food categories where polysorbate 65 is allowed, with set limits for each use in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).[^1]

## What can replace Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate?
Depending on the recipe and label needs, common substitutes include:
- Other polysorbates such as [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate) or [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate)
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) from soy or sunflower
- [Sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- [Polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for some chocolate and confectionery systems
- Hydrocolloids that help stabilize emulsions, such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)

## How is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate made?
Polysorbate 65 is made in steps. First, sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) is turned into sorbitan, which is then esterified with stearic acid to form sorbitan tristearate. Next, ethylene oxide is added to give the “polyoxyethylene” chains. The result is polyoxyethylene (about 20 units) sorbitan tristearate, made to meet strict purity specifications in the EU additive rulebook.[^2]

## Is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate safe to eat?
E436 is authorized for use in the U.S. and the European Union when it meets purity specs and is used within legal limits. In the U.S., the FDA lists allowed food uses for polysorbate 65 in the CFR.[^1] In the EU, food additives are controlled under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, and specifications are set in companion rules.[^3] As with any additive, safety depends on following these rules.

Note: ADI stands for Acceptable Daily Intake. It is a health-based guideline set by expert bodies to show the amount of a substance that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable risk.

## Does Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate have any benefits?
Functionally, E436 helps products stay uniform and appealing. It can:
- Keep oil and water from separating
- Improve foam and air retention in whipped products
- Give smoother, creamier textures
- Help products stay consistent during shelf life

These benefits often let bakers and formulators get stable results with less batch-to-batch variability.

## Who should avoid Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate?
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit emulsifiers should follow that guidance and check labels.
- If you prefer to avoid certain additives for personal or dietary reasons, look for “polysorbate 65” or “E436” on the ingredient list.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Polysorbates are all the same.”  
  Fact: There are several polysorbates (E432–E436). They differ by the fatty acid attached, which leads to different performance in foods. Official specifications list each one separately.[^2]

- Myth: “E-numbers mean an ingredient is unsafe.”  
  Fact: An E-number is simply the EU’s code for an approved food additive. Authorization and conditions of use are laid out in EU law.[^3]

- Myth: “Polysorbate 65 is a single simple chemical.”  
  Fact: It is a defined mixture made by reacting sorbitan tristearate with ethylene oxide to add polyoxyethylene chains, and it has to meet set purity specifications.[^2]

## Polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate in branded foods
On labels, look for “polysorbate 65,” “polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate,” or “E436.” It appears in select bakery products, dessert mixes, icings, and whipped toppings. Ingredient lists change often, so the most reliable way to check a specific brand is to read the package or contact the manufacturer.
