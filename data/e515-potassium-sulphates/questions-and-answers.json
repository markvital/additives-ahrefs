      "q": "how much potassium is in glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride",
      "a": "In the common “glucosamine sulfate 2KCl” form, potassium is about 13% by weight—so 1500 mg of the salt provides roughly 190–200 mg of potassium; check your product’s label for the exact amount.",

      "q": "how to use potassium sulfate fertilizer",
      "a": "Apply according to a soil test, as potassium sulfate supplies about 50% K2O and 17–18% sulfur; it can be broadcast and incorporated, side‑dressed, or fertigated and is preferred where chloride must be limited. Always follow local agronomic guidance and the product label to avoid overapplication.",
