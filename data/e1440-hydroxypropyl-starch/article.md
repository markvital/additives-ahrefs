Hydroxypropyl starch (E1440) is a “modified” starch made by attaching small hydroxypropyl groups to the starch molecules from plants like corn, potato, or tapioca. It works as a thickener and stabiliser that helps sauces, fillings, and frozen foods stay smooth instead of separating or turning grainy. It is authorised for use in the EU and permitted in the U.S. when it meets official specifications.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant starch that has been gently altered to improve stability and texture  
- What it does: thickens, stabilises, and helps emulsify mixtures that might otherwise separate  
- Where it’s found: soups, sauces, gravies, dairy desserts, pie fillings, dressings, and some ready meals  
- On labels: “hydroxypropyl starch,” “modified starch,” or “E1440” (EU)  
- Related additives: [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch), [acetylated starch](/e1420-acetylated-starch), [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate)  

## Why is Hydroxypropyl starch added to food?
Manufacturers use hydroxypropyl starch to make foods thicker, smoother, and more stable during heating, cooling, and freezing. It reduces “syneresis,” which is when water leaks out of gels and fillings, and helps sauces resist breaking during cooking or storage.[^2]

## What foods contain Hydroxypropyl starch?
You may find E1440 in:
- Canned and instant soups, sauces, and gravies
- Pie fillings, fruit preparations, and puddings
- Spoonable and drinkable dairy or plant-based desserts
- Dressings and condiments that need to stay uniform
- Ready-to-heat meals and frozen foods that go through freeze–thaw cycles

Ingredient lists may show “hydroxypropyl starch,” “modified starch,” or “E1440” depending on the market.

## What can replace Hydroxypropyl starch?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- Other modified starches with similar roles, such as [acetylated starch](/e1420-acetylated-starch), [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate), or [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate)
- Traditional hydrocolloids like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [pectins](/e440-pectins)

Choice of substitute depends on desired texture, clarity, freeze–thaw stability, and processing conditions.

## How is Hydroxypropyl starch made?
Food-grade starch from sources such as corn, potato, or tapioca is reacted with propylene oxide, which attaches hydroxypropyl groups to the starch chain. After reaction, the product is neutralised, washed, and dried to meet strict specifications before use in food.[^1][^2]

## Is Hydroxypropyl starch safe to eat?
In the U.S., hydroxypropyl starch falls under “food starch-modified,” which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits when produced according to the conditions in 21 CFR 172.892.[^1] International evaluations (JECFA, a joint FAO/WHO committee) have concluded that modified starches, including hydroxypropyl starch, do not raise safety concerns at typical use levels and assigned them an “ADI not specified,” reflecting low toxicity under good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Does Hydroxypropyl starch have any benefits?
For consumers, the main benefits are better texture and consistency. E1440 helps foods stay smooth, pourable, and stable through cooking, shipping, and storage. It can also improve freeze–thaw stability in products like frozen meals and desserts. It is not added for nutrition and does not provide a special health benefit by itself.

## Who should avoid Hydroxypropyl starch?
- People with wheat allergy or celiac disease should check labels. While hydroxypropyl starch is often made from corn, potato, or tapioca, it can also be made from wheat starch; if so, “wheat” must be declared as a major allergen in the U.S.[^4]
- Individuals on medically supervised carbohydrate-restricted diets may choose to limit starch-containing additives.

If you have a known allergy or medical condition, consult your healthcare professional and verify the ingredient source with the manufacturer.

## Myths & facts
- “Modified” means GMO: False. In this context, “modified” describes physical or chemical treatment of starch (such as reaction with propylene oxide), not genetic engineering.[^1]
- It leaves harmful solvent in food: No. Manufacturing must follow legal specifications that control how hydroxypropyl starch is made and set purity requirements for the finished additive.[^2]
- All modified starches are unsafe: Not supported. Regulatory reviews allow hydroxypropyl starch in food when produced and used as specified, and international experts consider modified starches low in toxicity at normal intake levels.[^1][^3]

## Hydroxypropyl starch in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “hydroxypropyl starch,” “modified starch,” or “E1440” (EU labeling). Product categories that value smooth texture and stable thickness—like soups, sauces, dressings, fillings, and frozen meals—are the most likely places to find it. If the botanical source matters to you (for example, avoiding wheat), check the label and, when in doubt, contact the brand’s customer service for source details.
