      "q": "what is hydroxypropyl starch phosphate",
      "a": "It’s the phosphate‑crosslinked variant of hydroxypropyl starch—better known as hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (E1442)—used as a thickener/stabilizer with higher heat, acid, shear, and freeze–thaw stability than E1440.",

      "q": "how to make boba with hydroxypropyl starch",
      "a": "Blend about 70–80% tapioca starch with 20–30% hydroxypropyl starch (E1440), add 10–20% sugar, and pour in 60–70% near‑boiling water to form a smooth dough, then roll into pearls. Boil 15–25 minutes until translucent, let rest covered, and soak in syrup for chew.",

      "q": "what does sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate dp",
      "a": "It’s a phosphate‑modified form of hydroxypropyl starch used as a thickener and stabilizer; “DP” typically refers to degree of polymerization (average chain length), which affects viscosity and gel behavior.",

    {
      "q": "what is hydroxypropyl starch made of",
      "a": "It’s made by chemically modifying plant starch (often corn, potato, or tapioca) with propylene oxide to attach hydroxypropyl groups. Unlike phosphate‑crosslinked versions, E1440 is not crosslinked and mainly improves freeze–thaw stability and texture.",
