Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E219) is a paraben preservative used to slow the growth of molds and yeasts in foods and drinks. It is the sodium salt of methylparaben, which makes it more water‑soluble and easier to mix into watery foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: a paraben preservative (the sodium salt of methylparaben), also called sodium methylparaben.
- What it does: helps stop molds and yeasts, extending shelf life in water-based foods.
- Where it’s allowed: rules vary. In the European Union it is no longer authorised as a food additive. In other regions, some parabens are still permitted for certain uses.
- How it appears on labels: E219, sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sodium methylparaben.

## Why is Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
This additive is used to protect foods from spoilage by molds and yeasts, especially in products with more water, like syrups or drinks. As a salt form, it dissolves well in water, which helps it spread evenly in the product and work effectively at low levels.[^2]

Parabens have long been used as antimicrobial preservatives in foods. International expert bodies have evaluated them as part of routine food safety reviews.[^3]

## What foods contain Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Availability depends on where you live. In the European Union, E219 is not authorised in foods, so new EU products should not contain it.[^1] In other markets, parabens may still be used in some categories such as beverages, syrups, and certain desserts, depending on local rules. The Codex Alimentarius (the international food standards programme of FAO/WHO) lists potential uses for this additive under its international numbering system (INS 219); always check your local regulations and product labels.[^5]

On ingredient lists, look for “E219,” “sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate,” or “sodium methylparaben.”

## What can replace Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Food makers often choose other preservatives with similar jobs, including:
- [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) for mold and yeast control in many foods
- [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) for acidic foods and drinks
- Calcium propionate (for breads and baked goods) [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate)

If a paraben is still permitted locally, related options include [methyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e218-methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), [ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e214-ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), and their sodium salts ([E215](/e215-sodium-ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate)), subject to local laws.

## How is Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate made?
Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate is the sodium salt of methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (methylparaben). Manufacturers first make methylparaben by reacting p-hydroxybenzoic acid with methanol. The methylparaben is then neutralized with sodium hydroxide to form the water‑soluble sodium salt (E219). This identity and salt relationship are described in international additive specifications.[^3]

## Is Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
Safety depends on both dose and local rules:
- European Union: The EU removed the authorisation for parabens E214–E219 as food additives, so E219 is not permitted in EU foods.[^1]
- International evaluations: The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for certain parabens and their sodium salts, reflecting their safety at low dietary levels.[^3]
- United States: Certain parabens, including methylparaben, are permitted for specified uses in foods under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, depending on function and level.[^4]

As with any preservative, actual safety in a given product depends on following legal limits and good manufacturing practices.

## Does Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
When allowed, this preservative helps keep foods safe from spoilage by molds and yeasts, which can:
- Extend shelf life and reduce food waste
- Maintain quality in water‑rich foods and drinks[^2]

## Who should avoid Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
- People with a diagnosed paraben sensitivity or allergy should avoid products listing E219 or related parabens on the label.
- If you live in the EU, you generally won’t encounter E219 in foods because it is not authorised as a food additive.[^1]
- Parents and caregivers who prefer paraben‑free products can choose foods preserved with alternatives such as [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), where suitable.

## Myths & facts
- “All parabens are banned everywhere.” False. Rules vary by region. The EU no longer authorises E219 in food, while other jurisdictions may still allow certain parabens under specific conditions.[^1][^4]
- “Parabens and PABA are the same.” False. Parabens are esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid used as preservatives; PABA is para-aminobenzoic acid, a different compound once used in sunscreens.
- “Parabens don’t work in foods.” False. Parabens are effective against molds and yeasts and have been used as food preservatives in many countries.[^2][^5]

## Sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate in branded foods
- In the EU, you should not find E219 listed on new food labels due to its non‑authorised status.[^1]
- In other markets, check ingredient lists for “E219,” “sodium methylparaben,” or related names.
- If you prefer to avoid parabens, look for products using alternatives like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid)/[potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid)/[sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate).
