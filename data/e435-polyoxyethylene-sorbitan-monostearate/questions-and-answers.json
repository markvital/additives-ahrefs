      "q": "is polysorbate 60 safe to eat",
      "a": "Yes—polysorbate 60 (E435) is approved as a food additive and considered safe at permitted levels; regulators have set an acceptable daily intake and typical exposure is well below it.",

    {
      "q": "is polysorbate 60 toxic",
      "a": "It isn’t considered toxic at food-use levels; very high doses in studies can cause gastrointestinal effects, and rare hypersensitivity reactions are mostly linked to medical (injectable) use rather than foods.",

    {
      "q": "is polysorbate 60 bad for you",

      "q": "is polysorbate 60 a dye",

      "q": "is polysorbate 60 natural",
      "a": "No—it’s a synthetic emulsifier made by reacting sorbitan and stearic acid with ethylene oxide; the stearic acid can be from plant or animal sources.",
