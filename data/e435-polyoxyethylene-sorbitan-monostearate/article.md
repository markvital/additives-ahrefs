Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, better known as Polysorbate 60 (E435), is a common emulsifier and stabiliser. It helps oil and water mix smoothly and keeps whipped or creamy foods from separating. You’ll see it in products like whipped toppings, coffee creamers, and baked goods.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made from sorbitan (from sorbitol), stearic acid, and ethylene oxide.
- What it does: Blends oil and water, stabilises foams, and improves texture in creamy and baked foods.
- Where it’s found: Whipped toppings, non-dairy creamers, ice cream, frostings, cake mixes, sauces, and emulsified shortenings.
- Also called: Polysorbate 60; labeled as E435 in the EU.

## Why is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate added to food?
Food makers use E435 to keep oil and water mixed, stabilise air bubbles in whipped products, and create a smooth, uniform texture. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists polysorbate 60 as a permitted food additive for specified uses and levels, where it functions as an emulsifier and stabiliser.[^1]

## What foods contain Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate?
You’re most likely to find E435 in:
- Whipped toppings and non-dairy creamers
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Ready-to-spread frostings and icings
- Cake mixes, snack cakes, and other baked goods
- Sauces, dressings, and emulsified shortenings

On labels, it may appear as “Polysorbate 60” or “Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (E435).”

## What can replace Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate?
Depending on the recipe, formulators might swap in:
- Other polysorbates: [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate), [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate](/e434-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monopalmitate), or [polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate](/e436-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-tristearate)
- Non-polysorbate emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), or [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)

The best alternative depends on taste, texture, and processing needs.

## How is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate made?
E435 is produced in two main steps. First, sorbitol is partially dehydrated to sorbitan and reacted with stearic acid to form sorbitan monostearate. Then ethylene oxide is added to attach polyoxyethylene chains, creating the final “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate.” U.S. regulations describe this process and set identity and purity specifications.[^1] In the EU, detailed purity specifications are laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate safe to eat?
When used within legal limits, E435 is considered safe by major regulators. In the United States, it is an approved food additive with defined uses and manufacturing specifications under FDA rules.[^1] In the European Union, E435 is authorised as a food additive under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^3] As with all authorised additives, food manufacturers must follow strict use conditions set by law.

## Does Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate have any benefits?
E435 does not add nutrition, but it improves food quality:
- Smoother textures in creams, sauces, and desserts
- Stable foams in whipped products
- Better mixing of oil- and water-based ingredients
- Improved crumb softness and shelf life in some baked goods

## Who should avoid Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate?
- People with a known sensitivity to polysorbates should avoid it when advised by their healthcare provider.
- Anyone following a medical diet that limits emulsifiers should consult a professional to see if E435 fits their plan.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Polysorbate 60 is antifreeze.” Fact: It is not antifreeze. It’s an emulsifier used to blend ingredients and stabilise textures in food.
- Myth: “Because ethylene oxide is used in making it, the additive contains it.” Fact: The final food-grade ingredient is purified, and regulations set strict limits for potential residual impurities in specifications.[^2]
- Myth: “All polysorbates are the same.” Fact: Different polysorbates use different fatty acids, which can change their performance. For example, E432, E433, E434, and E436 each have different fatty acid components.

## Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate in branded foods
You may see E435 on ingredient lists for:
- Whipped toppings, aerosol whipped creams, and coffee creamers
- Ice cream, frozen yogurt, and novelty desserts
- Frostings, bakery mixes, snack cakes, and pastries
On packages, it often appears as “Polysorbate 60,” “Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate,” or “E435” (in the EU).
