Acid-treated modified starch (E1401) is a modified starch that helps thicken and stabilize foods. It gives sauces and candies a smooth, consistent texture and holds up during cooking.

At a glance
- Also called/E-number: E1401, acid-modified starch, acid-thinned starch; in the U.S. often labeled as “modified food starch”
- What it does: Thickener, stabilizer, helps emulsions stay mixed
- Common in: Gravies, sauces, soups, salad dressings, pie fillings, confectionery (gummies, jelly candies), canned and frozen meals
- Diet flags: Plant-based and typically vegan; may be gluten-free if not from wheat—check labels for “wheat” if you avoid gluten

1) Why it’s added to food
- It thickens and stabilizes foods so they do not separate. It gives low hot viscosity for easy processing, then sets into a firm gel as it cools—useful in candies and pie fillings.
- Look for it if you want smooth sauces and consistent texture. Avoid if you prefer only “native” starches like cornstarch or tapioca.

2) What foods it’s found in
- You may see it in jarred or canned gravies and sauces, ready-to-eat soups, salad dressings, pie fillings, puddings, and confectionery like jelly candies and gummies.
- It also appears in frozen meals and some dairy-style desserts. Check ingredient lists for “modified food starch” or “E1401” on imported products.

3) What are its alternatives
- Kitchen swaps: cornstarch, tapioca starch, potato starch, rice flour.
- Other additives: pectin, gelatin, xanthan gum, guar gum.
- Shopping tip: If you want simpler labels, look for products that list “cornstarch” or “tapioca starch” instead of “modified food starch.”

4) How Acid-treated modified starch is manufactured
- Food-grade starch (often corn, potato, or tapioca) is mixed with water and treated with a small amount of food-grade acid under controlled heat. This partially breaks the starch chains to lower viscosity.
- The mixture is then neutralized, washed, filtered, and dried. The result is “acid-thinned” starch that processes easily when hot and sets firmly when cooled.

5) How safe is Acid-treated modified starch for consumption?
- Major regulators consider modified starches safe when used as intended. In the U.S., “food starch-modified” (which includes acid-treated types) is permitted in foods under specific good manufacturing practices.
- EFSA has evaluated modified starches (including E1401) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels; an ADI was not considered necessary.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It does not provide direct health benefits. It is mainly a texture and stability aid.
- It may be used as an excipient (binder) in some supplements or tablets. This is a functional, not therapeutic, use.

7) When Acid-treated modified starch may be unsafe (contraindications)
- If you have celiac disease or a wheat allergy, check for source. In the U.S., wheat must be declared, so avoid products listing “modified food starch (wheat)” or any “Contains: Wheat.”
- If you are sensitive to certain starch sources (e.g., corn or potato), choose products that list a source you tolerate. When unsure, pick items labeled “gluten-free” or contact the manufacturer.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Modified starch is synthetic and unsafe.” Fact: It is food starch with small, approved changes to improve performance; regulators consider it safe when used as intended. Source: FDA eCFR — Food starch-modified (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “Modified starch always contains gluten.” Fact: Many are from corn, potato, or tapioca; in the U.S., wheat sources must be declared on the label. Source: FDA (Food Allergen Labeling guidance, fda.gov) (URL to be added by editor)
- Myth: “Acid-treated starch makes foods acidic.” Fact: The acid is neutralized and the starch is washed; the final ingredient does not make foods meaningfully more acidic. Source: JECFA (FAO/WHO specifications for modified starches) (URL to be added by editor)

Acid-treated modified starch in Branded Foods
- You’ll find it in jarred gravies, shelf-stable sauces and soups, salad dressings, pie fillings, and gummy or jelly candies. Many frozen meals and ready sides also use it for consistent texture.
- Note: Specific FoodData Central branded items vary by market and time.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is E1401 the same as “modified food starch”?  
  Yes. E1401 is an acid-treated type of modified starch. In the U.S., labels usually say “modified food starch” rather than the E-number.
- Is E1401 gluten-free?  
  It can be if made from corn, potato, or tapioca. If it comes from wheat, U.S. labels must declare “wheat,” so check for allergen statements or “gluten-free” claims.
- What does E1401 do in candy and desserts?  
  It gives low hot viscosity for easy cooking and a firm gel when cooled. This helps set gummies, jelly candies, and pie fillings cleanly.
- Can I cook with a substitute at home?  
  Yes. Try cornstarch, tapioca starch, or potato starch for thickening. Use pectin or gelatin for gelled desserts, and xanthan or guar gum for extra stability.
- Is E1401 safe for kids?  
  It is generally recognized as safe when used as intended. If your child has a wheat allergy or celiac disease, check labels for the source and allergen statements.
