## Why skincare formulators use it
Niacinamide is a stability-friendly active that brightens uneven tone, strengthens the skin barrier, and visibly shrinks the look of pores. It plays well with most ingredients, making it an easy addition to toners, serums, and moisturizers.

## Things to know
Studies show concentrations between 2% and 10% provide measurable benefits while remaining gentle. Pairing niacinamide with zinc or tranexamic acid can enhance clarity, but overly high levels may cause temporary flushing for sensitive skin.

## Popular formats
You will find it in daily serums, gel creams, and milky essences designed for brightening or oil-balancing routines. It often appears alongside hyaluronic acid or ceramides for all-in-one barrier support.
