Carotenoids (E160) are a family of yellow, orange, and red color additives used to make foods look bright and consistent. They can come from plants, algae, fermentation, or careful chemical synthesis, and include well-known members like beta‑carotene, lycopene, annatto, and paprika extract. Some carotenoids also act as provitamin A, depending on the type and amount used.

## At a glance
- Carotenoids are fat‑soluble pigments used mainly as colorants. The E160 group includes members such as [carotene](/e160a-carotene), [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene), [plant carotenes](/e160aii-plant-carotenes), [algal carotenes](/e160aiv-algal-carotenes), [annatto](/e160b-annatto), [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), [beta‑apo‑8′‑carotenal (C30)](/e160e-beta-apo-8-carotenal-c30), and [ethyl ester of beta‑apo‑8′‑carotenic acid (C30)](/e160f-ethyl-ester-of-beta-apo-8-carotenic-acid-c-30).
- They help standardize color in foods and drinks, especially when natural ingredients vary by season.
- Typical uses include beverages, dairy, desserts, snacks, sauces, and bakery items.
- Heat, light, and oxygen can fade carotenoid color, so products often protect them with emulsions or packaging.
- Suitability for vegetarians or vegans depends on the specific preparation and carriers; labels may list oils, starches, or gelatin.

## Why is Carotenoids added to food?
Carotenoids are added to give foods a warm yellow‑to‑red color and to keep that color stable from batch to batch. This helps foods look appealing and recognizable, even when natural raw materials change over time. In the European Union (EU), the E160 group is authorized as food color additives, with specific rules on where and how much can be used.[^1]

## What foods contain Carotenoids?
You can find carotenoids in:
- Soft drinks, juices, and flavored waters
- Yogurts, dairy drinks, cheeses, and ice creams
- Breakfast cereals, baked goods, and bars
- Savory snacks, soups, sauces, and ready meals
- Confectionery and dessert mixes

On labels, look for “E160,” the specific name (for example, “beta‑carotene” or “paprika extract”), or terms like “annatto extract” and “lycopene.”

## What can replace Carotenoids?
If a product cannot use E160 colors, other permitted colorants may be chosen based on the shade and processing needs:
- Yellow to orange: [curcumin](/e100-curcumin), [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin), [caramel colors](/e150-caramel)
- Red: [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red)
- Green: [chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins)
- Whitening/opacity: [titanium dioxide](/e171-titanium-dioxide)
Sometimes manufacturers also switch within the E160 family, such as between [annatto](/e160b-annatto) and [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), to match a target hue.

## How is Carotenoids made?
Commercial carotenoids reach food in several ways:
- Extraction from natural sources (for example, paprika peppers for paprika oleoresin, Bixa orellana seeds for annatto, tomatoes for lycopene, and mixed plant sources for carotenes).[^2]
- Fermentation by selected microorganisms (for example, beta‑carotene from Blakeslea trispora).[^3]
- Chemical synthesis that yields the same molecule as found in nature (for example, some beta‑carotene or C30 carotenoids).[^2]

After production, carotenoids are often formulated into oils, emulsions, powders, or microencapsulated forms to improve stability and make them easier to mix into foods.[^2]

## Is Carotenoids safe to eat?
In the EU, carotenoids in the E160 group are authorized food color additives, and each has detailed identity and purity specifications set in law.[^1][^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has re‑evaluated several members of the group (such as mixed carotenes and beta‑carotene) and did not identify safety concerns at the authorized uses and levels.[^3] 

In the United States, several carotenoids (including annatto extract, beta‑carotene, lycopene from tomatoes, and paprika oleoresin) appear on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) list of color additives permitted for use in foods.[^5]

## Does Carotenoids have any benefits?
Some carotenoids, such as beta‑carotene, are provitamin A. That means the body can convert them into vitamin A, which supports vision, immunity, and normal growth.[^6] Not all carotenoids have vitamin A activity; lycopene and some others do not.[^6] In regular foods, carotenoids mainly serve as colorants. Any nutrition benefit depends on the specific carotenoid and its amount.

## Who should avoid Carotenoids?
- People who have been advised to avoid certain colors (for example, during an elimination diet) should check labels for the exact E‑number or name.
- Those with known sensitivities to a particular source (such as annatto) or to carriers used in preparations (like specific oils or gelatin) should review ingredient lists.
- High‑dose beta‑carotene supplements are not advised for smokers or former heavy smokers because some studies found increased lung cancer risk with such supplements; this does not apply to the small amounts used as food colors.[^6]

## Myths & facts
- “Natural carotenoids are always safer than synthetic.” Both forms are regulated and must meet strict purity and use conditions; safety depends on the molecule, quality, and amount used, not only on the source.[^2]
- “Carotenoids will make food taste like vegetables.” They are used at low levels for color and do not add a vegetable taste.
- “All carotenoids are vitamin A.” Only provitamin A carotenoids (such as some carotenes) can be converted to vitamin A; others, like lycopene, cannot.[^6]
- “They always keep their color.” Carotenoids can fade with heat, light, and oxygen, so manufacturers use protective formulations and packaging.

## Carotenoids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you might see “E160,” “beta‑carotene (color),” “annatto extract (color),” “paprika oleoresin,” or “lycopene.” Many well‑known drinks, yogurts, snacks, and cheeses use one or more carotenoids to achieve a consistent golden, orange, or red tone. If you prefer a specific source (for example, plant‑derived vs. fermentation‑derived), look for the detailed name next to E160 or the additive name itself.
