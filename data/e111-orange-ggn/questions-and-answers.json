      "q": "how to separate lauric acid from alpha naphthol",
      "a": "This concerns alpha‑naphthol (not the dye E111, which is Orange GGN); in a lab mixture, lauric acid is typically separated from 1‑naphthol by acid–base extraction (e.g., extract the acid into aqueous bicarbonate, then re‑acidify to recover it).",
