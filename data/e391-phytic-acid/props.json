  "description": "Phytic acid -known as inositol hexakisphosphate -IP6-, inositol polyphosphate, or phytate when in salt form- is the phosphate ester of inositol. It contains six phosphate groups.  At physiological pH, these phosphates are partially ionized.  The resulting anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, especially bran and seeds. It can be found in cereals and grains. Catabolites of phytic acid are called lower inositol polyphosphates. Examples are inositol penta- -IP5-, tetra- -IP4-, and triphosphate -IP3-.",
