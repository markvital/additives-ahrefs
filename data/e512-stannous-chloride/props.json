  "description": "TinII chloride, also known as stannous chloride, is a white crystalline solid with the formula SnCl2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent -in acid solution-, and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin-II- chloride should not be confused with the other chloride of tin; tin-IV- chloride or stannic chloride -SnCl4-.",
