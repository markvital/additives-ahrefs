      "q": "is ammonium bicarbonate bad for you",
      "a": "At normal food-use levels, ammonium bicarbonate (E503ii) isn’t considered harmful and decomposes during baking into carbon dioxide and ammonia that largely dissipate. High ammonia vapors can irritate eyes and airways, so thorough baking prevents residual odor or taste.",

      "q": "is ammonium bicarbonate safe in food",
      "a": "Yes—it's permitted as a leavening agent in many countries (GRAS in the U.S. and authorized in the EU as E503ii) when used under good manufacturing practice, and proper baking drives off residual ammonia.",

      "q": "what is ammonium bicarbonate in food",
      "a": "Ammonium bicarbonate (ammonium hydrogen carbonate, “baker’s ammonia”) is a leavening agent used mainly in low-moisture baked goods. When heated, it releases carbon dioxide and ammonia to aerate dough and create a crisp texture.",

      "q": "how to make ammonium bicarbonate buffer",
      "a": "Dissolve the needed amount in water (e.g., 7.9 g per liter for 0.1 M) and adjust to about pH 8 with ammonium hydroxide or dilute acid if required. Prepare fresh and keep cool, as it slowly decomposes and loses CO2/ammonia over time.",

    {
      "q": "what is ammonium bicarbonate used for",
      "a": "Primarily as a leavening agent for cookies, crackers, and traditional biscuits/gingerbread to achieve a dry, crisp texture. It’s also used as a pH control/buffering agent in some food and laboratory applications.",
