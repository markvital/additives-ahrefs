Ammonium phosphatides (E442) are emulsifiers that help oil and water mix, most often used to improve the flow and smoothness of chocolate and confectionery. They are made from vegetable oils, phosphoric acid, and ammonia, and used in very small amounts to fine‑tune texture.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier made from vegetable oils, phosphoric acid, and ammonia
- What it does: improves flow in chocolate and helps fats and water blend evenly
- Where you’ll find it: mainly chocolate, compound coatings, confectionery, and some spreads
- Also called: ammonium salts of phosphorylated glycerides; Emulsifier YN
- Dietary notes: typically produced from vegetable sources; check with the maker if you need vegan, halal, or kosher assurance
- Label reading: may appear as “E442” or “ammonium phosphatides”

## Why is ammonium phosphatides added to food?
It is added to make mixtures of fat and water behave better, especially in chocolate. A tiny dose can reduce chocolate viscosity (how thick it feels when melted), making it easier to mould, coat, and pump while keeping a smooth mouthfeel.[^1]

## What foods contain ammonium phosphatides?
In the European Union (EU), E442 is authorised as a food additive in categories that include cocoa and chocolate products and certain confectionery items. Actual use is mostly in chocolate bars, compound chocolate coatings (such as for biscuits or ice cream), pralines, truffles, and chocolate spreads.[^3] Always check the ingredient list—manufacturers sometimes use alternative emulsifiers depending on recipe and price.

## What can replace ammonium phosphatides?
Food makers often choose among several emulsifiers to get the texture they want:
- Lecithins, commonly from soy or sunflower: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins)
- Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), frequently used in chocolate: [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate)
- Sorbitan esters (depending on application): for example [sorbitan tristearate](/e492-sorbitan-tristearate)
The best substitute depends on the product type and the target viscosity, flavour release, and cost.

## How is ammonium phosphatides made?
Ammonium phosphatides are made by first producing glycerides (from glycerol and edible fatty acids, typically from vegetable oils such as rapeseed/canola), then reacting them with food‑grade phosphoric acid to form phosphorylated glycerides, and finally neutralising with ammonia to form ammonium salts. EU specifications describe the identity and purity of E442 and allow vegetable‑oil sources; rapeseed oil is commonly used in practice.[^2][^1]

## Is ammonium phosphatides safe to eat?
E442 is authorised in the EU under food additive law and must meet defined identity and purity criteria. When used within the rules and at levels needed for the intended effect, it is considered acceptable for use in food.[^3][^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated ammonium phosphatides and did not identify safety concerns for the general population at the reported uses and use levels.[^1]

Note: EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority, the EU’s scientific risk‑assessment body; EU refers to the European Union.

## Does ammonium phosphatides have any benefits?
For consumers, the main benefits are indirect: smoother, more consistent chocolate that melts well and coats evenly. For manufacturers, it can improve processing (pumping, moulding, enrobing) and may reduce the amount of cocoa butter needed to reach a target flow, which can help control cost without changing taste.

## Who should avoid ammonium phosphatides?
- People following very strict dietary rules (vegan, halal, kosher) may wish to confirm the source of the glycerol and fatty acids with the manufacturer, even though E442 is typically made from vegetable oils.
- Individuals who prefer minimal‑ingredient or “additive‑free” foods might choose products that use alternatives like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) instead.

Allergies to E442 are uncommon because it is highly refined and used at very low levels, but as with any ingredient, discontinue consumption if you suspect a reaction.

## Myths & facts
- “It contains ammonia, so it must be harsh.” The final ingredient contains the ammonium ion (NH4+), a common food nutrient form; it is not the same as household ammonia solution.
- “It’s just a filler.” E442 is used at very small levels to control texture and flow; it is not a bulking agent.
- “All emulsifiers taste waxy.” Properly used, E442 is neutral in taste and designed not to affect flavour.

## Ammonium phosphatides in branded foods
You’ll most often see E442 on labels of chocolate bars, boxed chocolates, chocolate‑coated biscuits, ice‑cream coatings, and cocoa‑based spreads. On packaging, it may be listed as “ammonium phosphatides,” “E442,” or “ammonium salts of phosphorylated glycerides.” Ingredient choices vary by brand and recipe, so some products will instead use [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [PGPR](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate).
