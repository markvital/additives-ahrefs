Astaxanthin (E161J) is a red-orange pigment from the carotenoid family. It appears naturally in microalgae and gives salmon, trout, shrimp, and krill their rosy color. In foods, it is mainly used for coloring via animal feed and in some regions as a supplement ingredient.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of what astaxanthin is and how it shows up in foods.
- What it is: A red-orange carotenoid (xanthophyll) pigment found in microalgae and seafood.
- What it does: Colors foods (especially via fish feed); also acts as an antioxidant in fats and oils.
- Where you’ll see it: Farmed salmon and trout flesh (through feed), and as an ingredient in some dietary supplements in certain markets.
- Regulatory note: In the U.S., astaxanthin is permitted as a color additive in salmonid fish feed under 21 CFR Part 73 Subpart C. In the EU, astaxanthin-rich extracts from the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis are authorized as novel foods mainly for use in supplements, with conditions. [^2][^4]

## Why is Astaxanthin added to food?
Astaxanthin is added to provide a warm pink to red hue and to help stabilize color during storage. In aquaculture, it restores the characteristic color of salmonid fish by being added to feed. [^2] In the EU, certain astaxanthin-rich ingredients are authorized as novel foods, mainly for use in food supplements. [^4]

## What foods contain Astaxanthin?
Astaxanthin occurs naturally in many seafoods, including salmon, trout, shrimp, and krill. [^1] As a food additive, you’ll encounter it most clearly in farmed salmonid fish, where the pigment is present in the flesh because it was added to the animal’s feed. [^2] In the EU, astaxanthin-rich extracts from Haematococcus pluvialis may be used in food supplements under the conditions of the Union list of novel foods. [^4]

## What can replace Astaxanthin?
Other colorants can provide similar warm shades, depending on the food and the target color:
- Orange to red carotenoids like [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
- Related xanthophylls such as [lutein](/e161b-lutein) or [canthaxanthin](/e161g-canthaxanthin)  
The best substitute depends on solubility, processing conditions, and labeling needs.

## How is Astaxanthin made?
In nature, microalgae such as Haematococcus pluvialis make astaxanthin, and it moves up the food chain into fish and shellfish. [^1] Commercially, manufacturers typically cultivate algae or specific yeasts and then extract astaxanthin into an oil (oleoresin) or make stabilized powders suited for food or feed uses. [^4]

## Is Astaxanthin safe to eat?
When used as allowed by regulators, astaxanthin is considered safe for its intended uses. In the U.S., the FDA lists color additives for animal feed under 21 CFR Part 73 Subpart C, and astaxanthin is among the colorants permitted for salmonid feed under specified conditions. [^2][^3] In the EU, astaxanthin-rich extracts from Haematococcus pluvialis are authorized as novel foods mainly for food supplements, and products must meet composition and purity rules. [^4]

## Does Astaxanthin have any benefits?
From a food technology view, astaxanthin imparts a stable red-orange color and can help protect fats and oils from oxidation because it is an antioxidant carotenoid. [^1] These functions can support color consistency and shelf life in suitable applications.

## Who should avoid Astaxanthin?
If you avoid added colors, check labels on seafood and supplements. People with specific dietary restrictions, allergies, or who are pregnant or nursing should talk with a healthcare professional before using astaxanthin-containing supplements. Local rules may also limit how and where it can be used in foods. [^4]

## Myths & facts
- “Farmed salmon is dyed.” Fact: The pink color comes from carotenoids like astaxanthin added to feed, mimicking the natural diet of wild fish.
- “Natural and synthetic astaxanthin are different colors.” Myth: The molecule provides the same characteristic red-orange hue; differences are more about source and formulation.
- “All carotenoids are the same.” Myth: Carotenoids vary. For example, [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) is more orange, while astaxanthin gives a deeper pink-red tone; others like [lutein](/e161b-lutein) and [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin) skew more yellow.

## Astaxanthin in branded foods
You’ll most often see astaxanthin linked to:
- Farmed salmon and trout (color present due to feed). [^2][^3]
- Dietary supplements (often labeled as astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis in the EU’s novel foods framework). [^4]
