Lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472b) are food emulsifiers that help oil and water mix, keep textures smooth, and improve the feel of baked goods. You’ll often see them in breads, cakes, whipped toppings, and dairy-style products where stable, fine texture matters.

## At a glance
- E-number: E472b; also called lactylated mono- and diglycerides
- Role: emulsifier and stabiliser that helps keep mixtures uniform
- Common in: breads, cakes, whipped toppings, desserts, and creamers
- Typically made from food-grade fats/oils, glycerol, and lactic acid
- Approved for use in both the U.S. and EU
- Vegan/vegetarian suitability depends on the fat source; ask the manufacturer if this matters to you

## Why is lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers add E472b to help oil and water stay mixed, prevent separation, and create a fine, even crumb or foam. In baked goods, it supports dough handling and helps keep products soft for longer. In creams, toppings, and sauces, it stabilises air bubbles and droplets so the texture stays smooth and consistent over shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
E472b turns up most often in:
- Yeast-leavened breads, buns, and rolls
- Cakes, muffins, and cake mixes
- Whipped toppings and dessert mixes
- Non-dairy creamers and similar emulsified products
In the United States, its use is permitted in specific food categories and at set levels listed in 21 CFR 172.848.[^1]

## What can replace lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Depending on the recipe, formulators may swap E472b with:
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) from soy, sunflower, or rapeseed
- Dough-strengthening lactylates such as [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)

## How is lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
E472b is produced by reacting food-grade mono- and diglycerides (from edible fats and oils) with lactic acid or with small lactic acid polymers (“lactylic” units). The result is a family of related molecules with one or more lactic acid groups attached, giving them strong emulsifying power.[^1] In the EU, detailed composition and purity specifications for E472b are set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes the use of lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides as a food additive and sets conditions for their safe use in 21 CFR 172.848.[^1] In the EU, E472b is listed as an authorized food additive in the food additive framework regulation, with specifications defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

## Does lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
For bakers and food makers, E472b offers several practical benefits:
- Keeps emulsions stable so products do not separate
- Improves dough handling and helps achieve a fine, even crumb
- Supports stable foams in whipped toppings and aerated desserts
These functions help maintain quality and consistency from factory to table.[^1]

## Who should avoid lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
- People who follow vegan, vegetarian, kosher, or halal diets may wish to confirm the fat source (plant vs. animal) with the manufacturer, since the starting fatty acids come from “edible fats and oils.”[^1]
- Those with strict clean-label preferences might choose products that use alternatives like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins).

Note: Despite the name, the “lactic” part does not mean milk is used; lactic acid for food use is commonly made by fermenting carbohydrate sources.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It contains lactose, so it’s a milk ingredient.” Fact: Food-grade lactic acid is typically produced by fermentation of sugars, not milk, and E472b does not contain lactose.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s a single synthetic chemical.” Fact: E472b is a group of food emulsifiers made from glycerides and lactic acid; it is standardized and regulated for food use in both the U.S. and EU.[^1][^2]

## Lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists you might see it written as “E472b,” “lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids,” or “lactylated mono- and diglycerides.” It is common in packaged sandwich breads and rolls, shelf-stable cakes and mixes, whipped toppings, and some non-dairy creamers. If you have dietary restrictions, contact the brand to confirm the source of the fats used.
