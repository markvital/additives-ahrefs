Oxidised polyethylene wax (E914) is a food-grade wax used to coat the surface of some fresh produce. It helps fruit keep moisture, resist scuffing, and look shiny while it travels from farm to store. It is applied as a very thin film and is not mixed into the food itself.

## At a glance
- What it is: a wax made by oxidising polyethylene, used as a glazing agent on fruit.
- What it does: forms a thin protective coating to reduce moisture loss and improve gloss.
- Where you’ll see it: on the surface of some waxed fruits sold in the EU and other markets.
- Typical label: “glazing agent: E914” or “oxidised polyethylene wax.”
- Prep tip: peeling or trimming the rind removes most of the coating.

## Why is Oxidised polyethylene wax added to food?
Producers use E914 as a glazing agent. A glazing agent is added to a surface to give shine or a protective layer so the food looks better and keeps longer during transport and storage.[^2]

## What foods contain Oxidised polyethylene wax?
E914 is used on the surface of some fresh fruits, such as citrus fruit and other produce that may be sold “waxed.” In the EU, it is authorised as a glazing agent for the surface treatment of certain fruits; it is not used inside the fruit itself.[^2] If present, it will appear in the ingredient list or near the produce name as an additive.

## What can replace Oxidised polyethylene wax?
Food makers may choose other glazing agents, depending on the fruit, the desired shine, and dietary needs:
- Plant waxes such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax)
- Animal-derived options like [shellac](/e904-shellac) or [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax)
- Mineral/petroleum waxes such as [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax) or [montanic acid esters](/e912-montanic-acid-esters)

## How is Oxidised polyethylene wax made?
E914 is produced by oxidising polyethylene wax with air or oxygen. This process adds oxygen-containing groups to the polymer, turning it into a harder, more polar wax that can form a stable, thin film on fruit surfaces.[^1]

## Is Oxidised polyethylene wax safe to eat?
In the EU, E914 has specifications and purity criteria set by law, and its use as a food additive is authorised for defined surface treatments.[^1][^2] It is applied as a very thin coating; typical consumer exposure is low, and peeling or trimming the rind further reduces how much is eaten.

## Does Oxidised polyethylene wax have any benefits?
Yes. A wax coating helps fruit lose water more slowly, reduces scuffing during handling, and keeps a consistent appearance. This can reduce waste during shipping and display. It also provides a glossy finish many shoppers expect on certain fruits.

## Who should avoid Oxidised polyethylene wax?
- If you prefer to avoid petroleum-derived waxes, choose “unwaxed” fruit where available or peel before eating.
- For infants and toddlers, many caregivers peel fruit as a general practice to reduce choking risk and remove surface coatings.
- People with strict dietary rules (for example, avoiding animal-derived additives) may prefer E914 over shellac or beeswax, or choose plant-based alternatives like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax).

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It puts plastic on my fruit.” Fact: The coating is a food-grade wax made to strict specifications and used in very small amounts on the surface.
- Myth: “You can’t wash it off.” Fact: It is designed to stick through normal washing, but peeling or trimming the rind removes most of it.
- Myth: “It changes the taste of fruit.” Fact: At the tiny amounts used, it is not added for flavour and should not noticeably change taste or smell.
- Myth: “All waxes are the same.” Fact: Waxes can be plant-based, animal-derived, or petroleum/mineral-based, and each behaves differently on different fruits.

## Oxidised polyethylene wax in branded foods
You’ll most often see E914 on labels of waxed fresh produce (for example, certain citrus fruits) in regions that use E-numbers. Look for wording such as “glazing agent: E914” or “coated with oxidised polyethylene wax.” In the EU, additives must be listed by their function (like “glazing agent”) plus name or E-number when they are ingredients or used on the surface of foods sold prepacked.[^3] Exact usage varies by country, fruit type, and supplier.
