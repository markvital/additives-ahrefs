      "a": "This isn’t related to the food additive E402; E402 denotes potassium alginate, a seaweed-derived thickener/stabiliser used to form calcium-set gels, thicken sauces, and stabilize emulsions.",

      "q": "dx-e402 how to set up",
      "a": "E402 refers to potassium alginate, not a device; in food processing it’s dispersed in water (often under high shear) and, if gelling is desired, calcium is added to set the gel.",

    {
      "q": "how is potassium alginate used in food",
      "a": "It’s used as a thickener, stabiliser, and gelling agent from seaweed. Dispersed in liquids to increase viscosity and stabilize emulsions/foams, it forms heat-stable gels when calcium is added (e.g., spherification, restructured foods, desserts).",
