Inosinic acid (E630) is a flavor enhancer that boosts savory, umami taste. It is the nucleotide inosine 5'-monophosphate (often called IMP) and is used at very small amounts to make foods taste richer. You’ll often see it paired with glutamates for a stronger umami effect.

## At a glance
- What it is: a nucleotide (IMP) used as a flavor enhancer that intensifies umami taste
- What it does: deepens savory flavor and can make seasonings more effective at low doses
- Where it’s found: instant noodles, soup mixes, sauces, snacks, and savory seasonings
- Label names: “inosinic acid,” “5'-inosinic acid,” “IMP,” or “E630”
- Related additives: its salts such as [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [dipotassium inosinate](/e632-dipotassium-inosinate), and [calcium inosinate](/e633-calcium-inosinate)

## Why is Inosinic acid added to food?
Food makers add E630 to boost umami—the mouth-filling savory taste that makes broths, meats, and many snacks seem fuller and more satisfying.[^1] It often works alongside sources of glutamate, such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) or natural glutamate in ingredients like tomatoes and cheeses, to amplify flavor at low use levels.

## What foods contain Inosinic acid?
E630 appears in a wide range of savory products, typically where a strong, rounded taste is desired. Common examples include instant soups and noodle seasonings, bouillon and stock cubes, snack seasonings and chips, sauces and condiments, and processed meat seasonings.[^1]

## What can replace Inosinic acid?
- Other umami enhancers: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [glutamic acid](/e620-glutamic-acid), or blended enhancers like [disodium 5'-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide)
- Closely related nucleotides: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate) and guanylate salts such as [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), [dipotassium guanylate](/e628-dipotassium-guanylate), and [calcium guanylate](/e629-calcium-guanylate), or the acid form [guanylic acid](/e626-guanylic-acid)
- Ingredient alternatives: yeast extract, mushroom concentrates, seaweed, tomato concentrates, and aged cheeses for “clean-label” umami

## How is Inosinic acid made?
Chemically, E630 is inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP)—a phosphate group attached to the nucleoside inosine.[^3] For food use it is manufactured and then purified so it meets legally defined specifications for identity and purity (for example, assay limits and impurity controls) before it can be used in the EU.[^2]

## Is Inosinic acid safe to eat?
E630 is authorized as a food additive in the European Union, with detailed specifications published in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2] The Codex Alimentarius (FAO/WHO) lists inosinic acid (INS 630) as a flavor enhancer and includes it in many food categories at good manufacturing practice (GMP) levels, reflecting international acceptance of its use when applied appropriately.[^1]

## Does Inosinic acid have any benefits?
- Enhances savory, umami taste, making flavors seem richer
- Works effectively at low concentrations, so only small amounts are needed
- Can complement glutamate-containing ingredients for a stronger overall flavor impact

## Who should avoid Inosinic acid?
- People who are advised to limit dietary purines (for example, those managing gout or high uric acid) sometimes choose to limit added nucleotides like IMP. If this applies to you, ask your healthcare professional whether E630 fits your diet.
- If you follow vegetarian or vegan diets and want to avoid animal-derived inputs, note that production methods can vary by manufacturer; check with the brand if source matters to you.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as MSG.” False. E630 is a nucleotide (IMP); MSG is a glutamate salt. They are different additives, though they are often used together for stronger umami.
- “It’s a preservative.” False. E630 is used for flavor enhancement, not for preserving food.
- “It always comes from meat.” Not necessarily. Manufacturing methods vary, and products must meet purity specifications regardless of source.[^2]
- “It’s used in large amounts.” False. Effective levels are typically very small because it is a potent enhancer.[^1]

## Inosinic acid in branded foods
You’ll most often spot E630 on labels for instant noodle packets, bouillon and stock cubes, savory snacks and chips, dry soup mixes, spice blends, and some ready meals. Look for “inosinic acid,” “5'-IMP,” or “E630” in the ingredient list, sometimes alongside [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) or other ribonucleotides.
