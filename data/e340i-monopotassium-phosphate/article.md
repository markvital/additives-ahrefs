Monopotassium phosphate (E340i) is a food-grade mineral salt that helps control acidity and keep textures smooth and stable. It shows up in drinks, dairy-style products, and processed cheeses where it works as a buffer and emulsifying salt.

## At a glance
- E-number: E340i (Monopotassium phosphate)
- Also called: Monobasic potassium phosphate; potassium dihydrogen phosphate
- What it does: Controls acidity (buffer), stabilises textures, helps ingredients mix (emulsifier), holds moisture (humectant)
- Typical form: White, water‑soluble crystals; neutral to slightly saline taste
- Where you’ll see it: Electrolyte and sports drinks, processed cheese and cheese sauces, powdered drink mixes, coffee creamers, and some bakery mixes
- Dietary note: It’s a mineral salt made by reacting phosphoric acid with a potassium base; no animal-derived ingredients are required

## Why is Monopotassium phosphate added to food?
Food makers use monopotassium phosphate to regulate pH so flavors stay consistent and proteins behave well, especially in dairy-style products and cheese sauces. As an “emulsifying salt,” it helps disperse and melt cheese evenly; as a buffer, it keeps drinks clear and shelf-stable. In the EU it is authorized as a food additive (E 340i) within the phosphate group for roles such as acidity regulation and emulsification in specified foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Monopotassium phosphate?
You’re most likely to find it in:
- Electrolyte and sports drinks, flavored waters, and some energy drinks
- Processed cheese, cheese slices, and cheese sauces
- Dairy alternatives (e.g., shelf-stable beverages) and creamers
- Powdered drink mixes, instant cocoa, and coffee whiteners
- Some bakery mixes and ready-to-mix batters

Ingredient lists may show “monopotassium phosphate,” “potassium phosphate (monobasic),” or “E340i.”

## What can replace Monopotassium phosphate?
Depending on the job it’s doing, formulators may switch to:
- Other potassium phosphates for buffering/emulsifying: [dipotassium phosphate](/e340ii-dipotassium-phosphate) or [tripotassium phosphate](/e340iii-tripotassium-phosphate)
- Sodium-based phosphates for similar functionality: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates)
- Organic acid systems for tartness and buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with [sodium citrate](/e331-sodium-citrates) or [potassium citrate](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- For pH adjustment, alkaline salts such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) can be paired with food acids

Each swap changes taste, sodium/potassium balance, and texture, so it’s not always one‑to‑one.

## How is Monopotassium phosphate made?
Food-grade monopotassium phosphate is produced by neutralizing purified [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid) with a potassium base (commonly potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate), then crystallizing and drying the salt to specification.[^2] The pure compound forms white, water‑soluble crystals with the formula KH2PO4.[^4]

## Is Monopotassium phosphate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed phosphate additives as a group. EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus per kg body weight per day and noted that combined intake from food and additives can be high in some consumers.[^1] When used within the rules for each food category and good manufacturing practice, monopotassium phosphate is considered safe for the general population.

## Does Monopotassium phosphate have any benefits?
- Technological: It stabilizes pH, improves melt and texture in processed cheese, and helps powders dissolve cleanly.
- Nutritional context: It contributes small amounts of potassium and phosphorus—both essential minerals—though it’s used mainly for function, not fortification.
- Quality: In drinks, a stable pH can protect color, clarity, and flavor during shelf life.

## Who should avoid Monopotassium phosphate?
People told by their healthcare provider to limit phosphorus or potassium—such as many individuals with chronic kidney disease—may need to watch for phosphate and potassium salts on labels, including monopotassium phosphate.[^3] Anyone on a medically supervised low‑potassium or low‑phosphate diet should follow personalized advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All phosphates are the same.” Fact: E340i is one of several potassium phosphates; each phosphate salt and level of addition is chosen for a specific job.
- Myth: “E-numbers are warning signs.” Fact: E-numbers are simply EU identifiers for approved additives; they don’t indicate danger by themselves.
- Myth: “It makes food salty.” Fact: This salt contains potassium, not sodium, and is used at low levels aimed at function, not taste.
- Myth: “Buffers change the flavor a lot.” Fact: In most recipes, they’re used at small amounts designed to be flavor‑neutral while controlling pH.

## Monopotassium phosphate in branded foods
On packaging, look for “monopotassium phosphate,” “potassium phosphate (monobasic),” or “E340i.” You’ll commonly see it in electrolyte beverages, processed cheese and sauces, creamers, and drink mixes. If you’re tracking phosphorus or potassium, scanning the ingredient list is the quickest way to spot it and compare products in the same category.
