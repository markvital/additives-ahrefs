Alkaline modified starch (E1402) is a texture helper used to thicken, stabilise, and keep sauces smooth. In U.S. products it usually appears on labels as “modified food starch,” not by E-number. If you want to avoid it, look for products labeled with simple starches like cornstarch or “no modified starch.”

At a glance
- Also called/E-number: Alkaline modified starch; E1402
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, emulsifier that improves texture and freeze–thaw stability
- Common in: Canned soups and sauces, gravies, salad dressings, pie fillings, puddings, plant-based meats, instant noodles, coated snacks
- Diet flags: Plant-based; gluten-free if sourced from corn/potato/tapioca; may contain wheat if made from wheat starch (look for “Contains wheat”)

1) Why it’s added to food
- It helps sauces and fillings stay thick, smooth, and stable during cooking, freezing, and reheating.  
- It prevents separation in dressings and helps batter or coating stick to food.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Shelf-stable and refrigerated sauces, gravies, and soups.  
- Bakery fillings, pie fillings, puddings, and yogurts.  
- Instant noodles, plant-based meats, and breaded or coated frozen foods.  
- U.S. labels typically list it as “modified food starch,” not “E1402.”

3) What are its alternatives
- Pantry swaps for home cooking: cornstarch, potato starch, tapioca starch, arrowroot, or a flour roux.  
- Commercial alternatives: other modified starches, pectin, gelatin (not vegan), agar, xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, or carrageenan.  
- Shopping tip: If you want to avoid modified starches, look for “no modified starch” claims or choose products thickened with “cornstarch,” “tapioca starch,” or “pectin.”

4) How Alkaline modified starch is manufactured
- Food starch (such as corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat) is mixed with water and treated with a mild alkaline solution (often sodium hydroxide) under controlled conditions.  
- The slurry is then neutralized, washed, and dried to yield a powder with improved thickening and stability.  
- The starch source may vary; U.S. labels often do not list the source unless it is wheat.

5) How safe is Alkaline modified starch for consumption?
- Major food safety bodies consider modified starches safe when used as intended.  
- Key evaluations:
  - { "source": "FDA eCFR (21 CFR 172.892 — Food starch-modified)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "Permitted for use in food under good manufacturing practice; includes alkali treatment." }
  - { "source": "EFSA re-evaluation of modified starches (E 1401–E 1452)", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "No safety concern at reported uses; ADI not specified." }

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- It is not used as a nutrient or supplement for health benefits.  
- Some modified starches serve as inactive ingredients (excipients) in tablets and capsules to aid manufacturing and tablet disintegration, not to treat disease.

7) When Alkaline modified starch may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Wheat allergy or celiac disease: It can be made from wheat. In the U.S., wheat must be declared. Check for “Contains wheat.”  
- Very low-carb diets: It is a carbohydrate thickener. Choose products without added starches.  
- Infant foods and medical diets: Follow your clinician’s or product-maker’s guidance on thickeners.

Myths & facts
- “E-numbers like E1402 are unsafe.” Fact: EFSA reviewed modified starches and found no safety concern at reported uses. Source: EFSA (efsa.europa.eu) — URL to be added by editor.  
- “Modified food starch always contains gluten.” Fact: Many are made from corn, potato, or tapioca and are gluten-free; wheat-based versions must declare wheat on the label in the U.S. Source: FDA — Food Allergen Labeling (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor.  
- “Modified starch is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are different ingredients; modified starches are carbohydrates, while MSG is a flavor enhancer (glutamate salt). Source: FDA (fda.gov) — URL to be added by editor.

Alkaline modified starch in Branded Foods
- In the U.S., look for “modified food starch” in soups, sauces, gravies, dressings, puddings, pie fillings, instant noodles, and breaded frozen foods. It may not specify E1402 on the label.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- What is alkaline modified starch (E1402)?  
It is starch treated with alkali to improve thickening and stability. It is used to keep sauces and fillings smooth.

- Is E1402 the same as “modified food starch” on U.S. labels?  
Often yes; U.S. labels use the generic term “modified food starch” rather than E-numbers. The exact modification is usually not listed.

- Is E1402 gluten-free?  
It can be, depending on the source. If made from wheat, the label must state “Contains wheat.”

- Is it safe for kids and during pregnancy?  
Food safety agencies consider modified starches safe when used as intended. If you have a special diet or medical condition, check with your healthcare professional.

- How can I avoid it, and what can I use instead at home?  
Choose products thickened with cornstarch, tapioca, or pectin, or those labeled “no modified starch.” At home, use cornstarch, tapioca, potato starch, arrowroot, or a flour roux.
