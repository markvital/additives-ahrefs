      "q": "cyclic guanosine monophosphate does what",
      "a": "cGMP is a cellular second messenger that regulates processes like smooth muscle relaxation and vision; it is not the food additive E626 (5'-GMP) used as a flavor enhancer.",

    {
      "q": "how to increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate",
      "a": "Increasing cGMP is a physiological/medical matter (e.g., via phosphodiesterase inhibition) and is unrelated to food additives; eating E626 (5'-GMP) will not raise cGMP levels.",

      "q": "how to tell a true seth thomas e626-000",
      "a": "That appears to be a clock model designation and is unrelated to E-number additives; in foods, E626 refers to guanylic acid (5'-GMP), a flavor enhancer.",

      "q": "what is cyclic guanosine monophosphate",
      "a": "cGMP is the cyclic form of guanosine monophosphate used by cells as a signaling molecule; it is distinct from E626, which is 5'-GMP used in foods to enhance umami.",

    {
      "q": "what is e626 guanylic acid",
      "a": "E626 (guanylic acid, 5'-GMP) is a nucleotide flavor enhancer, typically made by microbial fermentation, that boosts umami; its salts E627â€“E629 are often used with MSG/inosinate for synergy.",
