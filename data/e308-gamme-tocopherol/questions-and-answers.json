      "q": "what is d gamma tocopherol",
      "a": "d‑γ‑tocopherol is the naturally occurring stereoisomer of gamma‑tocopherol, a vitamin E compound used as the antioxidant food additive E308, typically derived from vegetable oils or produced synthetically.",

    {
      "q": "why is e308 infinity",
      "a": "If you mean the food additive code E308, “infinity” doesn’t apply—it refers to gamma‑tocopherol, an antioxidant; you may be thinking of scientific notation where “E308” means ×10^308 in calculators, which is unrelated.",

    {
      "q": "10 mg gamma tocopherol is how many iu",
      "a": "There’s no direct IU conversion for γ‑tocopherol because vitamin E IUs are defined for α‑tocopherol activity; some older systems counted γ‑tocopherol as ~0.1 mg α‑TE per mg, but modern labeling generally does not convert it to IU.",

    {
      "q": "beta gamma tocopherol standard what is normal range",
      "a": "There is no single regulatory “normal range” for β‑ or γ‑tocopherol as food additives—specifications vary by manufacturer and use; in clinical testing, reference intervals for blood levels also vary by lab, and nutrition labeling typically counts only α‑tocopherol.",

    {
      "q": "crusaders of the lost idol how to get past the e308 cap",
      "a": "That refers to a video‑game notation (~10^308) and isn’t related to the food additive E308; in foods, E308 simply denotes γ‑tocopherol used as an antioxidant.",
