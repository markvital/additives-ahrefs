  "description": "Butylated hydroxytoluene -BHT-, also known as dibutylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties. European and U.S. regulations allow small amounts to be used as a food additive. In addition to this use, BHT is widely used to prevent oxidation in fluids -e.g. fuel, oil- and other materials where free radicals must be controlled.",
