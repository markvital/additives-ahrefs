  "description": "Potassium benzoate -E212-, the potassium salt of benzoic acid, is a food preservative that inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It works best in low-pH products, below 4.5, where it exists as benzoic acid.  Acidic foods and beverages such as fruit juice -citric acid-, sparkling drinks -carbonic acid-, soft drinks -phosphoric acid-, pickles -vinegar-, and frogurt toppings may be preserved with potassium benzoate. It is approved for use in most countries including Canada, the U.S., and the EU, where it is designated by the E number E212. Potassium benzoate is also used in the whistle in many fireworks.",
