      "q": "is calcium hydroxide a strong base",
      "a": "Yes—calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is a strong base; although only moderately soluble, its saturated solution (limewater) is highly alkaline (pH around 12.4).",

      "q": "what is calcium hydroxide used for",
      "a": "In foods it’s used as an acidity regulator and firming agent—commonly for nixtamalizing corn (masa/tortillas), as pickling lime to keep cucumbers crisp, and in sugar refining; it’s also used to adjust brewing water pH.",

    {
      "q": "is calcium hydroxide bad for you",
      "a": "At the small amounts used in foods it isn’t considered harmful and is permitted (e.g., FDA GRAS; EU E526) under good manufacturing practice. Concentrated powders or solutions are caustic and can burn or irritate skin, eyes, and the digestive tract.",

    {
      "q": "is calcium hydroxide safe to eat",
      "a": "Yes, when food‑grade and used at normal levels it’s considered safe; residual amounts in treated foods are low and can contribute calcium. Avoid ingesting concentrated forms, which are corrosive.",

    {
      "q": "how to make calcium hydroxide",
      "a": "Industrial food‑grade calcium hydroxide is made by hydrating calcium oxide (quicklime), which is produced by calcining limestone; CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2. For safety and purity, use commercially prepared food‑grade pickling lime rather than attempting to make it at home, as the reaction is caustic and highly exothermic.",
