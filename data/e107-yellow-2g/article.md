Yellow 2G (E107) is a synthetic yellow food color that was once used to brighten sweets, drinks, and other processed foods. Today it is not commonly seen because major markets like the European Union and the United States do not authorize it for use in food.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic yellow coloring (also called E107).
- Status: not approved in the United States and not on the European Union’s list of permitted food colors.
- Where you might see it: rarely on modern ingredient lists; more likely in older references or products from regions with different rules.
- Common replacements: [curcumin](/e100-curcumin), [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine), [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf), [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin), [carotene](/e160a-carotene), [lutein](/e161b-lutein), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red), or [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins).

## Why is Yellow 2G added to food?
Food makers add colors to make products look consistent and appealing. Uniform color can signal flavor or freshness and helps keep multi-batch products looking the same from package to package.

## What foods contain Yellow 2G?
In places where it was once permitted, Yellow 2G appeared in candies, soft drinks, desserts, and flavored snacks. In the European Union it is not included in the Union list of authorized food additives, and therefore may not be used in foods placed on the EU market.[^1][^2] In the United States, Yellow 2G is not on FDA’s list of color additives permitted for use in foods.[^3]

## What can replace Yellow 2G?
Depending on the product and shade needed, manufacturers often turn to:
- Natural or nature‑identical yellows such as [curcumin](/e100-curcumin), [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin), [carotene](/e160a-carotene), [lutein](/e161b-lutein), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract).
- Other permitted synthetic yellows where allowed, including [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) or [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf).
- For warmer or red‑orange hues, [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) or [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) may be blended.

The best replacement depends on pH, light/heat stability, and whether a “natural colors only” label is required.

## How is Yellow 2G made?
Yellow 2G is produced by chemical synthesis. Like most synthetic food colors, production focuses on achieving a consistent shade and high purity. Where food colors are authorized, they must meet detailed identity and purity specifications issued by regulators; however, the EU does not publish specifications for Yellow 2G because it is not on the Union list.[^2]

## Is Yellow 2G safe to eat?
Safety assessments for food colors are tied to regulatory approvals. In the European Union, only additives included in the Union list in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 may be used in food, and Yellow 2G is not on that list.[^1] The corresponding EU specifications document (Regulation (EU) No 231/2012) does not include Yellow 2G, reflecting its non‑authorization.[^2] In the United States, the FDA permits only color additives listed in its regulations; Yellow 2G is not among the approved food colors.[^3] If you live outside these regions, check your national rules.

## Does Yellow 2G have any benefits?
Yellow 2G has no nutritional benefits. Its role is purely cosmetic—providing a bright, stable yellow shade that helps products look appealing and consistent.

## Who should avoid Yellow 2G?
- Shoppers in the EU and US typically won’t encounter it in foods because it is not authorized there.[^1][^3]
- Anyone choosing to avoid artificial colors would naturally avoid Yellow 2G.
- If you have colorant sensitivities, discuss ingredient choices with a healthcare professional and check labels on imported goods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “An E‑number means an additive is harmful.”  
  Fact: E‑numbers are simply codes used in Europe to identify food additives. Only additives on the Union list are authorized for use; some substances with historical E‑numbers are no longer permitted.[^4][^1]
- Myth: “Yellow 2G is the same as Yellow 5.”  
  Fact: They are different. “Yellow 5” is FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine, E102), which is a separately regulated color additive in the US and EU.[^3]

## Yellow 2G in branded foods
Current mainstream products in the EU and US do not list Yellow 2G because it is not authorized there.[^1][^3] If you see it on an imported label, verify that the product complies with your country’s regulations.
