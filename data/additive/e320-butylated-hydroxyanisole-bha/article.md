Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), also labeled as E320, is a synthetic antioxidant used to keep fats and oils from going rancid. It helps protect flavor, color, and texture in many shelf‑stable foods. You will usually see it listed as “BHA” or “E320” on ingredient labels.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic antioxidant that protects fats and oils
- E-number: E320; also called BHA or butylated hydroxyanisole
- What it does: slows oxidation to prevent rancidity and off‑flavors
- Typical foods: snacks, baked goods, breakfast cereals, processed meats, chewing gum, and products with added fats or oils
- How it’s made: industrially by adding a tert‑butyl group to hydroxyanisole, producing a mixture of two isomers
- Dietary notes: made by chemical synthesis; not derived from animal sources
- Label reading: look for “BHA,” “butylated hydroxyanisole,” or “E320”

## Why is Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) added to food?
BHA slows oxidation, the chemical process that turns fats rancid and leads to stale flavors and odors. By protecting oils and fat‑rich ingredients, it helps keep foods stable during storage and transport, and can also help preserve flavors and colors that are sensitive to air.[^1]

## What foods contain Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha)?
You may find BHA in foods that contain added fats or oils, where even small amounts can help prevent rancidity. Examples include:
- Snack foods and baked goods with added fats
- Breakfast cereals
- Processed meats and meat seasonings
- Chewing gum
- Shortenings, margarine, and other fat‑rich ingredients

In the United States, regulations allow BHA to be added as an antioxidant, with strict limits on how much may be used relative to the fat or oil in the food.[^1]

## What can replace Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha)?
Food makers can choose other antioxidants, depending on the recipe and local rules. Common options include:
- Other synthetic antioxidants such as [butylated hydroxytoluene](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}, and [tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive}  
- “Natural‑type” antioxidants like [tocopherol‑rich extract (vitamin E)](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive} or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive}  
- Synergists that help antioxidants work better, such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive}, [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate){.additive}, or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}

The best choice depends on flavor impact, cost, labeling goals, and how the food is processed.

## How is Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) made?
Commercial BHA is produced by reacting 4‑methoxyphenol (also called p‑hydroxyanisole) with isobutylene or tert‑butanol under acidic conditions. This creates a mixture of two isomers: 3‑tert‑butyl‑4‑methoxyphenol and 2‑tert‑butyl‑4‑methoxyphenol, which together are sold as BHA.[^2]

## Is Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. and EU permit BHA in foods within defined limits. In the United States, the total amount of antioxidant (BHA alone or combined with certain others) may not exceed 0.02% of the fat or oil content in the food.[^1] In Europe, BHA (E320) is authorized as a food additive under the EU food additives regulation, with maximum levels set by food category.[^3]

Safety reviews look at many studies, including long‑term animal tests. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B), based mainly on high‑dose studies in rodents; this classification does not prove a cancer effect in people at dietary levels.[^4] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated BHA and set a health‑based guidance value known as an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), which helps regulators compare estimated intakes with levels considered safe.[^5] ADI means the amount that can be consumed every day over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) have any benefits?
For food, the benefit is shelf‑life and quality: BHA helps keep fats stable, protects flavors, and reduces waste from spoilage.[^1] It can also help maintain the taste and aroma of seasonings and fat‑containing mixes during storage.[^1]

## Who should avoid Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha)?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic antioxidants for personal or dietary reasons can choose products that use alternatives like [tocopherol‑rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive} or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive}.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit certain additives should read labels and follow that guidance.

As with any ingredient, if you suspect sensitivity, discuss it with a healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- “BHA is banned in the EU.”  
  No. BHA (E320) is authorized in the EU as a food additive, with specific maximum levels by food category.[^3]
- “Any amount of BHA causes cancer.”  
  No. IARC’s Group 2B classification means “possibly carcinogenic,” based largely on high‑dose animal data; it is not a finding of cancer in people at normal dietary exposures.[^4]
- “Natural antioxidants are always better.”  
  Not necessarily. “Natural‑type” options like [tocopherol‑rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive} or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive} can work well in some foods, while synthetic options like [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}, or [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive} may be more effective or neutral in taste in others; performance depends on the food and process.

## Butylated hydroxyanisole (bha) in branded foods
On labels, look for “butylated hydroxyanisole,” “BHA,” or “E320,” often near the fats or oils in the ingredient list. Many shelf‑stable items, especially those with added fats, may use it to help keep flavors fresh.
