Stannous chloride (E512) is a food additive made from tin and chlorine. It acts as an antioxidant, which means it helps slow down reactions with oxygen that can dull color or affect flavor. Its use in food is limited and fairly uncommon today in many markets.

## At a glance
- What it is: An inorganic salt of tin, also called tin(II) chloride or “stannous” chloride.
- What it does: Works as an antioxidant and color protector in some processed foods.
- Where you might see it: Occasionally on labels for canned or bottled foods, mainly in the EU.
- Label names: “Stannous chloride,” “tin(II) chloride,” or “E512.”
- Diet notes: Not made from animal products; typically used at very low levels.
- Taste/texture: Not used for flavor; its role is purely technological.

## Why is Stannous chloride added to food?
Food makers use stannous chloride to slow down oxidation, the chemical reaction with oxygen that can lead to browning, color loss, or off-flavors. In EU rules, it is listed in the antioxidant class of additives, meaning its purpose is to help keep foods stable during processing and shelf life.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Stannous chloride?
You may find E512 on the ingredient lists of some canned or bottled foods—especially items where color and flavor stability matter—though its use is not widespread. In the European Union, it is an approved food additive, so its use is limited to certain food categories and set maximum levels where applicable.[^2]

## What can replace Stannous chloride?
Depending on the recipe, food makers often choose other antioxidants or processing aids, such as:
- Ascorbates like [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} or [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate){.additive}
- [Erythorbic acid](/e315-erythorbic-acid){.additive}
- Organic acids and chelators such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate){.additive}
- Phenolic antioxidants like [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, or [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive}
- Sulfites where legally allowed and labeled, such as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide){.additive} or [sodium metabisulphite](/e223-sodium-metabisulphite){.additive}

The best substitute depends on the food’s pH, fat content, color needs, and labeling goals.

## How is Stannous chloride made?
Industrially, stannous chloride is commonly produced by reacting metallic tin with hydrochloric acid, forming tin(II) chloride (often first as a dihydrate) that can then be purified and, if needed, dehydrated. It appears as a white to off-white crystalline solid and dissolves readily in water.[^4]

## Is Stannous chloride safe to eat?
In the European Union, stannous chloride (E512) is authorized as a food additive, meaning its uses and any limits are set by law after a safety review.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has re-evaluated E512 as part of the EU’s additive review program and did not identify safety concerns at the currently authorized uses and use levels.[^3] As with any additive, actual exposure from foods is expected to be low because only small amounts are used for its antioxidant effect.[^3]

It’s worth noting that inorganic tin can also come from can materials, which is handled under separate regulations for contaminants; limits exist in the EU to control tin levels in canned foods.[^5] Those limits are separate from, and in addition to, the rules that govern E512 as an additive.[^2][^5]

## Does Stannous chloride have any benefits?
Its benefits are technological: it helps protect color and slows oxidation during processing and storage. This can help some foods keep their intended appearance and quality for longer. It is not used as a nutrient.

## Who should avoid Stannous chloride?
- People advised by their healthcare professional to avoid tin compounds should read labels and choose products accordingly.
- Anyone who has noticed sensitivity to canned foods with high inorganic tin levels may wish to be cautious and follow medical advice; this is distinct from the small, controlled amounts of E512 used as an additive.[^5]

If you have questions about specific health conditions, check with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All tin additives are unsafe.” Fact: Safety depends on the compound, the dose, and how it’s used. E512 is authorized in the EU with specific conditions.[^2]
- Myth: “E512 is the same as tin leaching from cans.” Fact: E512 is a defined additive with purity criteria; rules for tin as a contaminant in canned foods are separate and include strict limits.[^1][^5]
- Myth: “It adds flavor.” Fact: Stannous chloride is used for its antioxidant function, not for taste.

## Stannous chloride in branded foods
E512 is not a common sight on everyday labels, but it may appear on some canned or bottled items in regions where it is authorized. Look for “stannous chloride,” “tin(II) chloride,” or “E512” in the ingredient list. If you want to avoid it, choosing fresh, frozen, or products without added antioxidants is a simple approach.
