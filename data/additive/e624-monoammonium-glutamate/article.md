Monoammonium glutamate (E624) is a flavor enhancer from the glutamates family. It gives a savory umami taste like MSG, but without adding sodium. In the EU it is regulated and allowed in many savory foods within set limits.

## At a glance
- What it is: the ammonium salt of L-glutamic acid (an umami-tasting amino acid)
- Role in food: flavor enhancer for savory/umami notes
- Also called: E624, monoammonium L-glutamate
- Typical uses: snack seasonings, soups, instant noodles, sauces, cured meats, and ready meals
- How it’s made: fermentation to produce L-glutamic acid, then neutralized with ammonia to form the ammonium salt
- On labels: “monoammonium glutamate” or “E624”
- ADI (acceptable daily intake): 30 mg/kg body weight per day, expressed as glutamic acid (group ADI for E620–E625; see details below)

## Why is monoammonium glutamate added to food?
Food makers use E624 to boost umami—the deep, savory taste found in broths, meats, and aged cheeses. A small amount can make soups, sauces, and snacks taste richer and more rounded. In the EU, monoammonium glutamate is part of the “glutamates” group (E620–E625) used as flavor enhancers.[^1]

## What foods contain monoammonium glutamate?
You’ll most often see glutamates in savory processed foods: bouillon and instant soups, snack seasonings, cured or cooked meats, sauces, and ready meals. Exact use levels depend on the food type and local rules. In 2020, the EU revised and generally lowered the maximum permitted levels for glutamates (E620–E625) across many food categories.[^2]

## What can replace monoammonium glutamate?
Depending on the recipe, these can serve a similar role:
- Other glutamates: [glutamic acid](/e620-glutamic-acid){.additive}, [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}, [monopotassium glutamate](/e622-monopotassium-glutamate){.additive}, [calcium diglutamate](/e623-calcium-diglutamate){.additive}, [magnesium diglutamate](/e625-magnesium-diglutamate){.additive}
- 5′-ribonucleotides: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate){.additive}, [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive}, or their blend [disodium 5′-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide){.additive}
- Umami-rich ingredients: yeast extract, mushroom or tomato concentrates, aged cheeses, fermented sauces
- For salt reduction strategies: [potassium chloride](/e508-potassium-chloride){.additive}, sometimes paired with glutamates

## How is monoammonium glutamate made?
Most commercial glutamates begin with fermentation: selected food-grade microorganisms turn sugars (from sources like molasses or starch hydrolysates) into L-glutamic acid. The purified L-glutamic acid is then neutralized with a food-grade ammonium source to form monoammonium glutamate. The EU also sets identity and purity specifications for glutamic acid and its salts (E620–E625).[^3]

## Is monoammonium glutamate safe to eat?
In 2017, EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) set a group ADI of 30 mg/kg body weight per day for glutamic acid and its salts (E620–E625), expressed as glutamic acid. EFSA also estimated that some people—especially children with high intakes of many foods containing added glutamates—could exceed this ADI, which led to calls for lower maximum use levels.[^1] The EU later adjusted permitted levels for glutamates in several food categories.[^2]

## Does monoammonium glutamate have any benefits?
- Flavor impact: E624 provides a clean umami boost that can make foods taste fuller and more savory.
- Sodium management: Using glutamates to replace part of the added salt can help reduce sodium while keeping flavor—MSG, for example, contains much less sodium than table salt and can enable notable sodium cuts in some foods.[^4] Monoammonium glutamate itself contains no sodium.

## Who should avoid monoammonium glutamate?
- People who notice they are sensitive to glutamate additives may prefer to avoid them. If you choose to limit intake, check ingredient lists for “monoammonium glutamate,” “glutamate,” or “E624.”
- Those aiming to stay below the EFSA ADI should limit frequent, high portions of multiple foods with added glutamates, especially for young children within the household.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It always adds sodium.” Fact: Monoammonium glutamate contains ammonium, not sodium. Other glutamates can contain potassium, calcium, or magnesium instead of sodium.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s purely synthetic.” Fact: Food-grade glutamates are commonly made by fermentation of carbohydrates, then converted to the desired salt.[^3]
- Myth: “It can’t help with sodium reduction.” Fact: Glutamates can let manufacturers replace part of salt while keeping taste; MSG has far less sodium than table salt and is used this way.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s banned in the EU.” Fact: It is regulated in the EU with official specifications and use limits (E620–E625).[^3]

## Monoammonium glutamate in branded foods
On labels, look for “monoammonium glutamate,” “ammonium glutamate,” or “E624,” often grouped under “flavor enhancer.” It appears less often than MSG but may be used in snack seasonings, instant soups and noodles, sauces, and some meat products. Availability varies by market and by brand’s flavor strategy.
