  "description": "Ammonia solution, also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide , ammoniacal liquor, ammonia liquor, aqua ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or -inaccurately- ammonia, is a solution of ammonia in water. It can be denoted by the symbols NH3-aq-.  Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition [NH4+][OH−], it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH4+ and OH− do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.",
