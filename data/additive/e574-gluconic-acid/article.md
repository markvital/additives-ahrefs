Gluconic acid (E574) is a mild, clean-tasting organic acid made by oxidizing glucose, often through fermentation. Food makers use it to control acidity and to bind trace metals that can dull flavor or color in foods and drinks.

## At a glance
- Names: Gluconic acid, D‑gluconic acid, E574
- What it does: Gentle acidity regulator and metal chelator (sequestrant)
- Where it’s used: Drinks, sauces, confectionery, dairy-style products, and many other processed foods
- How it’s made: Commonly produced by fermenting glucose, then purified
- Label reading: Look for “gluconic acid” or “E574”
- Taste: Softer than sharper acids like citric; does not add a strong sour bite

## Why is Gluconic acid added to food?
Gluconic acid helps set and hold a target pH (acidity), which supports flavor balance, texture, and shelf stability. It also binds trace metals such as iron and copper, helping prevent discoloration and off‑tastes in products like beverages and syrups.[^1]

## What foods contain Gluconic acid?
You’ll mostly see E574 in:
- Non‑alcoholic beverages and flavored waters
- Jams, jellies, confectionery, and dessert toppings
- Sauces, dressings, pickled or marinated items
- Dairy-style and plant-based products

In the EU, gluconic acid is authorized in a wide range of categories under the “quantum satis” principle (use as much as needed for the effect), which is why it appears across many processed foods.[^2] To check if it’s in a product, read the ingredients list for “gluconic acid” or “E574.”

## What can replace Gluconic acid?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- To adjust acidity: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- To bind metals (sequestration): calcium disodium EDTA ([e385](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate)) in products where allowed

Each acid has a different sourness profile, so flavor and usage levels will vary. EDTA is a much stronger chelator than gluconic acid, but its uses are more restricted.

## How is Gluconic acid made?
Gluconic acid is typically produced by fermenting glucose with microorganisms (for example, Aspergillus niger or Acetobacter/Gluconobacter species), followed by filtration and purification.[^3] It can also be made by oxidation of D‑glucose, reflecting the fact that gluconic acid is the oxidation product of glucose.[^4]

## Is Gluconic acid safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated gluconic acid and related gluconates (E574–E579) and concluded there is no safety concern at current authorized uses and levels.[^2] In the EU, it must also meet established identity and purity specifications before use in food.[^1]

## Does Gluconic acid have any benefits?
For food makers, its main benefits are technical: it provides gentle, stable acidity and helps keep products clear and fresh‑tasting by tying up trace metals that can cause haze or off‑flavors.[^3] Because its sourness is mild, it can fine‑tune pH without making foods taste sharply acidic.

## Who should avoid Gluconic acid?
Most people don’t need to avoid E574. Those who are sensitive to acidic foods or managing reflux may choose to limit acidic ingredients generally. If you have a specific medical diet, follow your healthcare professional’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Gluconic acid is the same as citric acid.” Fact: Both are food acids, but they differ in taste and strength; gluconic acid is milder.
- Myth: “It’s only a preservative.” Fact: Its primary roles are pH control and metal chelation; it is not a stand‑alone antimicrobial.
- Myth: “Gluconic acid and glucono delta‑lactone (GDL) are identical.” Fact: GDL is a related compound that slowly converts to gluconic acid in water; labels will list them separately when used.

## Gluconic acid in branded foods
You’ll find E574 on ingredient lists as “gluconic acid” or “E574.” It often appears alongside other acids or stabilizers. If you want to compare products, check the acidity regulators and sequestrants listed on the label rather than relying on taste alone.
