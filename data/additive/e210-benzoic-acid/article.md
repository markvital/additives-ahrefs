Benzoic acid (E210) is a preservative used to help keep acidic foods and drinks safe and fresh by slowing the growth of yeasts, molds, and some bacteria. It occurs naturally in small amounts in some berries and fermented foods, and is also made for food use under strict purity standards.

## At a glance
Benzoic acid is a common preservative for acidic foods and beverages.

- E-number: E210; function: preservative
- Works best at low pH (acidic foods and drinks)
- Found in soft drinks, fruit products, pickles, sauces, and dressings
- On labels you might see: “benzoic acid” or “E210”
- Related salts include [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), [potassium benzoate](/e212-potassium-benzoate), and [calcium benzoate](/e213-calcium-benzoate)

## Why is Benzoic acid added to food?
Benzoic acid helps prevent spoilage by inhibiting yeasts, molds, and some bacteria, especially in acidic foods and beverages. In low-pH conditions, more of the acid is in its “undissociated” form, which can pass into microbial cells and disrupt their normal functions, slowing growth and extending shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain Benzoic acid?
You’ll most often find benzoic acid in acidic products such as soft drinks, flavored waters, fruit juices and syrups, jams and jellies, pickles and relishes, salad dressings, and some sauces. EU rules authorize benzoic acid and benzoates in a range of food categories, with specific limits depending on the product type.[^2] Benzoic acid can also occur naturally in certain berries (like cranberries) and can form in some fermented dairy foods.[^3]

## What can replace Benzoic acid?
Depending on the food and the goal, manufacturers may use:
- Related benzoates: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), [potassium benzoate](/e212-potassium-benzoate), [calcium benzoate](/e213-calcium-benzoate)
- Sorbates for similar antimicrobial action: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- Acidification to keep pH low: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- Other targeted preservatives in certain foods: [nisin](/e234-nisin), [natamycin](/e235-natamycin)
- Packaging and process options (e.g., carbonation with [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide), refrigeration, pasteurization)

## How is Benzoic acid made?
Food-grade benzoic acid used in the EU must meet official identity and purity specifications; it is produced by chemical synthesis and refined to food-grade quality.[^4] It is also naturally present in some plants and may appear in small amounts in fermented foods due to microbial activity.[^3]

## Is Benzoic acid safe to eat?
In the EU, benzoic acid (E210) and benzoates have an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as benzoic acid.[^1] In the United States, benzoic acid is listed by the FDA among substances permitted for use in foods, subject to good manufacturing practice and applicable regulations.[^5]

A special note for beverages: under certain conditions (presence of benzoate plus vitamin C, heat/light, and trace metals), small amounts of benzene can form. The FDA has monitored this issue; manufacturers reformulate when needed, and levels found in the marketplace have generally been low.[^6]

## Does Benzoic acid have any benefits?
Using benzoic acid can make acidic foods and drinks last longer and taste fresher by slowing spoilage, which can help reduce food waste. Its antimicrobial effect is most pronounced in products with a low pH (typically below about 4.5), where it is most active against yeasts and molds.[^3]

## Who should avoid Benzoic acid?
Products for infants and young children have stricter additive rules in the EU, and benzoates are generally not authorized in these foods. Caregivers should check labels on baby and toddler products and follow local guidance.[^2] If a healthcare professional has advised you to avoid benzoates, look for “benzoic acid,” “E210,” or related benzoates (E211–E213) on ingredient lists.

## Myths & facts
- “Benzoic acid in soda always turns into benzene.” Fact: Benzene can form only under specific conditions (benzoate plus vitamin C, heat/light, and certain metals), and FDA oversight has kept levels low in the marketplace.[^6]
- “It’s purely synthetic.” Fact: It also occurs naturally in some berries and fermented foods, though commercial food use relies on purified, food-grade material.[^3]
- “An E-number means unsafe.” Fact: E-numbers are simply the EU’s code for additives that have been evaluated and authorized for specific uses.[^2]

## Benzoic acid in branded foods
On labels, benzoic acid usually appears as “benzoic acid” or “E210.” It is common in ingredient lists for acidic soft drinks, fruit-flavored beverages and syrups, pickles and relish, jams and jellies, and some sauces and dressings. If you prefer to avoid it, scan the ingredient list for “benzoic acid,” “E210,” or consider products preserved with alternatives such as [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), when appropriate for the food.
