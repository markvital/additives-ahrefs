Calcium diglutamate (E623) is a flavor enhancer that boosts savory, umami taste in foods. It works much like monosodium glutamate (MSG) but uses calcium instead of sodium. You’ll find it in seasonings, soups, sauces, and snack foods in some regions.

## At a glance
This additive belongs to the glutamate family and is used to make foods taste more savory.

- Role: Flavor enhancer (umami)
- Also called: E623, calcium diglutamate
- Typical foods: Seasoning mixes, soups and broths, sauces, instant noodles, savory snacks
- Common pairs: Sometimes used alongside other flavor enhancers like [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) and [disodium 5′-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide)
- Label check: Look for “E623,” “calcium diglutamate,” or “flavor enhancer”

## Why is Calcium diglutamate added to food?
Food makers add calcium diglutamate to sharpen and round out savory (umami) flavors. It can make soups, sauces, snacks, and ready meals taste richer without changing the original recipe much. Because the active taste is the glutamate part, it provides a similar flavor effect to [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) while contributing calcium instead of sodium.

## What foods contain Calcium diglutamate?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Dry seasoning blends and bouillon
- Soups, sauces, and gravies
- Instant noodles and rice dishes
- Savory snacks and coated meats

In the European Union, calcium diglutamate (E623) is an authorized food additive (flavor enhancer) and may be used in a range of processed foods according to additive rules and category limits set by EU law.[^3]

## What can replace Calcium diglutamate?
Alternatives that deliver a similar savory effect include:
- Other glutamate salts: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) and [monopotassium glutamate](/e622-monopotassium-glutamate)
- Ribonucleotide enhancers: [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), or blends like [disodium 5′-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide)
- Ingredient-based umami sources: yeast extract, mushroom concentrates, tomato paste, seaweed (kombu), and long-simmered stocks

## How is Calcium diglutamate made?
The starting point is L‑glutamic acid, the naturally occurring amino acid that carries the umami taste. In modern production, L‑glutamic acid is typically made by microbial fermentation of sugars, then purified.[^2] Calcium diglutamate is then produced by neutralizing L‑glutamic acid with a food‑grade calcium base to form the calcium salt, meeting purity and identity specifications set in EU additive standards.[^1]

## Is Calcium diglutamate safe to eat?
Safety has been assessed as part of the glutamates group (E620–E625). In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as glutamic acid. EFSA also noted that some people, especially children with high intakes of processed foods, could exceed this ADI and recommended lowering maximum permitted levels in some categories.[^2] Within the EU, its use is regulated under the general food additive framework, which sets where and how much may be added.[^3]

## Does Calcium diglutamate have any benefits?
- It strengthens savory flavor at low use levels, helping recipes taste fuller and more consistent from batch to batch.
- Because it is the calcium salt, it can provide umami without adding sodium from the additive itself, which may help in reduced‑sodium formulations.[^1]

## Who should avoid Calcium diglutamate?
Most people can consume foods with added glutamates without issues. A small number of individuals report short‑lived symptoms (sometimes called “MSG symptom complex,” such as headache or flushing) after large amounts, but controlled studies have not found consistent reactions in the general population.[^4] As with many flavor enhancers, parents who wish to limit highly seasoned or ultra‑processed foods for young children may choose to check labels and moderate intake.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Calcium diglutamate is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are different salts (calcium vs. sodium), but both release glutamate, which is what produces the umami taste.
- Myth: “It always causes headaches.” Fact: Sensitive individuals may report symptoms, but research reviewed by the U.S. FDA has not shown consistent effects across the general population.[^4]
- Myth: “It adds a lot of sodium.” Fact: Calcium diglutamate contains calcium, not sodium, so the additive itself does not add sodium to the recipe.[^1]

## Calcium diglutamate in branded foods
On labels, look for “calcium diglutamate,” “E623,” or “flavor enhancer.” It appears most often in savory seasonings, instant soups and noodles, bouillon cubes, sauces, snack coatings, and some ready meals. If you prefer to avoid it, choose products labeled “no added flavor enhancers” or use simpler ingredient lists, and season at home with herbs, spices, and natural umami sources.
