Potassium metabisulphite (E224) is a sulphite-based preservative and antioxidant used to keep foods and drinks fresh. It releases small amounts of sulphur dioxide that slow browning and help control unwanted microbes in products like wine, fruit products, and some soft drinks.

## At a glance
- What it is: A sulphite salt used as a preservative and antioxidant (also called potassium metabisulfite).
- What it does: Controls microbes, prevents oxidation and browning, stabilizes flavor and color in foods and drinks.
- Where it’s found: Common in wines and ciders, dried fruits, fruit juices/concentrates, syrups, and pickled products.
- E-number: E224 (European Union).
- Typical label names: “Potassium metabisulphite,” “Potassium metabisulfite,” “E224,” or “sulphites/sulfites.”

## Why is Potassium metabisulphite added to food?
Food makers use E224 because it protects foods in two ways: it suppresses the growth of certain bacteria and yeasts, and it slows oxidation that leads to browning and stale flavors. In solution it forms bisulphite/sulphite ions and releases traces of sulphur dioxide, which deliver the preservative effect.[^1]

Winemakers rely on it to keep wine stable during production and storage. It helps preserve aroma and color and reduces the risk of spoilage organisms taking hold.[^1]

## What foods contain Potassium metabisulphite?
You’ll most often see E224 in:
- Wines and ciders (and some other fermented beverages)
- Dried fruits (for example, apricots), jams, and fruit preserves
- Fruit juices and concentrates, cordials, and syrups
- Pickles, chutneys, and certain processed vegetable products[^1]

In the United States, many wines must declare “Contains sulfites” when total sulphur dioxide is at or above 10 parts per million (ppm).[^4] More broadly, U.S. food labels must declare added sulfiting agents at 10 ppm or more.[^3]

## What can replace Potassium metabisulphite?
Depending on the food and the goal (antimicrobial vs antioxidant), makers may use:
- Other sulphites: [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide){.additive}, [sodium metabisulphite](/e223-sodium-metabisulphite){.additive}, or [potassium bisulphite](/e228-potassium-bisulphite){.additive}
- Non-sulphite preservatives: [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}, [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive}
- Antioxidants/acidulants: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive}, [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}

Choice depends on taste impact, pH, product type, and local rules.

## How is Potassium metabisulphite made?
Industry prepares E224 by reacting sulphur dioxide with a potassium base (such as potassium carbonate or hydroxide) to form potassium bisulphite, then removing water to yield potassium metabisulphite crystals.[^2]

## Is Potassium metabisulphite safe to eat?
Regulators evaluate sulphites as a group (E220–E228). The current health-based guidance value used by major bodies is an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.7 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as sulphur dioxide. Some high-consuming groups (especially children who eat many sulphite-containing foods) can exceed this level in worst‑case scenarios, so authorities continue to monitor exposure.[^1]

## Does Potassium metabisulphite have any benefits?
For consumers, the benefit is fresher-tasting food and drink with better color and a longer shelf life. In wine, it helps prevent oxidation and controls spoilage microbes so the wine stays stable from bottling to glass.[^1]

## Who should avoid Potassium metabisulphite?
- People with sulphite sensitivity (including a subset of individuals with asthma) may experience wheezing, hives, or other reactions and should avoid sulphites or use medical advice to guide choices.[^5]
- Labeling can help: in the European Union, “sulphur dioxide and sulphites” at 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L (as SO2) or more must be indicated on the label; similar thresholds trigger disclosure in the United States.[^6][^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sulfites are banned.” Fact: Sulphites are permitted in many foods and drinks, but their use is controlled and they must be declared when present at set levels.[^4][^6]
- Myth: “Everyone reacts to sulphites.” Fact: Most people do not. Reactions occur in a small subset of people, especially some with asthma.[^5]
- Myth: “Sulfites are just one chemical.” Fact: They’re a family, including [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide){.additive} and several sodium and potassium salts (E221–E228), such as E224.

## Potassium metabisulphite in branded foods
How to spot it:
- Ingredient list: Look for “potassium metabisulphite,” “potassium metabisulfite,” “E224,” or “sulphites/sulfites.”
- Wine labels (U.S.): Bottles with 10 ppm or more must say “Contains sulfites.”[^4]
- Food labels (U.S.): Added sulfiting agents at 10 ppm or more must be declared on the ingredient list.[^3]
- Food labels (EU): “Sulphur dioxide and sulphites” are mandatory to declare when present at or above 10 mg/kg or 10 mg/L (as SO2).[^6]
