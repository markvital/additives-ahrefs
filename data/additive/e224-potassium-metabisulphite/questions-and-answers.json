      "q": "how much potassium metabisulfite per gallon of wine",

      "q": "how much potassium metabisulfite per gallon of mead",
      "a": "Start with ~0.3 g per US gallon (≈50 ppm as SO2), or 1 Campden tablet per gallon; mead’s typically higher pH may require more to reach the target molecular SO2, and stabilization often also uses potassium sorbate.",

      "q": "is potassium metabisulfite harmful",
      "a": "At permitted food levels it’s generally considered safe, but sulfites can trigger asthma or allergic‑like reactions in sensitive individuals; the powder/solutions are irritating, so avoid inhalation and skin/eye contact.",

      "q": "when to add potassium metabisulfite to wine",
      "a": "Add at crush to limit wild microbes and oxidation, then maintain appropriate free SO2 after fermentation during aging/racking and just before bottling based on pH.",
