Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (often called DATEM) is an emulsifier used mainly in bread and other baked goods. It helps oil and water mix and makes dough stronger, so loaves rise well and keep a soft crumb. In the European Union it is listed as E472e.

## At a glance
This is a quick overview without the technical detail.

- What it is: An emulsifier and dough-strengthener, also known as DATEM (E472e).
- What it does: Helps oil and water mix, strengthens gluten networks in dough, boosts loaf volume, and keeps crumbs softer for longer.
- Where it shows up: Sandwich bread, burger buns, rolls, pastries, coffee creamers, whipped toppings, and some spreads.
- Vegan/vegetarian note: The fatty acids can come from plant or animal fats; many makers use vegetable sources, but you may need to check with the manufacturer.
- Regulation: Approved for use in both the EU and the US at low levels in specific foods.

## Why is Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers use E472e as an emulsifier and stabiliser. In dough, it helps proteins hold gas during proofing and baking, which improves volume and texture. It also keeps fat and water from separating in products like creamers and whipped toppings, improving consistency over shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
You will most often see E472e in yeast‑leavened baked goods and baking mixes (such as sliced bread, burger buns, and rolls). It also appears in non‑dairy creamers, whipped toppings, icings, and certain spreads where stable mixing of fat and water is needed.[^1] In the EU, it is an authorised additive in multiple food categories under the general food additive framework.[^2]

## What can replace Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
It depends on the job it performs in your recipe:
- For emulsifying and dough strengthening: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), or [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate).
- For similar tartaric/acetic ester systems: [tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e472f-mixed-acetic-and-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).
- For general emulsifying: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins).
- For dough handling and softness: enzymes like [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase) or hydrocolloids such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) and [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum). Bakers also often pair emulsifiers with [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) as a dough improver.

## How is Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers start with mono- and diglycerides produced from food‑grade fats and oils. These are reacted with tartaric acid (or its derivatives) and acetic acid (or acetic anhydride) to form the diacetyltartaric acid esters that make up DATEM.[^3] U.S. and EU rules also set identity and purity specifications for this additive to ensure it meets food‑grade standards.[^1][^3]

## Is Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
Within the approved uses and levels, regulators consider E472e safe. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits DATEM for specified uses in foods and sets conditions for its manufacture and purity.[^1] In the European Union, it is an authorised food additive listed under the food additive regulation framework, with detailed specifications laid out separately.[^2][^3]

## Does Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
For bakers and food makers, E472e improves dough tolerance, loaf volume, and crumb softness. For consumers, it helps keep products like bread and creamers consistent and less prone to separating or going stale quickly. Because it is effective at low levels, it can deliver these texture and stability benefits without adding noticeable taste.

## Who should avoid Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Most people do not need to avoid E472e. However:
- If you follow a vegetarian, vegan, halal, or kosher diet, you may wish to confirm the source of the fatty acids (plant vs. animal) with the manufacturer, since the EU specification allows production from edible fats and oils in general.[^3]
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit emulsifiers, check labels and choose products without DATEM.

## Myths & facts
Here are a few common misunderstandings cleared up.
- “DATEM is the same as diacetyl flavor.” False. The name refers to diacetyltartaric acid esters, which are different compounds from the butter‑like flavor chemical diacetyl.
- “It’s a preservative.” Not really. E472e’s main role is emulsifying and dough strengthening; it does not act as an antimicrobial.
- “It’s synthetic and therefore unsafe.” Safety depends on composition, purity, and use level. E472e is made from food‑grade fats and common food acids and is regulated for identity and purity.
- “Bread with DATEM isn’t real bread.” Many traditional breads are made without emulsifiers, but E472e is widely used in large‑scale baking to improve consistency and shelf life.

## Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you will usually see this additive written as “DATEM” or spelled out in full. It is common in mass‑produced sandwich breads, burger buns, and rolls; it also appears in some non‑dairy creamers and whipped toppings. If you’re avoiding it, check the ingredient panel, as recipes can change by brand and over time.
