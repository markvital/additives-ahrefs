Azodicarbonamide (E927a) is a flour treatment agent used in very small amounts to make dough easier to handle and to create bread with a lighter, more even crumb. It is common in industrial baking and appears on labels as azodicarbonamide or E927a, depending on the market.

## At a glance
- What it is: A fast-acting flour “maturing” and bleaching agent used at very low levels.
- What it does: Helps dough hold gas, improves loaf volume, and evens out color for consistent bread.
- Where it’s found: Some packaged sandwich breads, buns, rolls, and flours from large-scale mills.
- Label names: “Azodicarbonamide” or “E927a.”
- Dietary notes: Made by chemical synthesis; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.
- Regulations: Rules vary by country. In the United States, its use in flour is allowed with strict limits.

## Why is Azodicarbonamide added to food?
Bakers use azodicarbonamide to make dough more predictable. It strengthens the dough network so it traps gas better, which helps bread rise evenly. It also lightens the natural pigment in flour, giving a paler crumb that many consumers expect in white bread.

## What foods contain Azodicarbonamide?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Packaged white and wheat sandwich breads
- Hamburger and hot dog buns
- Rolls, bagels, and some flatbreads
- Commercial flour (added at the mill)

Not every baker uses it. If present, it will be listed in the ingredient statement as “azodicarbonamide” or “E927a.”

## What can replace Azodicarbonamide?
Bakers who avoid azodicarbonamide often combine other dough improvers to get similar results, for example:
- Oxidizing agents such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid)
- Enzymes like [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase) or [lipase](/e1104-lipase)
- Amino acids such as [L-cysteine](/e920-l-cysteine)
- Oxidants such as [calcium peroxide](/e930-calcium-peroxide)
- Emulsifiers including [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Texture aids like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)

Each option behaves a bit differently, so the right blend depends on the flour and the bread style.

## How is Azodicarbonamide made?
Azodicarbonamide is produced by chemical synthesis and sold as a fine, food-grade powder. In practice, millers blend tiny amounts into flour, and bakeries use that treated flour to make dough at scale. In the United States, food-grade azodicarbonamide may be used in flour only under specific conditions and at very low maximum levels set by regulation.[^1] It is also known in chemistry and manufacturing for uses outside food, which reflects its physical properties rather than food-specific function.[^2]

## Is Azodicarbonamide safe to eat?
Safety rules depend on jurisdiction. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits azodicarbonamide as a direct food additive in flour within strict limits and with defined conditions of use.[^1] This regulation specifies how it may be used and the maximum amount that can be added to flour.

## Does Azodicarbonamide have any benefits?
For bakers, the additive improves dough handling, gives more consistent loaf volume, and helps standardize the color of white breads. These technical benefits are most useful in high-speed, large-scale bread production where uniformity matters.

## Who should avoid Azodicarbonamide?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic additives for personal or dietary reasons.
- Shoppers following “clean label” buying habits.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to reduce exposure to specific dough improvers.

If you want to avoid it, scan the ingredient list for “azodicarbonamide” or “E927a.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s a ‘yoga mat chemical,’ so it can’t be safe.”  
  Fact: Many substances have more than one use. The same chemical properties that make azodicarbonamide useful in manufacturing also make it a reliable dough improver. Food rules limit how much can go into flour, and those limits are set by regulators.[^1][^2]

- Myth: “If it’s listed on the label, the bread is full of it.”  
  Fact: Regulations cap its level in flour at very small amounts, and bakeries use it to achieve consistent dough performance.[^1]

- Myth: “All countries treat it the same way.”  
  Fact: Regulations differ by country. Always check local rules and product labels.

## Azodicarbonamide in branded foods
- How to spot it: Look for “azodicarbonamide” or “E927a” in the ingredient list on breads, buns, rolls, and similar items.
- What if you want to avoid it: Choose products that highlight “no dough conditioners,” “no added bleaching agents,” or that use alternatives such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or enzymes like [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase).
- Ask the maker: If the label isn’t clear, most brands will confirm the presence or absence of azodicarbonamide through customer service.
