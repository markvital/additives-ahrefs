Carnauba wax (E903) is a hard, natural wax from the leaves of the carnauba palm. Food makers use it as a glazing and anti-stick coating to give shine and protect foods during storage and transport. It also appears on some tablet and supplement coatings to help them swallow more easily.

## At a glance
Carnauba wax is a plant-derived glazing agent used to protect and polish foods.

- What it is: A natural wax from the carnauba palm (Copernicia prunifera)
- What it does: Adds gloss, reduces sticking, and forms a moisture barrier
- Common uses: Coated sweets, chewing gum, chocolate dragées, and tablet coatings
- Dietary notes: Plant-based; suitable for vegetarians and vegans when used on its own
- Regulatory status: Authorized as a food additive in the EU and used in the U.S. within set rules

## Why is Carnauba wax added to food?
Carnauba wax is mainly used to make surfaces smooth and shiny, and to keep foods from sticking to each other or to equipment. In practice, it helps polish candy shells, protect chocolate dragées, and keep chewing gum from clumping. It also forms a thin barrier that slows moisture loss and surface scuffing during handling and transport. In the EU, E903 is authorized as a glazing agent, a functional class defined in the food additives law.[^2]

## What foods contain Carnauba wax?
You’ll most often see carnauba wax on the label of coated candies, chocolate dragées, and chewing gum. In the U.S., it is one of the waxes allowed in chewing gum base.[^3] Outside of foods, it is commonly used as an approved inactive coating in oral tablets and capsules to aid processing and swallowing.[^4] In the EU, E903 is permitted as a glazing agent across several food categories under the general food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Carnauba wax?
Other glazing agents can serve a similar role, though each has its own look, texture, and melting behavior.
- Plant or mineral waxes: [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}, [talc](/e553b-talc){.additive}
- Animal- or insect-derived coatings: [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive}, [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}
Your choice depends on dietary goals (for example, vegan vs. non-vegan), shine, and processing temperature.

## How is Carnauba wax made?
Carnauba wax is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm. Harvested leaves are dried and gently beaten to release a powdery wax, which is then melted, filtered, and refined. Food-grade material meets strict purity specifications set in EU legislation, and may be sold bleached or unbleached depending on the intended use.[^1]

## Is Carnauba wax safe to eat?
When used as permitted by law, carnauba wax is considered safe by major regulators. In the EU, it is an authorized additive with defined identity and purity requirements and permitted uses in food.[^1][^2] Carnauba wax is poorly digested and largely passes through the body without being absorbed, which limits systemic exposure from normal dietary intake.[^5]

## Does Carnauba wax have any benefits?
Carnauba wax does not add nutrients. Its benefits are practical: it improves surface gloss, helps foods look fresh longer, reduces sticking, and protects delicate coatings during packaging and transport.

## Who should avoid Carnauba wax?
- People who prefer to avoid any surface coatings on foods can look for products labeled “no glazing agents.”
- Vegans should note that carnauba wax is plant-based, but it can sometimes be used alongside animal-derived coatings like [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive} or [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}; check labels.
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to waxes or polishes should consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s car wax, so it can’t be safe to eat.” Fact: The same plant wax is used in many industries, but food-grade carnauba wax meets strict purity and identity standards for use on foods.[^1]
- “It’s a hidden sweetener.” Fact: Carnauba wax is not a sugar or sweetener; it is a non-nutritive surface coating.
- “It builds up in the body.” Fact: Carnauba wax is poorly absorbed and is largely excreted unchanged.[^5]

## Carnauba wax in branded foods
On labels you may see “carnauba wax,” “glazing agent (carnauba wax),” or “E903” (in the EU). Typical products include jelly beans and other polished candies, chocolate dragées, fruit-flavored chewy sweets, chewing gum, coated nuts, and the shiny coats on some vitamin and medicine tablets.
