      "q": "what is iron oxide yellow",
      "a": "Yellow iron oxide (E172III) is a yellow inorganic pigment made of hydrated iron oxide (mainly goethite, FeO(OH)), used as a colorant in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics; it is insoluble and stable to heat and light.",

    {
      "q": "how to lighten yellow iron oxide",
      "a": "Lighten it by reducing its dosage or blending with permitted white/neutral colorants or a light-colored base (e.g., calcium carbonate/E170 where allowed); it cannot be chemically bleached without altering the pigment.",

    {
      "q": "how to make yellow iron oxide",
      "a": "It is produced industrially by oxidizing and precipitating iron salts under controlled pH and temperature to form goethite (FeO(OH)), then washing, filtering, and milling; food‑grade material must meet strict purity limits (e.g., heavy metals).",

    {
      "q": "how to make yellow iron oxide pigment",
      "a": "Manufacturers form goethite by controlled precipitation/oxidation (e.g., from ferrous sulfate solutions), then age, wash, and mill to the desired shade; heating (calcination) can convert yellow to red hematite, so temperature control is critical.",

    {
      "q": "iron oxide minerals which might create red or yellow coloration in sandstones",
      "a": "Red hues are typically from hematite (Fe2O3), while yellow to yellow‑brown tones come from goethite (FeO(OH)) or limonite (hydrated iron oxides); jarosite can also impart yellow coloration in some settings.",
