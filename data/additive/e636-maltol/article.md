Maltol (E636) is a flavor enhancer with a warm, caramel-like aroma that makes sweet foods taste richer. It occurs naturally in browned and roasted foods, and is also made to high purity for use in many processed foods. It is added at very small amounts to round out sweetness and mask off-notes in candies, drinks, and baked goods.

- Typical uses: Candy, chocolate, baked goods, desserts, flavored drinks, and flavor blends
- Dietary: Suitable for vegetarians and vegans; not derived from animal sources
- Labeling: Appears as “maltol,” “E636,” or within “flavor”/“flavoring”
- Allergen status: Not a common allergen
- Use level: Very low (used under good manufacturing practice)

## Why is Maltol added to food?
Food makers add maltol to make sweet flavors taste fuller and more “cooked” or caramel-like. It can smooth harsh or metallic edges from some sweeteners and cocoa, and helps small amounts of flavor carry farther in the finished food. This is useful in confections, baked goods, flavored dairy, and ready-to-drink beverages.

Maltol also pairs well with chocolate, vanilla, fruit, and coffee notes. In sugar‑free items, it can help mask off‑tastes from polyols such as [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) and from some high‑intensity sweeteners.

## What foods contain Maltol?
You’re most likely to find maltol in:
- Candy and chocolate, including caramels and toffees
- Baked goods such as cookies, cakes, and pastries
- Ice cream, puddings, and other desserts
- Flavored drinks and syrups
- Breakfast cereals and snack bars
- Compound flavors used across many categories

On ingredient lists, look for “maltol,” “E636,” or it may be part of a declared “natural flavor” or “artificial flavor,” depending on the recipe and local labeling rules.

## What can replace Maltol?
- [Ethyl maltol](/e637-ethyl-maltol): A close cousin with a stronger, cotton‑candy note; often used when a more intense effect is needed.
- Process choices: Roasting, toasting, and controlled browning can build similar caramelized notes in sauces, syrups, and baked goods.
- Other flavors: Vanilla extracts, cocoa, coffee, maple, and browned sugar profiles can fill a similar role, depending on the product.
- Color‑flavor pairing: Some products use [caramel](/e150-caramel) for color alongside flavor systems to suggest a richer, cooked taste.

## How is Maltol made?
Commercial food‑grade maltol is produced by chemical synthesis and must meet strict identity and purity specifications in the European Union (EU), including an assay of not less than 99% on the dried basis and defined limits for impurities.[^2] It is the compound 3‑hydroxy‑2‑methyl‑4H‑pyran‑4‑one.

Maltol also occurs naturally. It forms during heating and browning (for example, in roasted malt, bread crust, and some cooked fruits), and has been reported in various plants and roasted foods.[^3]

## Is Maltol safe to eat?
In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists maltol among synthetic flavoring substances permitted for direct addition to food, when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, maltol is authorized as E636 on the Union list of food additives and must meet the official specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^4][^2]

These listings mean regulators have reviewed maltol’s intended uses and purity requirements. As with other flavorings, manufacturers use very small amounts to achieve the desired taste.

## Does Maltol have any benefits?
Maltol’s main benefit is sensory: it boosts sweetness perception and adds warm, caramelized notes that make foods taste richer. It does not add meaningful nutrients or calories at the tiny levels typically used.

## Who should avoid Maltol?
- People following an “no added flavors” diet may choose to avoid maltol where it appears on labels.
- If your clinician has advised limiting flavorings or certain processed foods, check ingredient lists for “maltol” or “E636.”
- As with any ingredient, discontinue use and seek advice if you suspect sensitivity.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Maltol is a sweetener.” Fact: Maltol is not a sweetener; it’s a flavoring that enhances the taste of sweetness.
- Myth: “E‑numbers are unsafe.” Fact: An E‑number means the additive is authorized for use in the EU with defined purity criteria and conditions.[^4][^2]
- Myth: “Maltol is always artificial.” Fact: Maltol occurs naturally in browned foods; food‑grade maltol used in manufacturing is typically produced synthetically to consistent purity.[^3][^2]
- Myth: “Maltol adds color.” Fact: Maltol affects flavor; color changes come from other ingredients or processing, such as [caramel](/e150-caramel).

## Maltol in branded foods
Many branded candies, cookies, ice creams, and flavored drinks use maltol to round out caramel, vanilla, chocolate, or fruit profiles. On the label you may see “maltol,” “E636,” or it may be part of a broader “flavor” declaration. Products that need a stronger cotton‑candy note may use [ethyl maltol](/e637-ethyl-maltol) instead, or in combination, to fine‑tune the taste.
