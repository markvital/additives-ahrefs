      "a": "This appears unrelated to food additive E640; in foods, E640 means glycine and its sodium salt (sodium glycinate), used mainly as a flavor enhancer and buffering/chelating agent.",

      "q": "einstein e640 not working when hot",
      "a": "This isn’t about additive E640; glycine and its sodium salt are heat‑stable at normal cooking temperatures and are generally considered safe at typical food-use levels.",

      "q": "how many times has einstein e640 flash fired",
      "a": "There’s no “flash count” for E640—it's the code for glycine/sodium glycinate, a food additive often used at quantum satis (good manufacturing practice) levels where permitted.",

      "q": "how to do flash exposure bracketing with einstein e640",
      "a": "Unrelated to the additive: E640 (glycine/sodium glycinate) enhances savory/sweet notes and can help mask bitterness; it doesn’t involve any photographic exposure settings.",

      "a": "This seems unrelated to E-number E640; note that glycine may be produced synthetically or derived from animal sources (e.g., gelatin), so vegans should check sourcing or labeling.",
