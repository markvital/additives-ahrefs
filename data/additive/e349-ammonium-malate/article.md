Ammonium malate (E349) is the ammonium salt of malic acid, the tart compound found naturally in apples and many fruits. In food and drink, it acts mainly as an acidity regulator and flavor enhancer that adds a clean, sour taste. It is used far less often than other malates and acids, but appears in some specialty formulations.

## At a glance
- What it is: the ammonium salt of malic acid, available as monoammonium or diammonium malate
- What it does: controls acidity (pH) and boosts tart, fruity flavor
- Where it’s found: select beverages, confectionery, and other processed foods; usage is less common than [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) itself
- Labeling: “ammonium malate” or “E349”
- Taste and texture: sharp, persistent tartness similar to malic acid

## Why is ammonium malate added to food?
Food makers add ammonium malate to adjust acidity and to give a persistent, fruity sourness. International standards list it in the functional class of acidity regulators (also called pH control agents) and flavoring agents used under good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^1]

## What foods contain ammonium malate?
Use varies by country and product type. The Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA), developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), includes ammonium malate (INS 349) for certain food categories at GMP levels, which means only as much as needed to achieve the intended effect.[^1] In practice, you’re more likely to see other malates or acids listed on labels, and ammonium malate tends to appear in niche beverages, confectionery, and similar processed foods.

## What can replace ammonium malate?
Depending on the goal (tartness vs. pH control, solubility, cost), common substitutes include:
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) for strong, lingering sourness
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for bright, quick sourness
- [Sodium malates](/e350-sodium-malates), [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate), or [calcium malates](/e352-calcium-malates) when a malate salt is preferred
- [Sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) for buffering capacity and gentle acidity

Regulatory allowances and maximum levels for each option depend on the product and jurisdiction.[^1]

## How is ammonium malate made?
Ammonium malate is produced by neutralizing L-malic acid with ammonia, forming either the monoammonium or diammonium salt depending on the reaction conditions and pH. Food-grade material must meet established purity specifications, including limits on contaminants and identification tests, before it can be used in foods.[^2]

## Is ammonium malate safe to eat?
Ammonium malate has been evaluated internationally along with malic acid and other malate salts. JECFA (the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) has published toxicological evaluations for malic acid and its ammonium, sodium, potassium, and calcium salts in the context of their use as food additives.[^2] Separately, U.S. regulations recognize malic acid itself as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as a flavoring agent and pH control agent when used in line with good manufacturing practice, which helps explain why malate salts are widely used in foods.[^3]

As with any acidity regulator, overall safety depends on use levels, product type, and vulnerable consumer groups. Manufacturers are expected to use the minimum amount needed to achieve the intended technical effect (GMP).[^1]

## Does ammonium malate have any benefits?
- Flavor: delivers a clean, long-lasting sourness often described as “apple-like,” helpful in fruit flavors and sour candies.[^3]
- Formulation: as a salt, it can offer different solubility and handling characteristics compared with the free acid, which can be useful in beverages or powdered mixes.[^1]

## Who should avoid ammonium malate?
Most people can consume foods containing acidity regulators as part of a balanced diet. However:
- Individuals with rare urea cycle disorders (conditions that impair the body’s ability to remove ammonia) should be cautious with sources of ammonium and seek medical advice.[^4]
- People advised by their clinician to limit acidic ingredients or manage reflux may prefer products using milder acidulants.

If you have a specific medical condition, consult a healthcare professional about your diet.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Ammonium means ammonia, so it’s the same as household cleaner.” Fact: Ammonium malate is a solid salt. It is not the same as gaseous ammonia used in cleaning products.
- Myth: “All E-numbers are artificial and unsafe.” Fact: An E-number means the additive has been evaluated for use in the European system. Safety depends on the substance and how it’s used.
- Myth: “Only malic acid gives a tart taste.” Fact: Malates, citrates, and other acidulants can all adjust pH and sourness, each with its own flavor profile and buffering behavior.

## ammonium malate in branded foods
Ammonium malate is less common on labels than other malates or citric acid. When present, it typically appears in ingredient lists as “ammonium malate” or “E349.” If you’re checking a product, scan the ingredient list near other acidulants such as malic or citric acid.
