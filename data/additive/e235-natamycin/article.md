Natamycin (E235) is a natural antifungal preservative used mainly on the surface of cheeses and some cured meats to stop molds and yeasts from growing. It does not target bacteria, so it helps keep food mold-free without disrupting normal bacterial ripening in cheese.

## At a glance
This section gives a quick overview of what natamycin is and how it’s used.
- What it is: A fermentation-made antifungal (also called pimaricin) used as a preservative.
- What it does: Stops molds and yeasts; it’s not effective against bacteria.
- Where it’s used: Mostly on the surface of cheeses; in the EU also on dried, cured sausages.
- How it’s applied: Sprayed, dipped, or dusted as a surface treatment rather than mixed deep into the food.
- Label names: Natamycin, pimaricin, or E235.
- Common alternatives: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive}, [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}, [nisin](/e234-nisin){.additive}, [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive}.

## Why is Natamycin added to food?
Manufacturers use natamycin to prevent spoilage from molds and yeasts, especially on foods with moist surfaces where fungi grow easily. It works by interacting with ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes, which stops fungi from functioning and multiplying. Unlike many preservatives, its activity is antifungal—not antibacterial—so it doesn’t target helpful bacteria used in cheese making.[^4]

## What foods contain Natamycin?
In the United States, natamycin is approved for use as an antimycotic (anti-fungal) on the surface of certain cheeses to help prevent mold growth.[^1] In the European Union, it is authorized for surface treatment of cheeses and dried, cured sausages; it is not intended to be mixed throughout the product or to penetrate deeply.[^2] In stores, you most often find it on rind-treated cheeses and sometimes on sliced or shredded cheese products where surface protection matters.

## What can replace Natamycin?
Depending on the food and the type of spoilage to control, common substitutes include:
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} for broad anti-mold activity
- [Nisin](/e234-nisin){.additive} for controlling certain bacteria in dairy
- [Sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} in acidic foods and beverages
- [Calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} in baked goods

The best choice depends on pH, moisture, and whether the target is mold/yeast or bacteria.

## How is Natamycin made?
Natamycin is produced by fermentation using specific Streptomyces bacteria, then isolated and purified to meet food-grade specifications.[^1][^3] This fermentation process is similar to how some enzymes and vitamins used in food are made, and it yields a consistent ingredient suitable for surface application.

## Is Natamycin safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. and the EU allow natamycin for defined uses and levels in food, which means its safety has been evaluated for those uses.[^1][^2] It is applied to the surface of foods and is active against fungi; it is not used to control bacteria. Its longstanding approvals for surface treatments reflect a focus on limiting exposure to what’s needed to prevent mold while maintaining food quality.[^2]

## Does Natamycin have any benefits?
- Helps keep cheese rinds and similar surfaces free of mold, reducing food waste.
- Because it targets molds and yeasts rather than bacteria, it does not interfere with bacterial cultures used to ripen many cheeses.[^4]
- Used as a surface treatment, so producers can protect where spoilage risk is highest without reformulating the entire product.[^1]

## Who should avoid Natamycin?
Most people can consume foods treated with natamycin within regulatory limits. Individuals who prefer to minimize additives can choose products without it or avoid the rind/surface where it is applied. In the EU, its use is restricted to surface treatment only, which can further limit exposure if the surface is not consumed.[^2] Anyone with a known sensitivity to natamycin from medications should follow advice from their healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Natamycin is an antibiotic for bacteria.”  
  Fact: It’s an antifungal; it targets molds and yeasts, not bacteria.[^4]
- Myth: “It soaks deep into the cheese.”  
  Fact: Regulations allow it as a surface treatment; it is typically applied by spraying or dipping to protect the outer layer.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “It’s synthetic.”  
  Fact: It’s made by fermentation using Streptomyces bacteria and then purified for food use.[^1][^3]

## Natamycin in branded foods
You’ll usually see it on labels as “natamycin,” “pimaricin,” or “E235” (in the EU). It shows up most often on rind-treated cheeses and pre-sliced or shredded cheese packs. If you’re comparing products, check the ingredient list near the end, where preservatives are commonly listed.
