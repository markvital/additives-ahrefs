Acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472) are a family of emulsifiers made by joining food acids to mono- and diglycerides, which themselves come from fats and oils. They help mix oil and water, keep textures smooth, and improve the freshness and volume of baked goods. E472 includes several subtypes, such as acetic, lactic, citric, tartaric, acetyltartaric, mixed acetic/tartaric, and succinic acid esters.

## At a glance
- What it is: A group of emulsifiers formed by attaching common food acids to [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).[^1]
- The subtypes: E472a–g, covering acetic, lactic, citric, tartaric, mono- and diacetyltartaric, mixed acetic/tartaric, and succinic acid esters.[^1]
- What it does: Improves mixing of oil and water, stabilizes foams and emulsions, and enhances dough strength and crumb softness.
- Where it’s used: Bread and rolls, cakes, pastries, margarines and spreads, coffee whiteners, sauces and dressings, ice cream, confectionery, and filled wafers.[^2]
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU with detailed purity specifications and use rules; several members of the group are also permitted in the U.S. for specific applications, including certain meat and poultry products.[^1][^3]

## Why is acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers add E472 to keep ingredients mixed and to create stable, pleasant textures. In bread and other baked goods, E472 can strengthen dough, improve volume, and slow crumb firming. In spreads, ice cream, sauces, and coffee whiteners, it helps blend oil and water and prevents separation.[^2]

## What foods contain acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
You may find one or more E472 types in:
- Yeast-raised bread and buns
- Cakes, donuts, and pastries
- Margarines and low‑fat spreads
- Coffee creamers and whipped toppings
- Dressings, mayonnaise-style products, and sauces
- Confectionery fillings and wafers
- Frozen desserts such as ice cream and frozen yogurt[^2]

On labels, the specific subtype may be named, for example:
- E472a — [acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- E472b — [lactic acid esters](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- E472c — [citric acid esters](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- E472d — [tartaric acid esters](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- E472e — [mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) (often called DATEM)
- E472f — [mixed acetic and tartaric acid esters](/e472f-mixed-acetic-and-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- E472g — [succinylated monoglycerides](/e472g-succinylated-monoglycerides)[^1]

## What can replace acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Possible alternatives depend on the food and the job needed:
- For dough strengthening and emulsification in baked goods: [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- For water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) in chocolate systems
- For thickening and stability in sauces and dairy-style products: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)

## How is acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers start with edible fats and oils to produce mono- and diglycerides, then react them with specific food acids such as [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), or [succinic acid](/e363-succinic-acid). The EU specifications describe the permitted source materials, the reaction products for each subtype (E472a–g), and purity limits for contaminants and residuals.[^1]

## Is acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
In the European Union, the E472 group is authorized as food additives, subject to conditions of use set in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and detailed identity and purity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2][^1] These specifications include limits for heavy metals (such as lead) and define acceptable starting materials and by-products, which are part of how regulators manage safety.[^1] In the United States, certain members of this group (for example, DATEM and lactic acid esters) are allowed in specific meat and poultry applications under USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service policy.[^3]

## Does acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
E472 does not add nutrients, but it can improve how foods feel and hold together. In bread and cakes, it helps with volume and softness; in emulsions like dressings and creamers, it keeps oil and water from separating; in frozen desserts, it supports a smooth texture and slow melt.

## Who should avoid acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
- People who prefer vegetarian or vegan products may wish to check with the brand, because the fatty acids used to make E472 can come from either plant or animal fats, depending on the manufacturer and product.[^1]
- Individuals following special diets for infants and young children should look for products that meet the stricter rules set for those categories, since additive uses can be limited in baby foods under EU law.[^2]
- If you are sensitive to certain ingredients, review labels for the specific subtype name (for example, “DATEM” for E472e) and check with the manufacturer if you need more detail.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E472 is one single chemical.” Fact: It’s a family of several related emulsifiers (E472a–g) made with different food acids.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s a synthetic plastic.” Fact: E472 products are made from edible fats and common food acids; they are authorized food additives with defined purity criteria.[^1]
- Myth: “It isn’t regulated.” Fact: The EU sets conditions of use and strict specifications; some members are also allowed in the U.S. for defined applications.[^2][^3]

## acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists you might see “E472” followed by a letter (a–g), or common names such as “DATEM” (E472e), “LACTEM” (E472b), or “CITREM” (E472c). Many baked goods, spreads, creamers, sauces, and frozen desserts use one of these to improve texture and stability. If you want to know the source (plant vs animal), contact the brand, as this can vary by supplier.
