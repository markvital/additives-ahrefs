Calcium sulphate (E516), also called gypsum, is a food-grade mineral salt used to firm foods, strengthen dough, and help powders stay free‑flowing. You’ll most often see it in tofu, baking mixes, flours, and some canned or processed foods. Regulators in the EU and U.S. allow its use under good manufacturing practice.

## At a glance
- Also known as gypsum or selenite; chemical name calcium sulphate.
- Roles in food: firming agent, stabiliser, dough conditioner, sequestrant, and anti-caking aid.
- Where it shows up: tofu, bakery flours and mixes, tortillas, canned vegetables and fruits, dairy analogues, and some seasonings.
- Forms: anhydrous or dihydrate; food-grade material is highly purified.
- Regulatory status: EU food additive E516; GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) in the U.S. when used as intended.

## Why is Calcium sulphate added to food?
Manufacturers use calcium sulphate to do practical jobs in recipes: firm up plant tissues (for example in canned vegetables), stabilise structure in gels and curds, condition doughs, and keep powders flowing evenly.[^1] In the EU, it is authorised as a food additive (E516) with technological functions including firming agent, sequestrant (binds metal ions), and stabiliser.[^2]

## What foods contain Calcium sulphate?
You can find calcium sulphate in a range of everyday products:
- Soy products such as tofu (listed as “gypsum” or “calcium sulphate”)
- Baking flours and mixes as a flour treatment or dough conditioner
- Tortillas, flatbreads, and some bakery items for texture and handling
- Canned vegetables and fruits as a firming agent
- Dairy alternatives, dessert gels, and confectionery for body and stability

In the U.S., its permitted uses include functions like firming and flour treatment under the GRAS rule for calcium sulphate.[^1] In the EU, E516 is authorised across defined food categories in legislation and has been re-evaluated by EFSA (European Food Safety Authority).[^2]

## What can replace Calcium sulphate?
Depending on the job, technologists may choose:
- Firming in fruits/vegetables or tofu-like products: [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride)
- Anti-caking in powders and spices: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide), [tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate), or [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate)
- Dough conditioning/flour treatment: [calcium carbonate](/e170-calcium-carbonates) or [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), sometimes alongside leavening agents like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)
- Stabilising/thickening in liquids or gels: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum)

## How is Calcium sulphate made?
Food-grade calcium sulphate is produced from purified natural gypsum or by a controlled chemical process, then milled and screened to meet strict purity specifications.[^3] The EU specification allows anhydrous or dihydrate forms for E516 and sets limits for contaminants, identity, and solubility so only highly pure material is used in food.[^3]

## Is Calcium sulphate safe to eat?
Yes—within normal food uses. In the U.S., calcium sulphate is GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) when used in line with good manufacturing practice and its listed functions.[^1] EFSA re‑evaluated sulphates (including E516) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels; an ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) was not considered necessary.[^2]

## Does Calcium sulphate have any benefits?
The benefits are mainly functional:
- Improves texture and firmness in vegetables, curds, and gels
- Helps powders flow and reduces clumping
- Supports dough handling and finished crumb structure

These roles allow consistent quality without adding flavors or colors, and they can work alongside other additives or enzymes to fine‑tune texture.[^1]

## Who should avoid Calcium sulphate?
Most people do not need to avoid E516 in ordinary foods. If your clinician has advised you to limit minerals such as calcium or sulphate (for example, due to a medical condition), read labels and follow that advice. If you manage sensitivities, note that sulphates (like E516) are chemically different from sulphites, which are the preservatives some people react to.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just plaster of Paris in food.” Fact: Food-grade calcium sulphate must meet strict identity and purity specs set in law; it is not the same as construction-grade material.[^3]
- “Sulfates and sulfites are the same.” Myth: Sulphates (like E516) and sulphites (such as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide)) are different chemical groups and used for different purposes.
- “It adds a strong taste.” Myth: Calcium sulphate is essentially tasteless at typical use levels and is chosen for function, not flavor.[^2]

## Calcium sulphate in branded foods
You might spot E516 or “calcium sulphate” on labels of:
- Tofu and soy curd products (often listed as “gypsum”)
- All-purpose and bread flours, tortilla and baking mixes
- Canned tomato products, pickled or canned vegetables
- Plant-based desserts or dairy alternatives needing extra body
- Seasoning blends and drink mixes where free flow matters

Label wording may vary by country and brand.
