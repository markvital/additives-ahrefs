Lecithin citrate (E344) is a modified form of lecithin that helps oil and water mix and stay mixed. It is approved as a food additive in the European Union and appears on labels as “lecithin citrate” or “E344.” It is used in small amounts to fine‑tune texture in foods like spreads, sauces, and confectionery.

## At a glance
- Role: helper emulsifier that stabilizes mixtures of oil and water
- Where used: confectionery, spreads, dressings, instant powders, and other processed foods
- Label names: “lecithin citrate” or “E344” (EU)
- Source: lecithin (often from soy, sunflower, or egg) reacted with citric acid
- Status: regulated in the EU with official purity specifications

## Why is Lecithin citrate added to food?
Food makers use lecithin citrate to make smooth, stable mixtures where oil and water would normally separate. In recipes, it can improve spreadability, help powders disperse, reduce stickiness, and support a consistent bite over shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain Lecithin citrate?
You may find lecithin citrate in:
- Chocolate and confectionery
- Margarine and spreads
- Sauces and dressings
- Instant drink or dessert powders
- Baked goods and fillings

On EU ingredient lists, it may appear as “lecithin citrate” or “E344,” because additives can be declared by name or E‑number.[^3] The EU Food Additives Database lists where a given additive is authorized and its functional class; availability and use can vary by food type and country.[^1]

## What can replace Lecithin citrate?
Depending on the product and process, formulators might use:
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (E322), such as soy or sunflower lecithin
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) (E471)
- [Citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) (E472c)
- Gums and stabilizers (for example, [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) or [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)) alongside an emulsifier
Choice depends on taste, label goals, processing, and cost.

## How is Lecithin citrate made?
Lecithin citrate is produced by treating food‑grade lecithin with citric acid. The EU specification describes the additive’s identity and purity, including how it is obtained from lecithin and the allowable levels of contaminants.[^2] Lecithin itself is typically sourced from soybeans, sunflower seed, or egg yolk, then processed and reacted with citric acid ([citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)) to create the citrate form.

## Is Lecithin citrate safe to eat?
In the European Union, food additives must be authorized by law and meet detailed purity specifications before use. Manufacturers are required to use only the amount needed to achieve the intended effect (a principle often called “quantum satis”).[^3] Lecithin citrate also has an official EU specification that sets identity and purity criteria, which producers must meet.[^2]

## Does Lecithin citrate have any benefits?
This additive does not offer direct health benefits. Its value is technological:
- Helps emulsify and stabilize foods for a smoother texture
- Can aid mixing of powders into liquids
- May improve processing by reducing stickiness or helping flow

## Who should avoid Lecithin citrate?
- People with soy or egg allergies should check labels. Lecithin is often made from soy or egg, and EU rules require allergens like soybeans and eggs to be clearly declared in the ingredient list when present.[^4]
- If you are following a medical diet prescribed by a clinician, ask whether emulsifiers like lecithin citrate fit your plan.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as lecithin.” Not quite. It starts from lecithin but is modified with citric acid to adjust performance in foods.
- “It’s a preservative.” No. Its main role is emulsifying and stabilizing texture, not stopping microbial spoilage.
- “All soy‑based additives trigger soy allergy.” Most people with soy allergy tolerate highly refined soy derivatives, but allergen labeling still applies and individuals should follow medical advice.[^4]
- “It’s used in large amounts.” No. It is typically used at low levels, just enough to do its job.[^3]

## Lecithin citrate in branded foods
You’re most likely to see lecithin citrate in ingredient lists for chocolates, spreads, sauces, or instant mixes. On EU labels it may read “lecithin citrate” or “E344.” Recipes change over time, so always check the current packaging.
