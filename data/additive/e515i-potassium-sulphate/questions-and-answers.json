      "q": "1 gram of aluminum will produce how many grams of potassium aluminum sulphate dodecahydrate",
      "a": "About 17.6 g, assuming the aluminum is fully converted to potassium alum dodecahydrate (KAl(SO4)2·12H2O) using potassium sulphate (E515i) and sulfuric acid at 100% yield.",

      "q": "assumming a 100 yeild 1 gram of aluminum will produce how many grams of potassium aluminum sulphate",
      "a": "About 17.6 g as the common dodecahydrate; if you mean anhydrous KAl(SO4)2, it’s about 9.6 g per 1 g Al (both at 100% yield).",

      "q": "how much \"potassium sulphate\" should i apply to raise *ppm",
      "a": "K2SO4 is 44.9% potassium by weight, so grams needed ≈ 0.00223 × desired K ppm × volume in liters (e.g., raising K by 10 ppm in 100 L needs ~2.23 g K2SO4).",

    {
      "q": "how much potassium is in glucosamine sulphate",
      "a": "In the common glucosamine sulfate 2KCl form, potassium is about 13% by weight (≈195 mg K per 1500 mg); sodium-chloride–stabilized forms contain no potassium.",
