Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (E1442) is a plant-based modified starch used to thicken and stabilize foods. It helps sauces, soups, and desserts keep a smooth texture through heating, freezing, and storage, and it reduces separation of liquids. It is approved in many countries and considered safe at permitted levels.

## At a glance
- Names: Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate, E1442
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, emulsifier
- Where it’s found: Soups, sauces, dressings, dairy desserts, pie fillings, ready meals
- What it’s made from: Common starch sources such as corn, potato, or tapioca, then carefully modified
- Labeling you might see: “E1442,” “hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate,” or sometimes “modified starch”
- Dietary notes: Plant-derived; does not add flavor, only texture and stability

## Why is Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate added to food?
Food makers use E1442 to build body and creaminess, and to keep products stable when exposed to heat, shear (mixing), acidity, or freezing and thawing. This modified starch resists breaking down under tough processing conditions, so sauces don’t thin out and frozen foods don’t weep water after thawing.[^1]

## What foods contain Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate?
You’ll most often see E1442 in:
- Canned and chilled soups, instant sauces, and gravies
- Salad dressings and dips
- Fruit preparations and pie fillings
- Dairy desserts and flavored milks
- Frozen ready meals and reheatable entrees

These are typical uses reported to European regulators for modified starches, a group that includes E1442.[^1]

## What can replace Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- Other modified starches with similar stability:
  - [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate){.additive}
  - [acetylated distarch phosphate](/e1414-acetylated-distarch-phosphate){.additive}
  - [acetylated distarch adipate](/e1422-acetylated-distarch-adipate){.additive}
  - [hydroxypropyl starch](/e1440-hydroxypropyl-starch){.additive}
- Hydrocolloid gums for strong thickening at low doses:
  - [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}
  - [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}
  - [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}
  - [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- Native starches (corn, tapioca, potato) if the product isn’t exposed to intense heat, acid, or freeze–thaw

## How is Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate made?
It starts with edible starch (such as corn or potato). The starch is:
1) lightly cross‑linked with phosphate reagents to form “distarch phosphate,” and
2) etherified with propylene oxide to add hydroxypropyl groups.
In the United States, these modifications and their maximum reagent levels are set in regulation for “food starch‑modified” (for example, propylene oxide up to specified limits; phosphorus oxychloride and sodium trimetaphosphate/tripolyphosphate within strict caps).[^2]

## Is Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate safe to eat?
International expert committees have evaluated modified starches (the group that includes E1442) and concluded they are of low toxicity and acceptable for use in food; an “ADI not specified” was assigned, reflecting a low risk at typical use levels.[^3] In the U.S., modified food starches are authorized for use under detailed conditions in federal regulation.[^2]

## Does Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate have any benefits?
- Helps sauces and fillings stay thick and glossy after heating or long storage
- Improves freeze–thaw stability, reducing ice crystal damage and water separation in frozen foods
- Stabilizes texture in acidic products like dressings and fruit fillings
- Provides a neutral taste so it doesn’t mask flavors

## Who should avoid Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate?
- People with allergies to the source starch (for example, wheat) should check labels. In the U.S., “wheat” must be declared if present, even when used to make modified starch.[^4]
- Individuals on carbohydrate‑restricted diets may wish to limit foods thickened with starch, depending on personal goals.
- If your clinician has advised you to avoid specific starch sources, read ingredient lists or contact the manufacturer for sourcing details.

## Myths & facts
- “Modified starch means genetically modified.” Fact: Chemical “modification” refers to how the starch molecules are treated for function. It does not automatically mean the crop was genetically engineered.
- “E1442 is just another name for MSG.” Myth: E1442 is a starch‑based thickener, not a flavor enhancer like [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}.
- “It adds lots of phosphorus to food.” Myth: The phosphate cross‑linking uses very small amounts of reagents under strict limits set in regulation.[^2]

## Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists you may see “hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate,” “modified starch,” or “E1442” (common in the EU). It appears in many mainstream products such as jarred sauces, canned soups, fruit fillings, spoonable dressings, dairy desserts, and frozen meals. Availability and naming can vary by country and brand.
