Trisodium diphosphate (E450ii) is a phosphate salt that helps foods keep moisture, hold a steady texture, and mix evenly. It works as an emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, humectant, and metal-binding agent. You’ll most often see it in baked goods, processed meats and seafood, dairy-based items, and powdered mixes.

## At a glance
- What it is: A diphosphate (also called a pyrophosphate) salt of sodium used as a multi‑purpose food additive.
- What it does: Acts as an emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, humectant, pH buffer, and sequestrant (binds metals).
- Where it’s used: Baked goods, processed meats and seafood, processed cheese, dairy desserts, and instant drink mixes.
- Source: Made from mineral [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} and sodium salts; not animal‑derived.
- Dietary notes: Suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets. Adds both phosphorus and sodium to the diet.
- Regulatory snapshot: Authorized in the EU and many other regions within set limits; evaluated as part of the phosphate additive group.

## Why is Trisodium diphosphate added to food?
Food makers use it because one ingredient can do several jobs at once. As a sequestrant, it binds trace metals (like iron), which helps prevent discoloration and off‑flavors. As an emulsifier and stabiliser, it helps fat and water stay mixed and keeps textures even in items like processed cheese and dairy desserts. In bakery mixes, it can support controlled leavening when used alongside baking soda. In meats and some seafood products, it helps retain moisture and improve tenderness.[^3]

## What foods contain Trisodium diphosphate?
You may find E450ii in:
- Bakery mixes, cakes, pancakes, and waffles
- Processed cheese and cheese spreads
- Deli meats, hams, and formed meat products
- Surimi (imitation crab), shrimp, and other processed seafood
- Instant puddings, cocoa mixes, and flavored drink powders

These uses are typical for diphosphates in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA), which lists phosphates across multiple food categories.[^3]

## What can replace Trisodium diphosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- For leavening in baking: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive} paired with an acid such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone){.additive}.
- For emulsifying/stabilising: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive} or gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}.
- For metal chelation: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}, or calcium disodium EDTA [EDTA stands for ethylenediaminetetraacetate] ([calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate){.additive}) in applications where permitted.
- For water‑binding/texture in meats and seafood: other phosphate blends like [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates){.additive} or [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates){.additive}, or non‑phosphate options such as certain hydrocolloids.

## How is Trisodium diphosphate made?
Food‑grade trisodium diphosphate is produced from purified [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} neutralized with sodium salts (such as [sodium carbonates](/e500-sodium-carbonates){.additive}), followed by controlled heating (dehydration) to form the diphosphate structure. The process is adjusted to reach the trisodium form and to meet strict purity specifications set in EU law, including limits on contaminants.[^2]

## Is Trisodium diphosphate safe to eat?
In 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated phosphates (including diphosphates E450) as a group and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for total phosphate exposure from all food additive sources. EFSA also noted that some high‑consuming groups could exceed this level and advised reviewing maximum permitted levels in certain foods.[^1] Within regulatory limits, EFSA did not flag genotoxicity or carcinogenicity concerns for the phosphate group.[^1]

## Does Trisodium diphosphate have any benefits?
For consumers, it mainly improves quality and consistency. It can help baked goods rise more evenly, keep processed cheese smooth, reduce chalky or metallic tastes by binding trace metals, and keep meats and seafood juicier after cooking. These are recognized functions for diphosphates in international food standards.[^3]

## Who should avoid Trisodium diphosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease or those told to limit phosphorus should be cautious with phosphate additives, which are highly absorbable and can raise dietary phosphorus load.[^4]
- Anyone on a strict sodium‑restricted diet may also wish to limit foods with sodium phosphate additives.
- Infants, toddlers, and people with specific metabolic conditions should follow advice from their healthcare provider on phosphate intake.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as household cleaners.” Fact: While related chemically, food‑grade trisodium diphosphate must meet strict purity and identity standards set in EU specifications for additives.[^2]
- Myth: “Phosphate additives are always harmful.” Fact: EFSA concluded phosphate additives are safe within the group ADI, though total intake should be managed in high‑consuming groups.[^1]
- Myth: “All phosphorus is absorbed the same.” Fact: Phosphate additives are typically absorbed more readily than phosphorus bound in whole foods, which matters for people who need to limit phosphorus.[^4]

## Trisodium diphosphate in branded foods
Manufacturers list it on labels as “E450ii,” “E450,” or “trisodium diphosphate.” You’ll commonly see it on ingredient lists for deli meats, processed cheese slices, surimi sticks, frozen breaded seafood, boxed baking mixes, and powdered drink or pudding mixes. Product use varies by brand and country, so always check the label.
