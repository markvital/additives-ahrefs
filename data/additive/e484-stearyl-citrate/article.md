Stearyl citrate (E484) is a fat-soluble ester of citric acid used in small amounts to help keep oils and fats stable. It works mainly as an antioxidant, emulsifier, and metal-binding agent in fatty foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: An ester made from citric acid and stearyl alcohol (a long-chain fatty alcohol), designed to work in oily or fatty foods.
- What it does: Helps slow rancidity (antioxidant), binds trace metals that speed up oxidation (sequestrant), and can support emulsion stability (emulsifier).
- Where it’s found: Most often in fats and oils, shortenings, margarines, and fat-rich bakery or snack products.
- Regulatory note: In the European Union (EU), E484 has purity specifications and may be used only under the conditions set by EU food additive law.
- Labeling: In the EU, additives are labeled by functional class plus name or E‑number (for example, “antioxidant: stearyl citrate (E484)”).

## Why is Stearyl citrate added to food?
Food makers use stearyl citrate to protect oils and fats from going rancid and to make emulsions more stable. In practical terms, it slows down oxidation in fat-rich products and binds pro‑oxidant metals such as iron and copper that can speed up off‑flavors. In the EU, E484 is defined with specific purity criteria as an antioxidant/sequestrant/emulsifier for use in foods under the food additive rules.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Stearyl citrate?
You are most likely to find E484 in:
- Edible oils and fats (for example, frying oils, shortenings, and margarines)
- Fat-rich bakery products and snack coatings
- Other emulsified or oil-based foods where oxidative stability matters

Exact permissions and maximum levels depend on the product category and national or regional rules; in the EU these are set under the food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Stearyl citrate?
Depending on the recipe and regulatory setting, formulators may use:
- Other antioxidants: mixed tocopherols ([tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)), [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Oil-compatible chelators and synergists: [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate)
- Emulsifiers that also aid stability: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)

The best substitute depends on the food, desired shelf life, and labeling goals.

## How is Stearyl citrate made?
Stearyl citrate is produced by esterifying citric acid with stearyl alcohol (octadecanol). The process yields a mixture of mono‑, di‑, and tri‑stearyl citrate esters, which is then refined to meet purity specifications for food use.[^1] This makes the citric acid portion fat‑soluble so it can work inside oils and fats rather than only in water.

## Is Stearyl citrate safe to eat?
Within the EU, stearyl citrate is an approved food additive with established identity and purity criteria, and it may be used only according to the conditions laid down in the food additives framework.[^1][^2] When used as intended and listed on the label, it is considered acceptable for the general population under those rules. In the EU, labels must show additives by functional class together with their specific name or E‑number (for example, “antioxidant: stearyl citrate (E484)”).[^3]

## Does Stearyl citrate have any benefits?
- Helps extend the shelf life of oils and fat-rich foods by slowing rancidity.
- Binds trace metals that catalyze oxidation, improving flavor stability over time.
- Can support emulsion stability in products that combine oil and water.

These are technological (processing) benefits rather than nutritional ones.

## Who should avoid Stearyl citrate?
- There are no specific avoidance recommendations for the general population under EU rules. People following physician‑directed diets for fat intolerance or specific additive sensitivities should check labels and seek personal advice.
- As with any additive, if you have been advised to limit certain ingredients, discuss product choices with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E‑numbers are always artificial.” Fact: An E‑number simply means the additive is approved in the EU; some E‑numbers are nature‑identical or derived from natural sources.
- Myth: “Antioxidants always add flavor.” Fact: Antioxidants like stearyl citrate are used at very low levels to protect flavor, not to add it.
- Myth: “All citric‑acid‑based additives are the same.” Fact: The fatty part (here, stearyl) changes where and how the molecule works in food.

## Stearyl citrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “stearyl citrate” or “E484,” often paired with a functional class like “antioxidant.”[^3] You’re most likely to see it in fats and oils, margarines, shortenings, baked goods with high fat content, and certain snacks where oil stability matters. Availability varies by country and by brand policy.
