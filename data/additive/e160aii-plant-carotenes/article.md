Plant carotenes (E160a(ii)) are natural yellow‑to‑orange colorings extracted from plants such as carrots and certain vegetable oils. They are used to give foods a warm, appetizing hue and are permitted by major regulators when made to strict purity standards.

## At a glance
- Plant carotenes are a blend of carotenoid pigments from plant sources, mainly beta‑carotene.
- They color foods from pale yellow to deep orange without adding strong flavor.
- Common in drinks, dairy analogues, bakery, confectionery, and fats and oils.
- Approved in the European Union as E160a(ii) with detailed purity rules; beta‑carotene color is also permitted in the United States under federal regulations.[^2][^3]

## Why is Plant carotenes added to food?
Food makers use plant carotenes to restore or enhance a naturally expected golden or orange color, or to create a consistent look across batches. In the EU, they are authorized as color additives under the general food additives regulation and listed specifications.[^2] In the U.S., beta‑carotene used for coloring is an approved color additive “exempt from certification,” meaning it does not require batch-by-batch dye certification but must meet federal identity and purity criteria.[^3]

## What foods contain Plant carotenes?
You’ll find plant carotenes in products where a yellow to orange shade fits: soft drinks and juices, flavored milk and dairy alternatives, margarines and spreads, cheeses, baked goods, breakfast cereals, ice creams, sauces, and confectionery. In the EU, permitted use and any maximum levels depend on the food category defined in the food additives regulation.[^2]

## What can replace Plant carotenes?
Depending on the target shade and recipe, common alternatives include:
- [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive} for bright yellow
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive} for yellow to orange
- [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive} or [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene){.additive} for orange to red
- Other carotenoids such as [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene){.additive}, [lutein](/e161b-lutein){.additive}, or [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin){.additive}
Choice depends on heat/light stability, solubility (oil- vs water‑dispersible), and labeling preferences.

## How is Plant carotenes made?
Plant carotenes are obtained by extracting carotenoid pigments from plant materials (for example, carrots or certain vegetable oils) using permitted food‑grade solvents, then concentrating and standardizing the color.[^1] The final preparation may be dispersed in vegetable oil or formulated into emulsions for water-based foods, and it can include antioxidants such as tocopherols (vitamin E) to protect the color during storage.[^1] Related carotenoid colors as a group are often referred to as [carotenoids](/e160-carotenoids){.additive}.

## Is Plant carotenes safe to eat?
When produced to the official specification and used as intended, plant carotenes are considered safe by major regulators. In the EU, detailed purity criteria (including allowed sources and residual solvent limits) apply to E160a(ii).[^1] In the U.S., beta‑carotene as a color additive is permitted under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and must meet identity and safety requirements for its intended uses.[^3]

## Does Plant carotenes have any benefits?
Beyond color, the major pigment beta‑carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid, meaning the body can convert it to vitamin A. However, the small amounts used for coloring make only a modest contribution to intake.[^4]

## Who should avoid Plant carotenes?
Most people do not need to avoid plant carotenes in foods. Guidance to limit high‑dose beta‑carotene supplements applies mainly to people who smoke or were exposed to asbestos, because large supplemental doses were linked with higher lung cancer risk in those groups; this does not refer to the tiny amounts used as food color.[^4] If you have a medical reason to track carotenoid intake, follow your healthcare provider’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s synthetic.” Plant carotenes (E160a(ii)) are sourced from plants; a separate entry covers synthetic or single‑compound [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene){.additive}.
- “It changes the taste.” At typical use levels, it provides color with little to no flavor impact.
- “Natural colors are unstable.” Carotenes can be sensitive to light and oxygen, but modern formulations (for example, oil dispersions and antioxidants like [tocopherols](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive}) improve stability.

## Plant carotenes in branded foods
On EU ingredient lists, look for “plant carotenes,” “mixed carotenes,” or “E160a(ii).” In the U.S., the label usually lists “beta‑carotene (color)” or simply “beta‑carotene.” Packages of drinks, dairy analogues, spreads, cereals, and snacks often use these terms when an orange or yellow hue is desired.
