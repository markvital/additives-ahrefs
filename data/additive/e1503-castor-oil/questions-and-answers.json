      "a": "In foods, castor oil (E1503) serves as a carrier/carrier solvent and emulsifier to help dissolve and evenly distribute colors and flavors. Outside food use, refined castor oil is also used in cosmetics as an emollient, but that’s separate from its role as a food additive.",

      "q": "is castor oil good for skin",
      "a": "Cosmetic-grade castor oil can act as an occlusive moisturizer and skin softener, but evidence for special skin benefits is limited and some people may experience irritation or breakouts. Use cosmetic-grade only, patch test first, and note that food-additive E1503 isn’t intended for topical use.",

      "q": "how to use castor oil on face",
      "a": "If using it cosmetically, apply a small amount of cosmetic-grade castor oil diluted with a lighter oil to damp skin and patch test first, avoiding the eye area. Stop use if irritation or breakouts occur; this is separate from its intended food-additive use.",
