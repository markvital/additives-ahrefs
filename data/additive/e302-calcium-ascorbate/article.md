Calcium ascorbate (E302) is the calcium salt of vitamin C. It works as an antioxidant that helps keep foods’ color and flavor, and it can also add vitamin C to fortified foods and supplements.

## At a glance
- E-number: E302; function: antioxidant and vitamin C source
- Typical uses: helps slow oxidation in beverages, fruit products, and other processed foods
- Appearance and taste: white, nearly neutral-tasting powder that dissolves in water
- Related additives: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) (E300) and [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) (E301)

## Why is Calcium ascorbate added to food?
Food makers use calcium ascorbate to slow oxidation, which helps prevent flavor changes and discoloration during shelf life.[^1] It is part of the “ascorbates” group (vitamin C and its salts) that act as antioxidants in many recipes.[^1]

## What foods contain Calcium ascorbate?
You may find calcium ascorbate in vitamin C–fortified drinks, canned or packaged fruit, fruit spreads, snack products, and various processed foods where color or flavor needs protection. In the European Union, it is an authorized additive in many food categories under the general food additives regulation.[^4] In the United States, it appears in FDA’s public inventory of substances added to food.[^3]

## What can replace Calcium ascorbate?
- Other ascorbates: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) (E300) and [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) offer similar antioxidant effects.
- Other antioxidants for certain applications: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) (a helper/acidulant that can limit oxidation), [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) or [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), and [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary).  
The best substitute depends on the food, flavor, solubility, and labeling goals.

## How is Calcium ascorbate made?
Calcium ascorbate is produced by neutralizing L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with a calcium base, typically calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide, then drying and milling to the desired particle size.[^2] Its composition and purity are set by the EU specifications for food additives.[^2]

## Is Calcium ascorbate safe to eat?
EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) re-evaluated ascorbic acid and its salts (E300–E302) and concluded there is no safety concern at reported use levels as food additives.[^1] In the U.S., calcium ascorbate is listed in FDA’s Substances Added to Food database, which catalogs ingredients used in foods along with their regulatory status.[^3] As a source of vitamin C, usual dietary intakes from foods are well below the tolerable upper intake level for adults (2,000 mg/day of vitamin C from all sources).[^5]

## Does Calcium ascorbate have any benefits?
- Technological: it helps protect color and flavor by slowing oxidation in foods.[^1]
- Nutritional: it provides vitamin C, and the different forms of vitamin C (including calcium ascorbate) are similarly bioavailable in the body when taken at typical amounts.[^5]

## Who should avoid Calcium ascorbate?
Most people do not need to avoid calcium ascorbate in normal food amounts. However:
- People prone to kidney stones should be mindful of high vitamin C intakes because excess vitamin C can increase oxalate in the urine.[^5]
- Individuals with hemochromatosis (iron overload) are often advised to avoid very high vitamin C intakes, which can increase iron absorption.[^5]  
If you have a medical condition or take medications, ask a healthcare professional about your total vitamin C intake.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Calcium ascorbate is just calcium.” Fact: It is the calcium salt of vitamin C, so it provides vitamin C and a small amount of calcium.
- Myth: “It’s the same as a preservative that kills germs.” Fact: Calcium ascorbate is an antioxidant; it slows oxidation but is not an antimicrobial preservative.
- Myth: “Only pure ascorbic acid works.” Fact: Calcium ascorbate and other ascorbates perform similar antioxidant roles in many foods.

## Calcium ascorbate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll typically see “calcium ascorbate” or “calcium ascorbate (antioxidant).” In fortified products and supplements, it may appear as “vitamin C (as calcium ascorbate).” It is common in shelf-stable fruit products, beverages, snacks, and multivitamin formulas that aim to maintain color and deliver vitamin C.
