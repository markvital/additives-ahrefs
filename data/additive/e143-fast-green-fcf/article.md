Fast Green FCF (E143), also known as FD&C Green No. 3, is a synthetic green dye used to color foods, beverages, and some medicines. It is regulated as a certified color additive in the United States, and Codex Alimentarius lists conditions for its use internationally; actual permissions vary by country.

## Why is Fast Green FCF added to food?
Manufacturers use Fast Green FCF to make products look consistently green or to replace color lost during processing. Color can signal flavor (for example, mint) and help consumers tell products apart on the shelf. In the U.S., it is a color additive “subject to certification,” meaning every batch must meet identity and purity requirements before use in foods.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Fast Green FCF?
Allowed uses depend on the country. Codex Alimentarius (the international food standards program of FAO/WHO) lists Fast Green FCF (INS 143) for certain food categories such as sugar confectionery, decorations and coatings, beverages, chewing gum, and similar products, with maximum use levels set by category.[^3] In the U.S., FDA’s color additive program permits FD&C Green No. 3 in foods under specified conditions and after batch certification.[^1]

Common product types where a green dye may be used include:
- Candies and candy coatings
- Icing, glazes, and dessert decorations
- Chewing gum
- Flavored drinks and syrups

Always check the ingredient list for “Fast Green FCF,” “FD&C Green No. 3,” or “E143.”[^1]

## What can replace Fast Green FCF?
Depending on the shade, processing needs, and local rules, manufacturers may use:
- Natural greens such as [chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) or their [copper complexes](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins)
- Another green colorant such as [Green S](/e142-green-s) where permitted
- Blends of other colors to make green, for example [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) plus [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf), or [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) plus [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf)

Choice of alternative depends on desired hue, stability, labeling goals (natural vs synthetic), and regional regulations.[^3]

## How is Fast Green FCF made?
Fast Green FCF is produced synthetically through multi-step organic chemistry, then standardized and purified. In the United States, it is one of the FDA “certified” color additives—each manufacturer’s batch must be submitted and certified to meet strict identity and purity specifications before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics.[^2][^4]

## Is Fast Green FCF safe to eat?
Regulators evaluate color additives for safety and set conditions of use. In the U.S., FDA permits FD&C Green No. 3 in foods within specified uses and requires batch certification to control impurities.[^1][^2] Internationally, Codex lists Fast Green FCF with category-specific maximum levels to manage intake across different foods.[^3] When used within these rules, it is considered safe by the relevant authorities that authorize it.[^1][^3]

## Does Fast Green FCF have any benefits?
Its benefit is cosmetic: it makes foods look green and consistent from batch to batch. It does not add flavor or nutrition. Visual appeal can help consumers recognize flavors and brands, and can make products more attractive.

## Who should avoid Fast Green FCF?
- People advised by a healthcare professional to avoid artificial colors should skip products listing Fast Green FCF (FD&C Green No. 3, E143).[^1]
- Anyone who notices sensitivity to brightly colored processed foods may choose products colored with permitted “natural” alternatives such as [chlorophylls](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins), where available.[^3]

If you have specific medical or dietary concerns, consult your clinician.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All green food colors are natural.” Fact: Fast Green FCF is a synthetic color that is certified for identity and purity before use in the U.S.[^2]
- Myth: “Fast Green FCF isn’t regulated.” Fact: FDA permits its use only after batch-by-batch certification and within defined conditions; many countries also regulate it through their own systems or Codex-based standards.[^1][^3]
- Myth: “It’s the same everywhere.” Fact: Permissions and maximum levels vary by region; always check local regulations and product labels.[^3]

## Fast Green FCF in branded foods
You are most likely to find Fast Green FCF in ingredient lists on:
- Candies and coatings
- Beverage mixes and syrups
- Chewing gum
- Cake decorations and icings

On U.S. labels it may appear as “FD&C Green No. 3” or “Fast Green FCF”; on international labels you may see “E143.”[^1][^3]
