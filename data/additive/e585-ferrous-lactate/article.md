Ferrous lactate (E585) is a food additive made from iron and lactic acid. It is used mostly to help keep the dark color of processed black olives stable and even. In the amounts used in foods, it contributes very little iron to the diet.

## At a glance
- What it is: A salt of iron (iron(II)) and lactic acid.
- What it does: Keeps the dark color of processed black (ripe) olives stable.
- Where you’ll see it: Ingredient lists on canned or bottled olives, shown as “ferrous lactate” or “E585.”
- Taste/texture impact: Used at very low levels; it does not change flavor noticeably.
- Dietary notes: Provides only trace iron at typical use levels.

## Why is Ferrous lactate added to food?
Ferrous lactate acts as a color stabilizer. In processed black (ripe) olives, it helps “fix” the dark color so it looks even and does not fade during shelf life.[^1]

In the European Union (EU), it is an authorized food additive for this color-retention role under the food additives framework.[^2]

## What foods contain Ferrous lactate?
You are most likely to find it in:
- Canned or bottled ripe (black) table olives
- Sliced or whole black olives used as pizza or salad toppings

Labeling may show “ferrous lactate,” “iron(II) lactate,” or “E585.”[^2]

## What can replace Ferrous lactate?
Manufacturers sometimes choose other options depending on the product and local rules:
- [Ferrous gluconate](/e579-iron-gluconate){.additive}, another iron salt widely used for stabilizing the color of ripe olives
- Process adjustments (e.g., time and oxygen exposure) to control olive darkening during curing
- Antioxidants such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} used for general color and flavor protection in foods (not a direct substitute in every olive process)

## How is Ferrous lactate made?
Ferrous lactate is the iron(II) salt of lactic acid. It is produced by reacting lactic acid with a suitable iron source to form a stable salt that meets purity and identity specifications set in EU law.[^3] Lactic acid itself is commonly made by fermenting sugars with safe food-grade microbes.

## Is Ferrous lactate safe to eat?
Based on evaluations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), ferrous lactate used at the reported levels in foods is not a safety concern. Exposure from its limited uses is low.[^1] 

As with any iron compound, very high intakes of iron can cause stomach upset, constipation, or more serious effects. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) lists a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for iron of 45 mg/day for adults from all sources (food, water, and supplements). Typical amounts of ferrous lactate in olives are far below this level.[^4]

## Does Ferrous lactate have any benefits?
- For food quality: It keeps the dark color of ripe olives uniform and stable through storage and heating.[^1]
- For nutrition: It may add a trace amount of iron, but it is not usually used at levels intended to fortify foods with iron.

## Who should avoid Ferrous lactate?
Most people do not need to avoid it. However:
- People with iron overload conditions (such as hemochromatosis) should watch total iron intake from all sources.[^4]
- Children should not access iron-containing supplements without supervision; while the small amounts in foods are low, iron overdose from supplements can be dangerous.[^4]

If you have a medical condition related to iron, ask your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All black olives are naturally jet black.”  
  Fact: Many “ripe” black olives are made from green olives that are darkened by oxidation during processing; iron salts like ferrous lactate help stabilize that color so it stays uniform in the jar or can.[^2]
- Myth: “Lactic acid means it comes from milk.”  
  Fact: Lactic acid is a common food acid typically produced by fermenting sugars; it is not the same as lactose (milk sugar).

## Ferrous lactate in branded foods
You’ll mostly see E585 on ingredient lists for canned or bottled black (ripe) olives. Labels may read “ripe olives, water, salt, ferrous lactate” or include “E585” in parentheses after the name. Availability and labeling can vary by country and brand.
