Tricalcium phosphate (E341iii) is a calcium salt that helps powders stay free‑flowing and adds calcium to foods. It is common in table salt, spice mixes, and fortified drinks and cereals. Most people can eat it safely at the levels used in foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: A food‑grade form of calcium phosphate used in many dry foods.
- What it does: Prevents clumping (anti‑caking) and can fortify foods with calcium.
- Where it shows up: Table salt, spice blends, powdered mixes, and some fortified beverages and cereals.
- Safety: Approved in both the United States and European Union with limits that protect consumers.
- Label names: “Tricalcium phosphate,” “calcium phosphate, tribasic,” or “E341(iii).”

## Why is Tricalcium phosphate added to food?
Food makers add tricalcium phosphate to keep powders from clumping and to help them pour easily. It also serves as a calcium source to fortify foods and drinks. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms it as “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) for these uses under good manufacturing practice. [^1]

## What foods contain Tricalcium phosphate?
You are most likely to find tricalcium phosphate in:
- Table salt and seasoning blends, where it acts as an anti‑caking agent
- Powdered mixes (for example, baking, drink, or dessert mixes)
- Fortified foods and beverages, such as certain cereals or plant‑based drinks, where it supplies calcium

In the European Union, it is part of the phosphate group of additives and may be used in many categories with set limits. [^2]

## What can replace Tricalcium phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it does:
- Anti‑caking in dry blends: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide){.additive}, [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate){.additive}, or [magnesium carbonate](/e504i-magnesium-carbonate){.additive}
- Calcium fortification: [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate){.additive} or [calcium citrate](/e333-calcium-citrates){.additive}

Choice of substitute can change texture, taste, and calcium absorption, so formulators test to find the best fit.

## How is Tricalcium phosphate made?
Food‑grade tricalcium phosphate is typically produced by reacting purified [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} with a calcium source (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) to form a solid that is then filtered, dried, and milled. EU specifications set identity and purity criteria, including limits for impurities like fluoride and heavy metals. [^3]

## Is Tricalcium phosphate safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the U.S., the FDA lists tricalcium phosphate as GRAS as an anti‑caking agent and nutrient supplement used at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice. [^1] In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated phosphates as a group and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus (the element). ADI means the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. [^2]

## Does Tricalcium phosphate have any benefits?
- It helps powders stay dry and free‑flowing, improving handling and shelf life.
- As a fortificant, it provides calcium, a mineral needed for healthy bones, teeth, muscles, and nerves. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) notes that adequate calcium intake is essential across life stages. [^4]

## Who should avoid Tricalcium phosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those advised to limit phosphorus should review phosphate additives with their healthcare provider, because the kidneys help control phosphorus balance. [^5]
- Anyone on a medically restricted calcium or phosphorus diet should check labels and seek personal advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as bone or rock dust.” Fact: Food‑grade tricalcium phosphate must meet strict identity and purity standards for additives. [^3]
- Myth: “It always causes calcium overload.” Fact: It is used at low levels in most foods; total calcium intake from all sources matters most. [^4]
- Myth: “Phosphates in food are unregulated.” Fact: Both the FDA and EFSA regulate phosphate additives and set safe use conditions. [^1][^2]
- Myth: “All calcium phosphates are interchangeable.” Fact: E341 covers three forms—[monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate){.additive}, [dicalcium phosphate](/e341ii-dicalcium-phosphate){.additive}, and tricalcium phosphate—and they behave differently in food.

## Tricalcium phosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “tricalcium phosphate,” “calcium phosphate (tribasic),” or “E341(iii).” You’ll often see it in:
- Free‑flowing table salt and spice blends
- Powdered mixes (for example, baking or drink mixes)
- Calcium‑fortified products like some cereals and plant‑based beverages
