Cassia gum (E427) is a plant-based thickener made from the ground endosperm of Cassia (Senna) seeds. It helps foods stay smooth, stable, and consistent, even through heating and cooling. In the European Union (EU), it is an authorised additive with strict purity rules.

## At a glance
- Cassia gum (E427) comes from the endosperm of seeds of the Cassia (Senna) tora and Senna obtusifolia plants.
- It acts as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier in foods.
- On labels you may see “cassia gum” or “E427.”
- It is plant-derived and usually used at very small amounts in recipes.
- In the EU, its identity and purity are set by law, and its use is only allowed in specific food categories.

## Why is Cassia gum added to food?
Cassia gum makes watery mixtures thicker and helps keep ingredients from separating. This improves texture, gives a creamy or gel-like feel, and helps products stay stable during transport, storage, heating, and cooling. It is often chosen when a firm, elastic texture or long-term stability is needed.

## What foods contain Cassia gum?
Rules differ by country, but in the EU cassia gum (E427) is authorised for use only in certain foods listed in the food additives regulation. If used, it must follow the permitted food categories and conditions set in that law.[^2] Outside the EU, allowed uses can vary, so manufacturers follow their local regulations.

## What can replace Cassia gum?
- Other galactomannan gums: [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) and [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum)
- Microbial or seaweed gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), and [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- Fruit-based gelling agents: [pectins](/e440-pectins)

The best substitute depends on the food, the desired thickness, and whether a gel, a pourable sauce, or a creamy mouthfeel is needed.

## How is Cassia gum made?
Cassia gum is defined as the milled endosperm of seeds from Senna (Cassia) tora and Senna obtusifolia. To make it, the seeds are cleaned, the hull and germ are removed, and the endosperm is ground to a fine powder. Some processes use water and food-grade alcohols to help separate and purify the gum before drying and milling. Its main component is a galactomannan polysaccharide, and official specifications limit moisture and certain impurities to protect quality.[^1]

## Is Cassia gum safe to eat?
In the EU, cassia gum is an authorised food additive. That means it has been assessed and may be used only in the foods and amounts set by the law. Its identity and purity criteria are laid out in the EU specifications, and food makers must meet those limits when using E427.[^2][^1]

## Does Cassia gum have any benefits?
- Texture: It thickens liquids and can build body or gel-like textures at low doses.
- Stability: It helps keep emulsions and suspensions from separating, which can reduce syneresis (water weeping) in gels.
- Processing: It can help products handle heat, chilling, and transport without losing quality.
- Blends: It is often combined with other gums to fine-tune texture and mouthfeel.

## Who should avoid Cassia gum?
Most people do not need to avoid cassia gum when it is used as intended. If you have been told to limit certain fibers or hydrocolloids, or you have a history of sensitivities to gums, speak with a healthcare professional. As with many additives, infant foods follow their own stricter rules; always check labels and follow your child’s healthcare advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Cassia gum is the same as the cassia spice (cinnamon).” Fact: The spice comes from bark; cassia gum comes from the seeds of Cassia (Senna) plants and is used for texture, not flavor.
- Myth: “Gums are always synthetic.” Fact: Cassia gum is plant-derived.
- Myth: “It’s added in large amounts.” Fact: Food technologists typically use very small amounts to get the desired texture.

## Cassia gum in branded foods
Look for “cassia gum” or “E427” in the ingredient list. Many makers pair it with other gums such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) to create a specific texture. If you track additives for dietary reasons, checking the label is the most reliable way to know whether a product contains E427.
