Tocopherol-rich extract (E306) is a natural mix of vitamin E compounds used as an antioxidant in foods. It helps keep oils and fats from turning rancid, so flavor and aroma last longer. On labels, you’ll often see it called “mixed tocopherols” or “tocopherol-rich extract.”

## At a glance
- What it is: A blend of vitamin E compounds (tocopherols) usually derived from vegetable oils. It works as an antioxidant that slows fat oxidation in foods.
- What it does: Helps protect flavor, aroma, and color in fat-rich foods by delaying rancidity.
- Where it’s found: Cooking oils, salad dressings, nut butters, cereal and snack bars, baked goods, seasonings, and many shelf-stable snacks.
- Names on labels: E306, tocopherol-rich extract, mixed tocopherols.
- Regulatory status: Authorized in both the United States and the European Union for use in foods as an antioxidant.

## Why is Tocopherol-rich extract added to food?
Food fats and oils can react with oxygen, causing rancid flavors and odors. Tocopherol-rich extract acts as an antioxidant, which slows this reaction and helps keep foods tasting fresh for longer. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies tocopherols as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used as antioxidants in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## What foods contain Tocopherol-rich extract?
You’re most likely to see it in foods that contain fats and oils, such as:
- Vegetable oils and spray oils
- Salad dressings and mayonnaise
- Nut and seed butters
- Granola, cereal, and snack bars
- Baked goods and baking mixes
- Seasonings and spice blends
- Snack foods like chips and crackers

It is also used to help stabilize flavors and certain oil-based ingredients.

## What can replace Tocopherol-rich extract?
Depending on the food and the desired shelf life, common alternatives include:
- Natural antioxidants such as [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive}
- Synthetic antioxidants like [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive} and [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}
- Vitamin C–based antioxidants such as [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate){.additive} or [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive}
- Other phenolic antioxidants like [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}
- Synergists that boost antioxidant systems, such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}

The best substitute depends on flavor compatibility, regulatory allowance, and whether a “natural” or “synthetic” label claim is important.

## How is Tocopherol-rich extract made?
Manufacturers typically obtain tocopherols from edible vegetable oils. During oil refining, a by-product stream called “deodorizer distillate” is collected; the tocopherols are then concentrated and purified using physical processes such as distillation and adsorption to produce a tocopherol-rich extract.[^2] In the European Union, specifications define tocopherol-rich extract as a mixture of naturally occurring tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-), with set purity and quality criteria for safe food use.[^5]

## Is Tocopherol-rich extract safe to eat?
Yes. Tocopherols are permitted antioxidants in many countries. In the U.S., the FDA lists tocopherols as GRAS when used as antioxidants in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated tocopherol-rich extract and related tocopherols and did not identify safety concerns at authorized uses and use levels.[^2]

## Does Tocopherol-rich extract have any benefits?
For foods, the main benefit is quality: it helps keep fats from going rancid, preserving flavor and aroma. Because tocopherols are forms of vitamin E, they can also contribute to vitamin E intake, a fat-soluble nutrient that helps protect cells from oxidative damage in the body.[^3] However, in foods, they are used primarily for preservation—not as a significant source of nutrition.

## Who should avoid Tocopherol-rich extract?
Most people can consume foods containing tocopherols without issue. If you take blood-thinning medications or high-dose vitamin E supplements, talk to your healthcare provider, because large supplemental doses of vitamin E can increase bleeding risk.[^3] People who avoid certain oils for personal or medical reasons should check with manufacturers, since tocopherols are commonly sourced from vegetable oils like soybean or sunflower.

## Myths & facts
- “E306 is the same as synthetic vitamin E.” Fact: E306 is a natural mixture of tocopherols from vegetable oils. By contrast, additives such as [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol){.additive} can be produced as purified forms (natural or synthetic), each with its own specification.[^5]
- “It makes food last forever.” Fact: Tocopherols slow oxidation in fats, helping with flavor stability, but they don’t stop microbial spoilage or replace refrigeration.
- “You can’t spot it on labels.” Fact: It usually appears as “mixed tocopherols,” “tocopherols,” or “E306,” and in the U.S. its preservative function is often stated in parentheses, like “to protect flavor.”[^4]

## Tocopherol-rich extract in branded foods
You’ll find it in ingredient lists as “mixed tocopherols,” “tocopherols,” “tocopherol-rich extract,” or “E306.” In the U.S., when used as a chemical preservative, labels must also disclose its function, for example, “to protect flavor” or “to preserve freshness,” as required by FDA labeling rules.[^4] If you want to confirm the source (e.g., sunflower vs. soybean), check brand FAQs or contact the manufacturer.
