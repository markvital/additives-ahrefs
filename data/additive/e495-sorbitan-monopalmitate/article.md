Sorbitan monopalmitate (E495) is an emulsifier that helps fat and water mix. It stabilizes textures in foods like spreads, sweets, and baked goods, and it works well with other emulsifiers to keep products smooth and uniform.

## At a glance
- Role: emulsifier that helps oil and water stay mixed
- Typical foods: bakery fats and mixes, confectionery, coffee creamers, whipped toppings, and some margarines
- Often used together with other emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Label names: “Sorbitan monopalmitate,” “E495,” sometimes “Span 40”
- Made from sorbitol derivatives (sorbitan) and palmitic acid
- Authorized in the European Union (EU) with official purity specifications and use rules
- Usually present at low levels to fine‑tune texture and stability

## Why is Sorbitan monopalmitate added to food?
It keeps oil and water from separating, which improves texture and appearance. In water-in-oil systems (like some spreads and fillings), it helps form a stable, smooth blend that does not leak or weep.

Food makers use E495 to improve whipping, aeration, and uniformity in products such as toppings, creams, and certain doughs. It can also help keep products stable during transport and storage by reducing separation and shrinkage.

## What foods contain Sorbitan monopalmitate?
You may find E495 in:
- Bakery fats, cake mixes, and some breads and pastries
- Confectionery and chocolate fillings
- Coffee whiteners and powdered creamers
- Whipped toppings and dessert mixes
- Spreads and some margarines
- Certain sauces and powdered mixes

Not every product in these categories uses E495; it is one option among many emulsifiers.

## What can replace Sorbitan monopalmitate?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe and the type of emulsion:
- Other sorbitan esters: [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), [sorbitan tristearate](/e492-sorbitan-tristearate), [sorbitan monolaurate](/e493-sorbitan-monolaurate), [sorbitan monooleate](/e494-sorbitan-monooleate)
- Ethoxylated sorbitan esters (polysorbates), for example [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate)
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Structuring or stabilizing gums such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- Phospholipids like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins)

The best substitute depends on whether the product is oil‑continuous (like a spread) or water‑continuous (like a dressing), and on heat, pH, and processing steps.

## How is Sorbitan monopalmitate made?
E495 consists mainly of partial esters of sorbitol and its anhydrides (called “sorbitan”) with palmitic acid, a common fatty acid. It is produced by dehydrating sorbitol to make sorbitan and then reacting it with palmitic acid to form the ester, followed by purification to meet food-grade specifications.[^2]

EU specifications define composition, identity tests, and purity limits for sorbitan monopalmitate used in food.[^2]

## Is Sorbitan monopalmitate safe to eat?
In the European Union, sorbitan monopalmitate (E495) is an authorized food additive with approved uses listed in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and detailed purity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3][^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated sorbitan esters E491–E495 in 2017 and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels; EFSA also confirmed a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for sorbitan esters.[^1]

The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has set a group ADI of 0–25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for sorbitan esters.[^4] Sorbitan esters are hydrolyzed to fatty acids and sorbitan; the fatty acids are metabolized like normal dietary fats, while most sorbitan is excreted, and very high intakes may cause temporary digestive discomfort.[^4]

Notes on terms:
- EFSA: European Food Safety Authority (EU scientific risk assessment body)
- ADI: Acceptable Daily Intake, the amount considered safe to consume every day over a lifetime
- JECFA: Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (United Nations scientific body)

## Does Sorbitan monopalmitate have any benefits?
For food makers, E495 helps:
- Maintain a stable blend of oil and water
- Improve whipping and foam stability
- Keep textures smooth and uniform during shelf life
- Work in synergy with other emulsifiers for consistent results

For shoppers, this translates into products that are less likely to separate and that have a pleasing, repeatable texture.

## Who should avoid Sorbitan monopalmitate?
- People following strict emulsifier‑free diets may choose to avoid it.
- Individuals who notice digestive upset from emulsifiers should check labels and consult a healthcare professional.
- At very high intakes, sorbitan esters can cause loose stools or mild gastrointestinal effects, which reverse when intake is reduced.[^4]
- Those with specific dietary rules (e.g., vegetarian or vegan) may wish to ask manufacturers about the source of the palmitic acid, as it can be obtained from different edible fat sources.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E‑numbers are unsafe.” Fact: An E‑number means the additive is approved for use in the EU after a safety assessment.
- Myth: “It’s the same as sorbitol sweetener.” Fact: Sorbitan monopalmitate is an emulsifier, not a sweetener like [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) or [sorbitol syrup](/e420ii-sorbitol-syrup).
- Myth: “All emulsifiers are artificial.” Fact: Some emulsifiers occur naturally or are derived from natural sources, such as [lecithins](/e322-lecithins).
- Myth: “It always comes from palm oil.” Fact: The palmitic acid used can come from different edible fat sources; check with the producer if this matters to you.

## Sorbitan monopalmitate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “Sorbitan monopalmitate,” “E495,” or sometimes “Span 40.” It is typically used at low levels alongside other emulsifiers like [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) to fine‑tune texture in products such as creamers, spreads, confectionery, and bakery items.
