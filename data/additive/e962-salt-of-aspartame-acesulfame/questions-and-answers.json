      "q": "is acesulfame potassium the same as aspartame",
      "a": "No—acesulfame potassium (E950) and aspartame (E951) are different sweeteners; E962 is a separate ingredient that combines them into a single salt to blend their properties.",

      "q": "acesulfame potassium how does it compared to aspartame",
      "a": "Acesulfame K is more heat- and shelf-stable but can have a slight bitter aftertaste, while aspartame tastes more sugar-like but is less heat-stable; E962 merges them into a roughly 350×-sweeter, more stable salt used for improved flavor.",

      "q": "acesulfame potassium is it aspartame",
      "a": "No—acesulfame potassium is not aspartame; E962 is the salt formed from both to create a combined high-intensity sweetener.",

    {
      "q": "acesulfame potassium vs aspartame which is better than",
      "a": "It depends on use: acesulfame K suits high-heat or long-shelf-life products, while aspartame is favored for a more sugar-like taste in cold/ready-to-drink items; E962 is often chosen to get both taste and stability benefits.",

    {
      "q": "aspartame and acesulfame what is it",
      "a": "Together they form aspartame-acesulfame salt (E962, Twinsweet), a high-intensity sweetener about 350× sweeter than sugar that combines the two into one ingredient for better taste and stability.",
