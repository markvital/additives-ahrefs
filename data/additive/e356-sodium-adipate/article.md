Sodium adipate (E356) is a food additive used to control acidity and keep flavors stable. It is the sodium salt of adipic acid and gives a mild, clean tartness without strong taste of its own. Food makers use it where steady pH is important, such as in powdered mixes and shelf‑stable products.

## At a glance
- What it is: the sodium salt of adipic acid, a simple dicarboxylic acid
- What it does: works as an acidity regulator and buffer to keep pH steady
- Taste: mild tartness, less sharp than citric acid
- Where it’s found: dry mixes, drinks, desserts, and other foods that need pH control
- How it’s made: neutralizing adipic acid with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate
- Status: authorized in the European Union as E356; specifications set by EU law
- Label names: “Sodium adipate” or “E356”

## Why is Sodium adipate added to food?
Manufacturers add sodium adipate to adjust and stabilize acidity (pH) so products taste the same from batch to batch and stay shelf-stable. As a buffer, it resists sudden pH changes that could alter flavor, color, or texture during storage and heating.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium adipate?
You’ll most often see sodium adipate in foods that benefit from controlled acidity and a gentle tart profile, such as:
- Powdered beverage mixes and ready-to-drink beverages
- Gelatin and dessert mixes
- Confectionery fillings and icings
- Sauces and dressings
- Processed foods where a stable pH helps flavor and texture

In the European Union, E356 is an authorized additive in the functional class of acidity regulators; permitted uses and maximum levels depend on the specific food category.[^2]

## What can replace Sodium adipate?
Depending on the recipe and target pH, common alternatives include:
- Citric-based systems such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive} for a brighter, sharper sourness
- [Malic acid](/e296-malic-acid){.additive} for a smoother, longer-lasting tartness
- [Sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate){.additive} or [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate){.additive} when buffering with a less tangy taste is desired
- The parent acid, [adipic acid](/e355-adipic-acid){.additive}, if a direct acidulant is preferable to a buffer

The right choice depends on flavor impact, target pH, solubility, and labeling needs.

## How is Sodium adipate made?
Food‑grade sodium adipate is produced by neutralizing adipic acid with a sodium base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate. The result is a sodium salt (often disodium adipate) that meets purity and identity requirements set out in European Union specifications for food additives.[^1]

## Is Sodium adipate safe to eat?
When used within approved limits, sodium adipate is considered safe by international and European authorities. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as adipic acid, which covers its sodium salts.[^3] In the EU, E356 is authorized as a food additive and must meet defined specifications.[^2][^1]

In the United States, the parent acid, adipic acid, is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for specified uses, reflecting the longstanding safety evaluation of the adipate group.[^4]

ADI means the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. As with any additive, staying within legal use levels helps keep intake well below the ADI.

## Does Sodium adipate have any benefits?
Sodium adipate does not provide nutritional benefits. Its value is technological:
- Helps keep flavors, colors, and textures steady by buffering pH
- Offers a gentle sourness without overpowering other tastes
- Works well in dry mixes because it is stable and non‑hygroscopic (doesn’t readily absorb moisture)

## Who should avoid Sodium adipate?
- People on strict low‑sodium diets may wish to limit foods with sodium salts, including sodium adipate, as part of overall sodium management.
- Individuals with diagnosed sensitivities to acidulants should consult a healthcare professional if they notice symptoms after acidic foods.

For infants and other vulnerable groups, follow applicable dietary guidance and product age recommendations.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium adipate is a preservative.  
  Fact: It is an acidity regulator and buffer; while pH control can support shelf stability, sodium adipate itself is not a preservative.

- Myth: It’s the same as industrial plasticizers.  
  Fact: Food‑grade sodium adipate is a simple sodium salt of adipic acid. It is different from adipate esters used as plasticizers in non‑food applications, with separate specifications and regulations.[^1]

- Myth: It isn’t allowed in the EU.  
  Fact: It is authorized in the European Union as E356 under the Food Additives Regulation.[^2]

## Sodium adipate in branded foods
On labels, look for “Sodium adipate” or “E356.” It may appear alongside other acidity regulators, such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}. Because usage levels are low and it has a mild taste, it seldom stands out in the flavor, but it helps products stay consistent from the first serving to the last.
