      "a": "No—tricalcium phosphate (E341iii) and tricalcium citrate (E333iii) are different calcium salts; citrate is more soluble and mainly used as a sequestrant/stabilizer and calcium fortificant, while phosphate is often an anti-caking agent and fortificant.",

      "q": "which is better calcium citrate vs tricalcium phosphate",
      "a": "For calcium supplementation/absorption, calcium citrate is often preferred because it’s more soluble and can be taken with or without food; tricalcium phosphate is less soluble but useful in foods as an anti-caking agent and when added phosphorus is desired.",
