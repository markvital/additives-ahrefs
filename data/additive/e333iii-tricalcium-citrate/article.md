Tricalcium citrate (E333III) is a calcium salt of citric acid used to keep foods stable and to bind metal ions that could spoil taste or color. It also serves as a source of calcium in fortified foods and drinks. You might see it on labels as “tricalcium citrate,” “calcium citrate,” or simply “E333.”

## At a glance
- What it is: a calcium salt of citric acid used as a stabiliser and sequestrant
- What it does: helps keep texture, binds metal ions, and can add calcium
- Where it’s found: fortified beverages, plant-based milks, yogurts, drink mixes, and some candies
- Label names: tricalcium citrate, calcium citrate, E333
- Taste/texture: neutral taste; fine white powder
- Solubility: dissolves better in acidic liquids than in neutral ones
- Regulatory status: evaluated in the EU and used in many countries for the stated functions

## Why is Tricalcium citrate added to food?
Tricalcium citrate is added mainly as a stabiliser and sequestrant. A stabiliser helps maintain texture and consistency so products don’t separate or get gritty. A sequestrant binds trace metal ions (like iron or copper) that can cause off-flavors, discoloration, or loss of freshness. In many products, it also works as a calcium source for fortification. EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) has evaluated calcium citrates, including E333, for these uses in food.[^1]

## What foods contain Tricalcium citrate?
You’ll most often see tricalcium citrate in:
- Calcium-fortified juices and nectars
- Plant-based milks (oat, almond, soy)
- Drinking yogurts and cultured dairy
- Powdered drink mixes and instant beverages
- Confectionery and chewables where added calcium is desired

On ingredient lists, it may appear alongside other citrates such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}.

## What can replace Tricalcium citrate?
Alternatives depend on the job you want done:
- For calcium fortification: [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate){.additive} or [tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate){.additive}
- For buffering or chelating (binding metals): [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}, or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates){.additive}

Each option behaves a bit differently in taste, solubility, and how it changes acidity.

## How is Tricalcium citrate made?
Tricalcium citrate is typically produced by neutralising food-grade [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} with a calcium source such as [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate){.additive} or calcium hydroxide. The reaction forms calcium citrate, which is filtered, washed, and dried to meet food purity standards. EU specifications set identity and purity criteria for E333, including limits on moisture and impurities.[^2]

## Is Tricalcium citrate safe to eat?
In the EU re‑evaluation of citrates, EFSA concluded there was no safety concern for calcium citrates (E333) at reported use levels in foods.[^1] In the United States, calcium citrate appears on FDA’s Food Additive Status List and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used as intended.[^3]

Because it contributes dietary calcium, normal safe use also depends on total calcium intake from all sources. Very high calcium intakes over time can cause health issues; health authorities set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for calcium to guide safe totals.[^4]

## Does Tricalcium citrate have any benefits?
Yes. Its main benefit is supplying calcium for bone health when used to fortify foods. Calcium citrate is a well-absorbed form and can be taken with or without food, which is useful for people with lower stomach acid. Still, the body absorbs calcium best in smaller doses spread across the day.[^4]

## Who should avoid Tricalcium citrate?
- People who must limit calcium for medical reasons (for example, those with hypercalcemia) should monitor total calcium from diet, water, supplements, and fortified foods.[^4]
- People taking certain medicines that interact with calcium (some antibiotics and thyroid medicines) should separate dosing from calcium-containing foods or supplements, per medical advice.[^4]
- Anyone with a prescribed low-mineral diet should follow their clinician’s guidance.

Most people can consume tricalcium citrate in normal food amounts without issues.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}.” Fact: It’s a calcium salt of citric acid, used for different reasons (stability, calcium fortification).
- Myth: “It makes food very sour.” Fact: Tricalcium citrate is nearly tasteless; it buffers acidity rather than adding strong sourness.
- Myth: “All citrates are identical.” Fact: Different citrates, like [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive} and [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates){.additive}, behave differently in taste, solubility, and sodium/potassium content.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: It doesn’t preserve by killing microbes; it helps protect quality by binding metals and stabilising texture.

## Tricalcium citrate in branded foods
You’ll commonly find it on labels of:
- “Calcium-fortified” orange juice and other fruit drinks
- Shelf-stable and refrigerated plant-based milks
- Drinkable yogurts and dairy blends
- Powdered beverage mixes and sports drink powders
- Chewable candies and lozenges with added calcium

Look for “tricalcium citrate,” “calcium citrate,” or “E333” in the ingredient list.
