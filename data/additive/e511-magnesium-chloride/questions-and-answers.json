      "q": "is magnesium chloride good for you",
      "a": "In foods, E511 simply provides magnesium—an essential mineral—and is considered safe at typical levels; it doesn’t confer special benefits beyond helping meet magnesium needs. Very high supplemental intakes can cause diarrhea and are risky for people with kidney problems.",

      "q": "is magnesium chloride safe for concrete",
      "a": "No—magnesium chloride de-icer can chemically degrade concrete over time (and promote rebar corrosion), especially on new or poorly sealed surfaces; alternatives are preferred for long-term concrete durability.",
