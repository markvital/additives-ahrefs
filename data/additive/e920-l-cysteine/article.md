L-cysteine (E920) is an amino acid used in food as a dough conditioner and flour treatment agent. It helps make dough easier to handle and is sometimes used as a flavoring aid. You will often see it on labels as “L-cysteine” or “L-cysteine hydrochloride.”

## At a glance
- Role: dough conditioner and flour treatment agent that helps with dough handling
- Where found: commercial bread, buns, tortillas, pizza dough, pastries, and some flavorings
- Other names on labels: L-cysteine, L-cysteine HCl, E920
- Usual levels: used under good manufacturing practice (very small amounts)
- Source: made by fermentation or by breaking down keratin-rich materials (such as feathers); the molecule is the same regardless of source

## Why is l-cysteine added to food?
L-cysteine is added to improve how dough behaves. It acts as a reducing agent, which helps make dough more extensible and can shorten mixing time. It is also permitted for use as a flavoring agent and adjuvant in foods.[^1][^4]

## What foods contain l-cysteine?
You are most likely to find L-cysteine in:
- Packaged bread and buns
- Pizza dough and flatbreads (including tortillas)
- Some pastries and croissants
- Certain flavorings and seasonings, where it functions as a flavoring aid

As a flour treatment agent (INS 920), it is used in line with good manufacturing practice rather than at set maximum levels.[^2]

## What can replace l-cysteine?
Depending on the product and process, bakers may choose:
- Oxidizing or strengthening agents such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive}
- Other dough conditioners like [DATEM](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}
- Enzymes, for example [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase){.additive} or [lipase](/e1104-lipase){.additive}
- Reducing agents such as [sodium metabisulphite](/e223-sodium-metabisulphite){.additive}
- Texture modifiers like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}

Choice depends on the flour quality, desired texture, and baking method.

## How is l-cysteine made?
Commercial L-cysteine can be produced by:
- Fermentation using microorganisms
- Hydrolysis of keratin-rich materials (for example, feathers or other keratin sources)

Both processes yield the same chemical compound, L-cysteine.[^4] In the European Union, E 920 covers L-cysteine and its hydrochloride, with specifications set for identity and purity.[^3]

## Is l-cysteine safe to eat?
In the United States, L-cysteine monohydrochloride is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as a dough conditioner, nutrient supplement, and flavoring agent, when used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice.[^1] Globally, the Codex Alimentarius lists L-cysteine (INS 920) as a flour treatment agent permitted under good manufacturing practice.[^2] The EU sets official specifications for E 920 (L-cysteine and its hydrochloride), which defines the substance used in foods.[^3]

## Does l-cysteine have any benefits?
For bakers, L-cysteine can:
- Improve dough handling and consistency
- Help make dough more extensible and reduce mixing time
- Support specific flavor development when used as a flavoring aid

These are recognized food-use functions for L-cysteine/L-cysteine hydrochloride in regulations and technical summaries.[^1][^4]

## Who should avoid l-cysteine?
- Vegetarians, vegans, and people with religious dietary rules may wish to verify the source (fermentation vs. keratin-derived) with the manufacturer.
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit sulfur-containing amino acids for medical reasons, ask whether foods with E920 fit your plan.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E920 is always made from human hair.” Fact: L-cysteine can be made by fermentation or from keratin sources; the molecule is identical regardless of source.[^4]
- Myth: “E920 is the same as MSG.” Fact: L-cysteine is a different amino acid and serves different functions; in the U.S. it is affirmed as GRAS for use as a dough conditioner, nutrient supplement, and flavoring agent.[^1]
- Myth: “E920 is a preservative.” Fact: Its primary approved function is as a flour treatment agent/dough conditioner, not as a preservative.[^2]

## l-cysteine in branded foods
Look for “L-cysteine,” “L-cysteine hydrochloride,” or “E920” on ingredient lists. It most often appears in mass-produced breads, buns, tortillas, pizza bases, and some pastries. Flavorings may also list it when used as a flavoring aid. If the source matters to you, contact the brand’s consumer line to ask whether their L-cysteine is produced by fermentation.
