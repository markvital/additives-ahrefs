Ammonium lactate (E328) is the ammonium salt of lactic acid. In foods, it works mainly as an acidity regulator and buffering agent that helps keep flavor and pH steady.

## At a glance
- E-number: E328; name on labels: ammonium lactate
- What it does: controls acidity and buffers pH; adds mild tang
- Typical uses: drinks, sauces, confectionery, and bakery-style foods
- Related additives: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid){.additive}, [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate){.additive}, [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate){.additive}, [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate){.additive}
- Dietary notes: contains no lactose; sodium-free option for pH control

## Why is ammonium lactate added to food?
Food makers use ammonium lactate to adjust and stabilize acidity. That helps keep taste consistent from batch to batch and can support shelf quality by holding the pH in a preferred range.[^1] In the European Union (EU), it is an authorised food additive for use under the general food additive regulation framework.[^2]

## What foods contain ammonium lactate?
You may find E328 in foods where a gentle sour note or tight pH control is useful, for example:
- Soft drinks, flavored waters, and ready-to-drink teas
- Fruit-based products, jams, and dessert toppings
- Confectionery and chewing gum
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades
- Bakery-style products and fillings

Actual use depends on recipe and local rules, so it will not appear in every product in these groups. Always check the ingredient list for “ammonium lactate” or “E328.”

## What can replace ammonium lactate?
Depending on the job in the recipe, common substitutes include:
- Other lactates: [sodium lactate](/e325-sodium-lactate){.additive}, [potassium lactate](/e326-potassium-lactate){.additive}, or [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate){.additive} for similar pH control
- Acids and buffers: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid){.additive}, [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, or [sodium citrate](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive} when a different sour profile or buffering capacity is desired
- Vinegar choices: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive} or vinegar for a sharper flavor direction

## How is ammonium lactate made?
Ammonium lactate is produced by neutralizing lactic acid with ammonia (ammonium hydroxide), then meeting purity specifications set for food additives.[^3] Commercial lactic acid is typically obtained by fermenting sugars from carbohydrate sources, followed by purification; the neutralized salt is then prepared under controlled conditions for food use.[^4]

## Is ammonium lactate safe to eat?
Within the EU, ammonium lactate has official identity and purity criteria and may be used in foods as regulated, which means it has passed a safety evaluation process for its intended uses.[^1][^2] JECFA (the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) also publishes a specification monograph for ammonium lactate used in food, covering identity and quality.[^3]

## Does ammonium lactate have any benefits?
- Taste shaping: provides a mild sour note without the sharpness of some other acids.
- Stable pH: buffers recipes so flavor and texture remain consistent over shelf life.
- Sodium-free: offers pH control without adding sodium, useful in products targeting reduced-sodium profiles.

## Who should avoid ammonium lactate?
Most people can consume foods containing E328 as part of a normal diet. However:
- If you follow a medically supervised diet that restricts ammonium salts, ask your healthcare professional about this additive.
- For infants and young children, additive use is more tightly controlled in the EU, so caregivers should check labels carefully.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- “Lactate” is not “lactose.” Lactate is a salt of lactic acid and contains no milk sugar.
- Lactic acid is commonly made by fermenting plant sugars. It is not the same as “lactic” from milk, and the presence of ammonium lactate does not mean a food contains dairy proteins.
- Ammonium lactate is different from leavening agents like ammonium bicarbonate; E328 is used mainly for acidity control, not to make dough rise.

## ammonium lactate in branded foods
On labels, look for “ammonium lactate” or “E328.” You might see it in flavored beverages, sweets, sauces, and some bakery-style items. Its presence and amount depend on brand formulation and local rules, so products can vary.
