Calcium malates (E352) are the calcium salts of malic acid, used to control acidity in foods and drinks. They help stabilize flavor, color, and texture by keeping pH in a steady range and by binding trace metals that could cause off-notes.

## At a glance
- Name: Calcium malates (E352); includes E352(i) calcium malate and E352(ii) calcium hydrogen malate
- What it does: Acidity regulator and sequestrant (binds metal ions)
- Where it’s used: Common in beverages, fruit-based products, confectionery, and bakery items
- Made from: Neutralizing malic acid with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide
- Also known as: A “malate” is a salt of [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid)
- Diet: Typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets

## Why is Calcium malates added to food?
Manufacturers use calcium malates to adjust and stabilize acidity (pH), which helps preserve taste, color, and texture. They also act as sequestrants, meaning they bind metal ions that can otherwise catalyze flavor or color changes in foods and drinks. These are recognized technological functions for the malates group. [^1]

## What foods contain Calcium malates?
You may find E352 in non-alcoholic beverages, fruit preparations (like fillings and jams), confectionery, and baked goods—places where steady acidity and flavor stability matter. In the European Union, calcium malates are authorized as food additives, with their permitted uses and any conditions set out in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and its annexes. [^3]

## What can replace Calcium malates?
Depending on the recipe goal:
- For similar tartness and pH control: [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- For the “malate” function but with other cations: [sodium malates](/e350-sodium-malates), [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate)
- When calcium fortification is also desired: [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates), [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate), [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate)

The best substitute depends on taste profile, buffering capacity, labeling goals, and mineral contribution.

## How is Calcium malates made?
Calcium malates are produced by neutralizing [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) with a calcium base such as [calcium carbonate](/e170-calcium-carbonates) or [calcium hydroxide](/e526-calcium-hydroxide). The degree of neutralization determines whether the product is calcium malate (E352(i)) or calcium hydrogen malate (E352(ii)). This method and the specifications for identity and purity are laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012. [^2]

## Is Calcium malates safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated malic acid (E 296) and the malates (E 350–352) and concluded there is no safety concern for their use as food additives at the reported levels. EFSA did not identify genotoxic or carcinogenic concerns and considered that a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not necessary for current uses. [^1]

## Does Calcium malates have any benefits?
For food makers, calcium malates provide steady, buffered acidity and help protect flavor and color by binding trace metals. For consumers, they may contribute small amounts of calcium to the diet, though the actual calcium contribution depends on how much is added to the specific food.

## Who should avoid Calcium malates?
Most people don’t need to avoid E352. However, individuals who have been told to limit calcium (for example, due to hypercalcemia or certain kidney conditions) should check labels and consult their healthcare provider about total calcium intake from all sources. [^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E352 is the same as malic acid.” Fact: Calcium malates are salts of malic acid; they act similarly to adjust acidity but are not the same compound.
- Myth: “It’s just a synthetic chemical.” Fact: Malates are derived from malic acid, an organic acid that also occurs naturally in many fruits; food-grade additives are manufactured for consistency and purity.
- Myth: “It always adds a lot of calcium.” Fact: Amounts vary by recipe; check the Nutrition Facts panel to see if the product makes a meaningful contribution.

## Calcium malates in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “calcium malate,” “calcium hydrogen malate,” or “E352.” Because it’s used mainly to manage acidity and stability, you’re most likely to see it in drinks, fruit-based foods, sweets, and some baked goods. If you’re tracking calcium intake, use both the ingredient list and the nutrition panel.
