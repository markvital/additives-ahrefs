      "q": "is citric acid bad for you",
      "a": "At typical food levels, citric acid (E330) is considered safe by major regulators (GRAS; EFSA/JECFA). Concentrated or frequent acidic exposure can irritate the mouth/stomach or contribute to tooth enamel erosion.",

      "q": "where does the citric acid cycle occur",
      "a": "In eukaryotic cells it occurs in the mitochondrial matrix; in bacteria it occurs in the cytosol.",

      "q": "what does citric acid do to your body",
      "a": "It is a normal intermediate in energy metabolism and is readily metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. Citrate can bind minerals, which may enhance absorption of some and help prevent certain kidney stones by increasing urinary citrate.",

      "q": "where does citric acid come from",

    {
      "q": "how is citric acid made",
      "a": "Industrially, sugars are fermented with Aspergillus niger to produce citric acid, then it is recovered and purifiedâ€”often by precipitating calcium citrate and converting it back with sulfuric acid or via ion-exchange/crystallization.",
