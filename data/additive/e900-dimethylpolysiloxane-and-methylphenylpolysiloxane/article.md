Dimethylpolysiloxane and methylphenylpolysiloxane (E900) are silicone oils used in very small amounts to control foam and sometimes to give foods a smooth, glossy surface. They help keep fryers steady and processing tanks calm so foods cook and fill more evenly.

## At a glance
- What it is: Food‑grade silicone oils grouped under E900
- Main job: Antifoaming (prevents boil-overs and foam); sometimes a glazing agent
- Where you’ll see it: Frying oils, sugar syrups, jams, juices, breweries, and other foam‑prone processes
- Texture effect: Keeps bubbles down without changing taste
- Regulatory status: Permitted in the U.S. and EU under strict purity rules

## Why is Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane added to food?
Foam slows down cooking, causes messy boil‑overs, and makes filling bottles and jars less accurate. E900 breaks foam quickly, so lines run smoother and safer.[^1] In the EU, E900 (covering dimethylpolysiloxane and methylphenylpolysiloxane) is an authorised food additive with defined identity and purity criteria.[^2]

## What foods contain Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane?
You’re most likely to find it where hot oils or vigorous mixing create foam:
- Frying oils used for snacks and restaurant frying
- Sugar syrups, jams, jellies, and fruit prep
- Juice, wine, and beer processing tanks
- Other high‑aeration steps, like blanching or evaporation

On labels, it may appear as “E900,” “dimethylpolysiloxane,” or “methylphenylpolysiloxane.” In the U.S., when used only as a processing aid and not present at functional levels in the finished food, it may be exempt from ingredient labeling, so you might not always see it listed.[^5]

## What can replace Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane?
Depending on the process and food, manufacturers may switch to:
- Food oils and emulsifiers that suppress foam, such as [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive} or [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}[^1]
- Certain fatty‑acid esters like [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or [propane‑1,2‑diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive}[^1]
- If a glossy finish is the goal, alternatives include [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive} or [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive} for glazing, depending on the product

The “best” replacement depends on the food, temperature, and whether the additive must be declared on the label.

## How is Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane made?
Both are silicone polymers. Dimethylpolysiloxane is formed by hydrolyzing dimethyldichlorosilane to siloxane units and then polymerizing them into a viscous oil. Methylphenylpolysiloxane is made the same way but starts from chlorosilanes that include phenyl (ring) groups, which tweak performance at high temperatures.[^3]

## Is Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane safe to eat?
International expert reviews report low oral absorption and no safety concern at the levels used in food; dimethylpolysiloxane has an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of “not specified,” indicating low toxicity at typical use levels.[^3] In the EU, E900 must meet tight specifications, including limits on certain low‑molecular‑weight siloxane impurities.[^2]

## Does Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane have any benefits?
Its benefits are practical, not nutritional:
- Reduces splatter and boil‑overs during cooking
- Helps keep fill volumes and textures consistent
- Can improve fryer stability and reduce waste oil

## Who should avoid Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane?
Most people don’t need to avoid E900. If you prefer foods without silicone‑based processing aids, choose products that don’t list E900 or buy minimally processed items. Keep in mind that, in the U.S., processing aids sometimes don’t appear on labels, so you may need to contact the manufacturer to be sure.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s basically the same as hardware‑store silicone caulk.”  
  Fact: Food‑grade E900 must meet strict identity and purity specifications set in law.[^2]
- Myth: “It gets absorbed and builds up in the body.”  
  Fact: Evaluations report very limited absorption and low toxicity at permitted uses.[^3]
- Myth: “Foods are loaded with it.”  
  Fact: It’s used in tiny amounts, just enough to stop foam during processing.

## Dimethylpolysiloxane and Methylphenylpolysiloxane in branded foods
Look on ingredient lists for “E900,” “dimethylpolysiloxane,” or “methylphenylpolysiloxane.” Company websites and customer service lines can also confirm use. Note that in the U.S., when E900 functions only as a processing aid and is not present at functional levels in the finished food, it may be exempt from ingredient labeling.[^5]
