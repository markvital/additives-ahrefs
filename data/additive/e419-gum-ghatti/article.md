Gum ghatti (E419) is a natural plant gum used to steady mixtures and add gentle thickness in foods and drinks. It comes from the sap of the ghatti tree and is valued for keeping flavors and oils evenly mixed.

## At a glance
- E-number: E419; natural gum from the ghatti tree
- Main roles: stabiliser and thickener
- Common in: beverage emulsions, sweets, sauces, and dressings
- Regulatory status: authorised in the European Union with set purity specs
- Label names: “gum ghatti,” “E419,” or “ghatti gum”

## Why is gum ghatti added to food?
Food makers use gum ghatti to keep oil and water mixed, prevent separation, and give products a smooth, stable texture. In technical terms, it acts as a stabiliser and thickener, and it is also known for its emulsifying ability in flavor oil systems for drinks.[^2]

## What foods contain gum ghatti?
You may find gum ghatti in:
- Flavored soft drinks and syrups (especially where oils need to stay dispersed)
- Confectionery such as chewy candies and glazes
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades that need stable texture
- Powdered mixes where fine particles should stay suspended

On labels, look for “gum ghatti” or “E419.”

## What can replace gum ghatti?
Depending on the recipe, common substitutes include other hydrocolloids (water-loving gums) such as:
- [gum arabic](/e414-acacia-gum){.additive} (acacia gum)
- [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}
- [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}
- [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}
- [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- [tara gum](/e417-tara-gum){.additive}
- [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}

Each gum behaves a bit differently, so the best swap depends on whether you need emulsifying power, viscosity, or freeze–thaw stability.

## How is gum ghatti made?
Gum ghatti is a natural exudate: the sap that oozes from cuts in the trunk and branches of the ghatti tree (Anogeissus latifolia). The dried gum “tears” are collected, sorted to remove bark and other matter, then cleaned and milled into a food-grade powder that meets purity limits for moisture, ash, and minerals set in the European Union’s additive specifications.[^1]

## Is gum ghatti safe to eat?
Gum ghatti is authorised as a food additive in the European Union with the designation E419, meaning it has passed a safety evaluation and must meet strict quality specifications when used in foods.[^1] It is also listed by the Codex Alimentarius system (set by FAO/WHO) for use in foods as an emulsifier, stabiliser, and thickener, which reflects international evaluation of its safety for intended uses.[^2] In the EU, which regulates how and where additives may be used, gum ghatti’s permitted uses and levels are defined under the food additives framework law.[^3]

## Does gum ghatti have any benefits?
For food makers, gum ghatti can:
- Stabilise flavor oil emulsions in beverages so they stay clear and uniform
- Improve texture and reduce separation in sauces and dressings
- Help suspend particles and protect flavors during processing and shelf life[^2]

For consumers, the benefit is consistent texture and taste over a product’s shelf life.

## Who should avoid gum ghatti?
- People who have been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid certain thickeners or gums should check labels.
- Anyone who suspects a sensitivity to plant gums should discuss this with an allergist or physician before consuming products that list E419.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: All food gums are synthetic. Fact: Gum ghatti is a natural exudate from a tree.
- Myth: Gums always make food “gel-like.” Fact: At typical levels, gum ghatti mainly stabilises emulsions and gently thickens; it does not usually form a firm gel.
- Myth: If two products list the same gum, they will have the same texture. Fact: Texture depends on the full recipe, processing, and how much gum is used.

## Gum ghatti in branded foods
You can spot gum ghatti on ingredient labels as “gum ghatti” or “E419.” It appears in a range of products, especially flavored beverages and confectionery where oils or particles must stay evenly mixed. If you are tracking intake of stabilisers and thickeners, read ingredient lists and, when available, manufacturer FAQs.
