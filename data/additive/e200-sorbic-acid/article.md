Sorbic acid (E200) is a common food preservative that helps stop molds and yeasts from growing. It works best in slightly acidic foods and has been used safely for decades in many everyday products. It often appears on ingredient lists as sorbic acid or simply E200.

## At a glance
- Role: Preservative that slows mold and yeast growth
- Typical foods: Cheeses, baked goods, beverages, condiments, dried fruits
- Label names: Sorbic acid, E200; related salts include [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} and [sodium sorbate](/e201-sodium-sorbate){.additive}
- Taste/appearance: White, slightly acidic solid; mild taste
- Solubility: Slightly soluble in water; salts are more soluble
- Works best: In acidic foods (lower pH)

## Why is Sorbic acid added to food?
Food makers add sorbic acid to prevent spoilage from molds and yeasts, helping food stay fresher for longer. It is particularly effective in acidic foods because more of the preservative remains in its active, undissociated form at lower pH. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) classifies sorbic acid (E200) as a preservative and has evaluated its safety and function in foods.[^2]

## What foods contain Sorbic acid?
You’ll most often see sorbic acid in foods that are prone to mold or yeast growth:
- Dairy and cheese (including surface treatments on cheeses)
- Baked goods and tortillas
- Fruit products and fruit-flavored drinks
- Sauces, dressings, and condiments
- Dried fruits and confections

In the European Union, sorbic acid (E200) is listed as a permitted food additive in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, which sets the framework for where and how it can be used.[^5]

## What can replace Sorbic acid?
Alternatives depend on the recipe, pH, and moisture of the food:
- Sorbate salts: [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} and [sodium sorbate](/e201-sodium-sorbate){.additive} offer similar protection, with better water solubility
- Benzoates: [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid){.additive} and [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} for acidic foods
- Propionates: [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} for bakery items
- Natural antimicrobials: [natamycin](/e235-natamycin){.additive} for cheeses; [nisin](/e234-nisin){.additive} for certain dairy and canned foods
- Acidulants to lower pH and boost preservative action: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive}

## How is Sorbic acid made?
Commercial sorbic acid is produced synthetically to tight purity specifications. In the EU, its official specification states it is made by condensing crotonaldehyde with ketene, followed by processing to yield sorbic acid of defined purity and limits for impurities.[^3] Its identity as 2,4-hexadienoic acid (trans,trans) is also documented in public chemical databases.[^4]

## Is Sorbic acid safe to eat?
In the United States, sorbic acid is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use in foods when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, EFSA has reevaluated sorbic acid (E200) and concluded it is safe at the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as sorbic acid.[^2] Sorbic acid is readily metabolized by the body via normal fatty-acid pathways to carbon dioxide and water.[^4]

## Does Sorbic acid have any benefits?
- Helps keep foods free of molds and yeasts, extending shelf life
- Supports food safety and quality in products that are otherwise prone to spoilage
- Can reduce food waste by slowing visible spoilage

These are technological benefits to the food; sorbic acid is not added for nutrition or taste.

## Who should avoid Sorbic acid?
Most people can consume foods containing sorbic acid without issues when it’s used within legal limits. Individuals who believe they are sensitive to sorbates (for example, experiencing irritation or hives after exposure) should consult a healthcare professional and check labels for “sorbic acid,” “E200,” or related salts such as [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sorbic acid is the same as vitamin C.” Fact: Vitamin C is ascorbic acid; sorbic acid is a different compound with a preservative role.
- Myth: “Sorbic acid is only natural if it comes from berries.” Fact: While first identified in rowan berries, food-grade sorbic acid is typically made synthetically under strict specifications.[^3]
- Myth: “Preservatives always make food unsafe.” Fact: Regulators review preservatives for safety and set limits; sorbic acid is GRAS in the U.S. and has an EFSA-reviewed ADI in the EU.[^1][^2]

## Sorbic acid in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll see it as “sorbic acid” or “E200.” It commonly appears in sliced bread and tortillas, shredded cheese and cheese coatings, fruit drinks, ciders, sauces, salad dressings, and certain confections. Related salts like [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} are often chosen when higher water solubility is needed.
