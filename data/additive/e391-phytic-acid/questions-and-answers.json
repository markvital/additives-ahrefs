      "q": "how long to soak oats to remove phytic acid",
      "a": "About 12–24 hours in warm water with a little acid (e.g., yogurt or lemon) plus a phytase source such as rye flour or sourdough can substantially reduce phytic acid; a plain cold overnight soak removes relatively little.",

      "q": "how to remove phytic acid from oats",
      "a": "Soak oats 12–24 hours in warm water with a small amount of acid and a phytase-rich addition (e.g., rye flour or sourdough), then cook and discard the soak water; this activates enzymes that break down phytic acid. Fermenting into a sour porridge or sprouting also helps, while plain soaking alone is less effective.",

      "q": "does white rice have phytic acid",
      "a": "Yes, but at much lower levels than brown rice because most phytic acid is in the bran and germ that are removed during polishing; white rice typically contains only trace-to-low amounts.",

      "q": "how long to soak cashews to remove phytic acid",
      "a": "Soak 2–4 hours to soften and reduce a little phytic acid; extending to 8–12 hours in warm, lightly salted or acidic water may help slightly more, but significant reduction usually requires additional steps like boiling or roasting.",

    {
      "q": "how to soak oats to remove phytic acid",
      "a": "Cover oats with warm water, add a spoonful of acidic medium (yogurt/lemon) and a phytase source (rye flour or sourdough), soak 12–24 hours, then cook and discard the soaking liquid for best phytic acid reduction.",
