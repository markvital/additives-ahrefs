Phytic acid (E391) is a natural compound found in whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. In food technology, it’s known for binding minerals and can act as a chelating (sequestering) agent, although it appears on labels infrequently.

## At a glance
- E-number: E391; common names: phytic acid, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6).
- What it does: binds metal ions like iron and copper (a “chelating” or “sequestering” agent), which can influence color, flavor, and stability in foods.
- Where it occurs: naturally present in the bran/germ of cereals, pulses, nuts, and seeds.
- Nutrition note: phytic acid can reduce the absorption of minerals such as iron and zinc when eaten in the same meal.
- Labeling: when used as an additive, it may appear as “phytic acid,” “phytate,” or “E391,” but this is uncommon in everyday foods.

## Why is Phytic acid added to food?
Phytic acid binds metal ions (for example, iron and copper) very strongly. In recipes and manufactured foods, this “metal-grabbing” action can help control reactions that cause off-flavors, browning, or discoloration, so it may be used as a chelating/sequestering aid in certain formulations.[^1]

## What foods contain Phytic acid?
- Natural sources: whole and unrefined plant foods. It is abundant in the bran of grains, beans, lentils, peanuts, and other nuts and seeds.[^2] These foods are nutritious, but the phytate they contain can inhibit iron absorption from the same meal.[^2]
- Zinc is affected too: diets high in unrefined cereals and legumes can reduce zinc absorption because of phytate.[^3]
- As an additive: you will only occasionally see “phytic acid,” “phytate,” or “E391” on ingredient lists; most exposure in typical diets comes from the natural phytate present in plant foods.

## What can replace Phytic acid?
Depending on the job:
- For chelating/sequestering metal ions: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate) are commonly used alternatives.
- For antioxidant support or color/flavor protection: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) can help in many foods.
- For binding minerals in processed meats and seafoods: [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates) are often used.

## How is Phytic acid made?
In nature, plants make phytic acid by adding phosphate groups to myo‑inositol, then store it in seeds and bran as their main phosphorus reserve.[^4] That is why whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds naturally contain the highest amounts.[^4]

## Is Phytic acid safe to eat?
Phytic acid is a normal part of many plant foods and is safe for most people as part of a balanced diet. The main nutritional concern is not toxicity but reduced mineral absorption—especially nonheme iron (the form in plants). Vitamin C (for example, from fruit or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)-rich foods) and animal protein can counter this iron inhibition when eaten in the same meal.[^2] Phytate can also lower zinc absorption, particularly in diets that rely heavily on unrefined cereals and legumes without enhancers of absorption.[^3]

## Does Phytic acid have any benefits?
- Technological: as a strong chelating agent, it can help manage metal-catalyzed reactions that lead to rancidity or discoloration in some formulations.[^1]
- Botanical: in plants, it safely stores phosphorus and minerals for the seed, which explains its natural presence in many staple foods.[^4]
- Nutrition context: foods that contain phytic acid (whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds) also provide fiber, protein, and micronutrients; overall diet quality matters more than the presence of a single compound.

## Who should avoid Phytic acid?
- People with iron deficiency or at high risk of it may want to limit high-phytate side dishes during iron-rich meals, or pair those meals with vitamin C sources to improve iron absorption.[^5]
- People at risk of zinc deficiency (for example, those eating diets very high in unrefined cereals/legumes with few enhancers) should be mindful of phytate’s effect on zinc absorption.[^6]
If you have a diagnosed deficiency, a clinician or dietitian can tailor meal timing and preparation to your needs.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Phytic acid is a toxin.” Fact: it is a natural plant compound found in many healthy foods.
- Myth: “You must cut out all phytate.” Fact: most people do fine including whole grains and legumes; the focus should be on overall diet and smart pairing to support mineral absorption.
- Myth: “Phytic acid always causes deficiencies.” Fact: risk depends on the whole diet; vitamin C, leavening/fermentation, and food choices can offset its effects on iron and zinc.

## Phytic acid in branded foods
You will seldom see E391 on everyday labels. If present, it may appear as “phytic acid,” “phytate,” or a specific salt such as “sodium phytate.” Check ingredient lists on specialized beverages, supplements, or fortified products where metal chelation or color stabilization might be desired.
