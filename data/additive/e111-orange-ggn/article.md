Orange GGN (E111) is a synthetic orange food dye that was used historically to color foods and drinks. It is not currently authorized for use in foods in the European Union or the United States, so you should not see it on ingredient lists in those regions.[^1][^2]

## At a glance
- Additive: Orange GGN
- E-number: E111
- What it does: Synthetic orange color
- Current status: Not authorized for use in foods in the EU or the U.S.[^1][^2]
- Typical labels: “E111” or “Orange GGN”

## Why is Orange GGN added to food?
Manufacturers used Orange GGN to give products a bright orange color. Color helps foods look consistent from batch to batch and can make flavors seem stronger. Today, other approved colors are used instead.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Orange GGN?
You should not find Orange GGN in foods sold in the EU or the U.S., because only listed color additives may be used and E111 is not on those lists.[^1][^2] Historically, orange dyes like this were used in sweets, drinks, and desserts, but modern products use approved alternatives.

## What can replace Orange GGN?
If a recipe or product once used Orange GGN, common substitutes include:
- Approved synthetic colors such as [Sunset Yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf){.additive} or [Tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine){.additive}, when permitted for the food type and within legal limits.[^2][^3]
- Natural colors such as [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive} or [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, chosen for a similar shade and stability profile.[^3]

## How is Orange GGN made?
Orange GGN is a man-made dye produced by chemical synthesis. It is not extracted from plants or animals. Commercial food color manufacturing aims for consistent shade, solubility, and stability, but in this case the dye is not authorized for food use in major markets.[^1][^2]

## Is Orange GGN safe to eat?
Major regulators do not permit E111 in food. In the U.S., only color additives that are listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be used in food; Orange GGN is not listed.[^1] In the EU, only additives on the Union list (Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008) are allowed; Orange GGN does not appear on that list.[^2] Because it is not authorized, there is no established food-use specification under the EU additive specifications regulation.[^3]

## Does Orange GGN have any benefits?
Aside from coloring, there are no nutritional benefits. Any coloring function can be achieved using approved alternatives with established safety and purity specifications.[^2][^3]

## Who should avoid Orange GGN?
- Consumers in the EU and U.S. will generally not encounter it in foods due to regulatory restrictions.[^1][^2]
- If you are purchasing foods in regions with different rules, check labels. People who prefer to avoid non-approved or uncertified dyes should steer clear of products listing “E111” or “Orange GGN.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E111 is the same as [Sunset Yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf){.additive}.”
  Fact: They are different colors with different regulatory status; Sunset Yellow FCF is specifically listed where permitted, while E111 is not.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “If a dye was used in the past, it’s still allowed.”
  Fact: Authorization can change over time as laws and safety reviews evolve. Only additives on current official lists may be used.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “Natural colors can’t replace synthetic oranges.”
  Fact: Natural options like [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive} or [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive} can provide orange shades in many foods, with specifications where authorized.[^3]

## Orange GGN in branded foods
In the EU and U.S., you should not find E111 on ingredient lists of branded foods because it is not authorized for use.[^1][^2] If you see it on products from other markets, that may reflect different local rules. Always follow your region’s regulations and labeling standards.
