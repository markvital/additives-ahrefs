Zinc acetate (E650) is a zinc salt of acetic acid. In food, it is mainly used as a source of zinc for fortification and may also help control acidity in certain formulas. It is approved in the European Union and is generally safe when intake stays within recommended limits.

## At a glance
- What it is: a mineral salt made from zinc and acetic acid; often found as the dihydrate crystal form.
- What it does: adds zinc to foods (fortification); can help stabilize acidity in some recipes.
- Where it shows up: fortified foods and beverages, and in some zinc lozenges or supplements (those are regulated separately from regular foods).
- Diets: not made from animal products; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.
- Label names: zinc acetate, E650.

## Why is Zinc acetate added to food?
Food makers use zinc acetate to add the essential mineral zinc to a product. This helps foods meet nutrition targets or support claims like “source of zinc.” In the EU, zinc acetate is an authorized form of zinc for use in both fortified foods and food supplements, meaning it can legally supply zinc in those products.[^2] It may also contribute mild acidity control in certain formulations.

## What foods contain Zinc acetate?
You are most likely to see zinc acetate in fortified products where zinc is intentionally added, such as some cereals, nutrition drinks, or meal replacements, particularly in the EU where it is an approved additive with set specifications.[^1] It also appears in zinc lozenges and supplements, although those are sold as dietary supplements or medicines rather than conventional foods.[^3]

On labels, look for “zinc acetate” or “E650.”

## What can replace Zinc acetate?
- To add zinc: manufacturers often use other permitted zinc sources such as zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, or zinc oxide (availability depends on local rules).
- For acidity or buffering: common alternatives include [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive}, [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}, or [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates){.additive}, depending on the recipe and taste.

## How is Zinc acetate made?
Industrially, zinc acetate is typically produced by neutralizing acetic acid with a zinc compound (such as zinc oxide or zinc carbonate), then crystallizing the product—often as the dihydrate.[^5] The EU specification lists zinc acetate as a defined additive with purity criteria for food use.[^1]

## Is Zinc acetate safe to eat?
In the EU, zinc acetate (E650) is an approved food additive and must meet compositional and purity specifications when used in foods.[^1] Safety depends on total zinc intake from all sources. In the United States, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults is 40 mg/day of zinc from food, water, and supplements combined.[^3] European scientific bodies have set a lower adult UL of 25 mg/day; national and regional limits can differ.[^6]

Very high intakes of zinc over time can cause nausea and can reduce copper status, leading to anemia or neurological issues, which is why staying within established intake limits matters.[^3]

## Does Zinc acetate have any benefits?
Zinc is an essential mineral. It helps the immune system work properly and supports wound healing, normal taste and smell, and DNA synthesis.[^4] Zinc acetate itself is not “special,” but it is one way to supply zinc in foods and supplements. Zinc lozenges often use zinc acetate; research on whether lozenges shorten colds is mixed, and they do not “cure” a cold.[^3]

## Who should avoid Zinc acetate?
- People already taking high-dose zinc supplements should be cautious; too much zinc can interfere with copper and iron status.[^3]
- Those taking certain antibiotics (like tetracyclines or quinolones) or penicillamine should separate dosing from zinc, which can reduce absorption of these medicines.[^3]
- Children and pregnant or breastfeeding people have lower ULs than healthy nonpregnant adults; consult a health professional before adding extra zinc.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- “All E‑numbers are artificial.” Not true. Many E‑numbers are minerals or simple organic compounds; zinc acetate is a mineral salt.
- “Zinc acetate makes food taste metallic.” At permitted levels in foods, taste impact is usually minimal; formulators choose the form and dose to avoid off-flavors.
- “Zinc lozenges cure colds.” Evidence is mixed; some studies suggest a shorter duration when taken early, but they do not cure colds.[^3]

## Zinc acetate in branded foods
Brand use varies by country and over time. To check, read the ingredient list for “zinc acetate” or “E650.” Fortified products are the most likely place to find it. Lozenges and many supplements also use zinc acetate, but those items are regulated differently from standard foods.[^3]
