Octyl gallate (E311) is an antioxidant used to help keep fats and oils from going rancid. It belongs to the “gallates” family, which includes propyl and dodecyl gallate, and is added in tiny amounts to stabilize flavor, color, and aroma in fatty foods.

## At a glance
This section gives a quick view of what E311 does and where you might see it.

- What it is: The octyl ester of gallic acid; a fat‑soluble antioxidant.
- What it does: Slows oxidation so oils, fats, and fat‑rich foods keep their taste and smell longer.
- Where it appears: Some fats and oils, spreads, and other foods that contain susceptible oils.
- Label names: “Octyl gallate,” “E311,” or “antioxidant: E311.”
- Similar additives: [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive} and [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate){.additive}; often paired with [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}.
- Dietary notes: Typically produced from non‑animal sources; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Why is Octyl gallate added to food?
Octyl gallate helps prevent “rancidity,” the off‑flavors and odors that form when oxygen reacts with fats and oils. By interrupting the chain reactions of lipid oxidation, it protects delicate flavors and extends shelf life. It can be used on its own or in blends with other antioxidants such as [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}, [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, or chelators like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} that help control trace metals.

## What foods contain Octyl gallate?
You’re most likely to find octyl gallate in foods that are rich in fats or oils and would otherwise spoil faster due to oxidation. Examples include certain vegetable oils and shortenings, spreads, and other processed foods where fat stability matters. In the European Union, E311 is an authorized antioxidant for specific food categories listed in Annex II of the food additives regulation, and its use is limited to those categories and set maximum levels.[^2]

## What can replace Octyl gallate?
Manufacturers choose from several antioxidants depending on the food, the flavor profile, and the rules in each country. Common alternatives include:
- Natural options: [tocopherols (vitamin E)](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive} and [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive}.
- Other approved antioxidants: [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}, [dodecyl gallate](/e312-dodecyl-gallate){.additive}, [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, and [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive}.
- Synergists often used alongside antioxidants: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}.

## How is Octyl gallate made?
Chemically, octyl gallate is the octyl ester of gallic acid, a tri‑hydroxybenzoic acid found in many plants.[^4] Food‑grade octyl gallate is produced by esterifying gallic acid with 1‑octanol, followed by purification to remove unreacted materials and meet food additive specifications.[^3] In the EU, identity and purity criteria for E311 are laid down in the additives specification regulation.[^1]

## Is Octyl gallate safe to eat?
In the EU, octyl gallate is an authorized food additive (E311). Its permitted uses and maximum levels are defined in law, and any E311 used in foods must meet strict identity and purity criteria.[^2][^1] International experts at the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) have evaluated gallates (propyl, octyl, and dodecyl) as a group and established a group acceptable daily intake (ADI), concluding they are safe when used within the established limits.[^3]

## Does Octyl gallate have any benefits?
For consumers, the main benefit is fresher‑tasting products for longer. By protecting oils and fats from oxidation, octyl gallate helps maintain flavor and aroma and can reduce food waste. For manufacturers, it offers fat‑soluble antioxidant performance that can complement other antioxidants in a blend.

## Who should avoid Octyl gallate?
- People who have been advised by their healthcare provider to avoid gallates, or who have previously reacted to gallates such as [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}, should avoid foods listing E311.
- As with any additive, those on medically restricted diets should check labels and follow professional advice.

## Myths & facts
- “Octyl gallate is a solvent or fuel additive.” Fact: Despite the “octyl” name, E311 is a food‑grade antioxidant and must meet food purity standards.[^1]
- “All E‑numbers are artificial and unsafe.” Fact: E‑numbers are simply codes for approved food additives in the EU; many are vitamins or plant‑derived substances, and all authorized additives have been risk‑assessed for their permitted uses.[^2]
- “Antioxidants only help the manufacturer.” Fact: They also help consumers by keeping food tasting as it should and by limiting waste due to rancidity.

## Octyl gallate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “octyl gallate,” “E311,” or “antioxidant (E311).” In some products it may appear together with [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} as part of an antioxidant system designed to protect fats and oils.
