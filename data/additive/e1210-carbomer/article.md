Carbomer (E1210) is a synthetic, cross‑linked polymer of acrylic acid used to thicken and stabilize water-based foods and supplements. It swells in water to form smooth gels, helping keep particles evenly suspended and giving products a consistent texture. You’ll encounter it in very small amounts, typically in specialized products rather than everyday foods.

## At a glance
- E-number: E1210; name on labels: carbomer
- What it does: thickens, stabilizes, and forms gels in water
- Where it’s used: mainly specialized products such as food supplements and certain flavor systems
- Origin: fully synthetic (cross‑linked polyacrylic acid)

## Why is Carbomer added to food?
Carbomer is added because a tiny amount can turn water into a smooth, stable gel. That gel helps suspend particles, keep flavors or sweeteners evenly mixed, and prevent separation during shelf life. It also gives a controlled, “spoonable” texture that is easy to pour or squeeze.

## What foods contain Carbomer?
In the European Union, authorized uses and maximum levels for E1210 are set in the Union list of food additives; you can look up current permitted categories in the Commission’s public database.[^3][^4] In practice, carbomer appears mostly in specialized products such as food supplements (for example, syrups or gels) and certain flavor or aroma preparations where a clear, stable gel or suspension is needed.

## What can replace Carbomer?
Several hydrocolloids can provide similar thickening or stabilizing effects, depending on the recipe:
- [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for robust, pourable viscosity
- [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum) for firm, heat-stable gels
- [agar](/e406-agar) for brittle, high‑set gels
- [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) for cold‑process thickening
- [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) for dairy-friendly gelling
- [pectins](/e440-pectins) for fruit-based gels and jams
- [sodium carboxy‑methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose) for stabilizing and body

Formulators often blend hydrocolloids to fine‑tune mouthfeel and stability.

## How is Carbomer made?
Carbomer is a high‑molecular‑weight polymer produced by polymerizing acrylic acid and then cross‑linking the chains with multifunctional compounds (commonly allyl ethers of pentaerythritol, propylene glycol, or sucrose). The result is a three‑dimensional network that swells strongly in water and thickens when the pH is adjusted neutral-to-slightly-alkaline.[^1]

## Is Carbomer safe to eat?
In the EU, a food additive can be marketed only if it is authorized in the Union list after a safety assessment and risk management decision. For E1210, detailed identity and purity specifications are set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which also limits certain residual substances from manufacturing.[^2][^1] Authorized food categories and any maximum use levels are established in the Union list under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and its amendments.[^2][^4]

## Does Carbomer have any benefits?
- Processing benefits: strong thickening at low doses, stable suspensions, and clear gels.
- Label clarity: lists simply as “carbomer” or “E1210.”
- No nutritional effect: it does not add calories or vitamins; its role is purely technological.

## Who should avoid Carbomer?
There is no general consumer group that must avoid E1210 when it is used within authorized conditions. However, EU law sets special rules for foods for infants and young children—additives are restricted in those products unless specifically permitted, so always check labels in those categories.[^2] If a healthcare professional has advised you to limit certain additives, follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Carbomer is the same as urea (carbamide).” Fact: They are different substances; carbomer is a cross‑linked polyacrylic acid polymer.
- Myth: “It’s absorbed like small chemicals.” Fact: Carbomer is a very large polymer designed to swell in water; specifications focus on polymer identity and purity, not systemic nutrition.[^1]
- Myth: “If it’s synthetic, it must be unsafe.” Fact: In the EU, both natural and synthetic additives require authorization and specifications before use in food.[^2]

## Carbomer in branded foods
On labels, look for “carbomer” or “E1210.” You’re most likely to see it in gel‑type food supplements, some syrups, and occasionally in flavor or aroma systems that need clear, stable viscosity. Everyday staple foods seldom use carbomer because other gums may be better suited to those recipes.
