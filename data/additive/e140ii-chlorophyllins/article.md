Chlorophyllins (E140II) are water‑soluble green colorings made by modifying chlorophyll from plants like spinach or alfalfa. They give a bright, stable green shade in drinks, sweets, and other foods where natural chlorophyll would fade or brown.

## At a glance
- What it is: water‑soluble salts derived from plant chlorophyll, often called sodium or potassium chlorophyllin.
- What it does: colors foods a vivid, leaf‑green; more stable than natural chlorophyll in acidic or heat‑treated foods.
- Common uses: soft drinks, confectionery, ice cream, desserts, sauces, and processed vegetables.
- How it appears on labels: “E140ii,” “E140,” or “chlorophyllins.”
- Dietary notes: plant‑derived; not known as a common allergen.
- Related colors: natural [chlorophylls](/e140i-chlorophylls) and copper complexes of chlorophylls/chlorophyllins ([E141](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins)).

## Why is Chlorophyllins added to food?
Food makers use chlorophyllins because they provide a clean, stable green color in water‑based foods, especially under acidic conditions where natural chlorophyll would degrade and turn olive‑brown. They are authorized in the EU as color additives and are favored when a plant‑based green is desired with better solubility and processing stability than native chlorophyll.[^1]

## What foods contain Chlorophyllins?
Chlorophyllins can appear in many categories that permit color additives, including flavored beverages, ice creams and sorbets, candies and chewing gum, cake decorations and fillings, sauces, and certain processed vegetables. Exact permissions and maximum levels depend on the food category set in EU rules.[^3] EFSA’s re‑evaluation considered typical uses across these categories when assessing exposure.[^1]

## What can replace Chlorophyllins?
- Other natural greens: [chlorophylls](/e140i-chlorophylls) for oil‑based or less acidic foods.
- Stabilized greens: [copper complexes of chlorophyllins](/e141ii-copper-complexes-of-chlorophyllins) or [copper complexes of chlorophylls](/e141i-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls) for extra stability.
- Different natural hues: yellow/orange from [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) or [lutein](/e161b-lutein), red/purple from [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins).
- Blends with synthetics where allowed: green can be made by mixing [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) and [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf).

## How is Chlorophyllins made?
Chlorophyllins are produced by extracting chlorophyll from edible plant material, then saponifying it under alkaline conditions to remove the phytol tail and methyl groups, and replacing the central magnesium with hydrogen. The resulting acids are neutralized to form water‑soluble sodium, potassium, or ammonium salts—these are the chlorophyllins sold as E140II.[^2]

## Is Chlorophyllins safe to eat?
EFSA re‑evaluated chlorophyllins (E140II) and found no safety concern at the levels used in foods, based on available toxicity, genotoxicity, and exposure data.[^1] In the EU, their use is limited by category‑specific rules and purity specifications that help control contaminants and composition.[^3]

## Does Chlorophyllins have any benefits?
Benefits are mainly technical: a vibrant green shade that holds up better in water‑based, acidic, or heat‑treated foods compared with native chlorophyll. Chlorophyllins are not added for nutrition or health effects.

## Who should avoid Chlorophyllins?
- Anyone avoiding color additives altogether.
- People following very strict ingredient lists (for example, during elimination diets) who prefer uncolored products.
- If you think you have a sensitivity to a specific color, discuss it with a healthcare professional; confirmed reactions to chlorophyllins are rare.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Chlorophyllin is just chlorophyll.” Fact: Chlorophyllins are modified, water‑soluble salts made from chlorophyll and do not contain its natural magnesium ion.[^2]
- Myth: “All green food colors have copper.” Fact: E140II chlorophyllins are copper‑free; copper‑containing greens are listed separately as E141.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s a synthetic dye.” Fact: E140II is derived from plant chlorophyll, processed to improve water solubility and stability.[^2]

## Chlorophyllins in branded foods
You’ll most often see chlorophyllins in bright green beverages, mints and other green candies, pistachio or mint ice creams, cake decorations, and green sauces. On ingredient lists, look for “E140ii,” “E140,” “chlorophyllin,” or “chlorophyllins.”
