Calcium fumarate (E367) is the calcium salt of fumaric acid, a tart-tasting organic acid used to control acidity in foods. It helps adjust pH, stabilize flavor, and can add a very small amount of calcium to the recipe. Rules for its use vary by country and product type.

## At a glance
A quick overview helps put this additive in context before the details.

- Name and code: Calcium fumarate, E367
- What it does: Controls acidity and stabilizes flavor in foods
- Where you might see it: Select bakery items, powdered mixes, and other foods that use acid regulators
- Related additives: [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid){.additive}, [potassium fumarate](/e366-potassium-fumarate){.additive}, other common acidulants like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} and [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid){.additive}

## Why is calcium fumarate added to food?
Food makers use calcium fumarate to regulate acidity (pH), fine-tune tartness, and help maintain flavor stability over shelf life. As a calcium salt of fumaric acid, it provides the same “fumarate” ion while being less soluble than the free acid, which can make its acidifying effect more gradual in some applications.[^1] In the European Union, it is part of the E-number system as E367, which categorizes permitted food additives by function and identity.[^2] Specifications for additives in the EU are laid down in a separate regulation that defines identity and purity criteria.[^3]

## What foods contain calcium fumarate?
You may find calcium fumarate in foods that need acidity control or a mild tart note, such as certain baked goods or dry beverage mixes that are formulated to release acidity more slowly than the free acid. Exact permissions and maximum levels depend on the food category and local regulations; the EU Union List and the EU Food Additives Database provide the up-to-date status by product type.[^2][^5]

## What can replace calcium fumarate?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe, processing conditions, and desired taste profile.
- Direct acidulant: [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid){.additive} for a stronger, faster acidity effect
- Other fumarate salt: [potassium fumarate](/e366-potassium-fumarate){.additive}
- Other common acidulants: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid){.additive}, or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid){.additive}

## How is calcium fumarate made?
Manufacture typically starts with fumaric acid, which can be produced industrially by isomerizing maleic acid or by fermentation using certain fungi (for example, Rhizopus species).[^4] The fumaric acid is then neutralized with an approved calcium base (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) to form the calcium salt.

## Is calcium fumarate safe to eat?
International and regional authorities evaluate acidity regulators, including fumarates, for safety and set conditions of use where appropriate. Fumaric acid and its salts have been assessed by expert bodies, and their use is managed through regulations that specify where and how they may be used in foods.[^4][^5] In the EU, permitted uses and limits are established under the food additives framework and associated specifications.[^2][^3]

## Does calcium fumarate have any benefits?
- Functionality: It helps control a product’s acidity, which can influence taste, texture, and shelf life.
- Nutrition: Because usage levels are low, any added calcium is typically minor and products are not usually marketed as a calcium source.

## Who should avoid calcium fumarate?
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit calcium or certain acid regulators, check ingredient lists and choose products accordingly.
- People with specific dietary restrictions or allergies should always review labels, as formulations can change.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E-numbers are synthetic chemicals.”  
  Fact: E-numbers include both naturally occurring substances and synthetic ones; the system is a way to standardize names and oversight in the EU.[^2]
- Myth: “If it’s a salt, it can’t affect acidity.”  
  Fact: Acid salts like calcium fumarate can still regulate pH; their solubility and release profile just differ from the free acid.[^1]
- Myth: “Using a fumarate is completely different from using fumaric acid.”  
  Fact: They share the same fumarate ion; differences mostly relate to solubility, speed of acid release, and formulation needs.[^1]

## Calcium fumarate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, it may appear as “calcium fumarate” or “E367” in regions that use E-numbers.[^2] Placement on the list follows standard labeling rules for ingredients used in the recipe.
