Propylene glycol (E1520) is a clear, slightly syrupy liquid used in many foods. It helps keep foods moist and evenly mixed, especially for flavors and colors, and it is approved by major safety agencies when used properly. Most people consume only small amounts from a mix of processed foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: a small organic molecule (also called propane-1,2-diol) used as a humectant and solvent
- What it does: keeps foods from drying out and dissolves flavors, colors, and some vitamins
- Where it’s found: flavor concentrates, frostings, baked goods, seasonings, soft drinks, and ice creams
- Safety: affirmed as safe in the U.S. when used under good manufacturing practice; the EU sets an acceptable daily intake
- On the label: propylene glycol, E1520, propane-1,2-diol, or propan-1,2-diol

## Why is Propylene Glycol added to food?
Food makers use propylene glycol to do two big jobs: hold moisture (humectant) and dissolve ingredients that don’t mix well with water, such as some flavors, colors, and extracts (solvent and carrier). This helps flavors spread evenly, keeps textures soft, and prevents sugar from crystallizing in sweets and icings.[^2] In the EU, it is authorized as a food additive (E1520) and evaluated for safety with a defined acceptable daily intake.[^1]

## What foods contain Propylene Glycol?
You’ll most often see propylene glycol in:
- Flavor concentrates and liquid colors used to make beverages, candies, and baked goods
- Frostings, glazes, and fillings that need to stay smooth and moist
- Seasoning blends, spice pastes, and sauces
- Ice creams, frozen desserts, and dairy drinks where it helps keep texture uniform
- Some low-moisture snacks and bars to prevent drying

It may be used directly in the food or in the added flavor or color system, at levels needed to do the job under good manufacturing practice.[^2]

## What can replace Propylene Glycol?
Alternatives depend on why it’s used:
- For moisture retention: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol)
- For dissolving flavors or extracts: [ethanol](/e1510-ethanol), [glyceryl triacetate](/e1518-glyceryl-triacetate)
- For stabilizing emulsions or texture (when PG is acting as a co-solvent in an emulsion): [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- For specific applications in sauces and dressings: [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate) (a polysorbate emulsifier)
- Note: “Propylene glycol alginate” is a different additive used mainly as a thickener and stabilizer; see [propane-1,2-diol alginate](/e405-propane-1-2-diol-alginate)

## How is Propylene Glycol made?
Most commercial propylene glycol is produced by reacting propylene oxide with water (hydration), followed by purification. This yields a high-purity, food-grade product that is colorless, nearly odorless, and slightly sweet.[^3] In the EU, purity criteria (such as limits for impurities and identification tests) are laid out in the additive specifications.[^4]

## Is Propylene Glycol safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed propylene glycol many times. In the EU, the scientific panel set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, based on toxicity studies showing no concerns for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity at typical exposures.[^1] In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms propylene glycol as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for direct use in food at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^2]

Like many food ingredients, very high intakes may cause issues such as stomach upset or, in extreme cases, metabolic stress—especially in people with certain medical conditions. These situations are uncommon from food alone and are more often linked to high exposures from medicines or other products.[^3]

## Does Propylene Glycol have any benefits?
For food makers and eaters, propylene glycol offers practical benefits:
- Keeps baked goods, frostings, and fillings moist for longer
- Helps flavors taste uniform from first bite to last by dissolving and carrying them evenly
- Reduces sugar crystallization in sweets and helps keep frozen desserts creamy
- Works well with both water-loving and oil-loving ingredients, bridging the gap as a co-solvent

## Who should avoid Propylene Glycol?
Most healthy adults can consume products with propylene glycol in normal amounts without problems. However:
- People with known sensitivity to propylene glycol should avoid it
- Infants and young children clear propylene glycol more slowly; medicines for children have special cautions, and caregivers may wish to limit combined exposure from foods and drugs[^6]
- People with significant kidney or liver disease may also be more sensitive and should follow medical advice[^3]

If you have concerns, check labels for “propylene glycol,” “E1520,” “propane-1,2-diol,” or “propan-1,2-diol.”

## Myths & facts
- “Propylene glycol is the same as antifreeze.” False. The toxic antifreeze people worry about is ethylene glycol. Propylene glycol is a different, much less toxic chemical; in fact, it is used in some “low-toxicity” antifreeze blends.[^5]
- “Propylene glycol is always an emulsifier.” Not exactly. It mainly acts as a humectant and solvent. It can help emulsions indirectly as a co-solvent, but it is not a classic emulsifier like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or polysorbates.
- “It’s unsafe in all amounts.” No. Safety reviews set limits and conditions. The EU set an ADI, and the U.S. allows it under good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## Propylene Glycol in branded foods
You can find propylene glycol on labels of:
- Flavored beverages and syrups
- Frostings, glazes, and ready-to-spread icings
- Packaged cakes, donuts, and pastries
- Seasoning pastes, spice blends, and sauces
- Ice creams and frozen treats

Label names may include propylene glycol, E1520, propane-1,2-diol, or propan-1,2-diol. If an ingredient list names a flavor or color “in propylene glycol,” that counts too.
