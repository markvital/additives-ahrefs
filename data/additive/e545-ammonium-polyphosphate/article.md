Ammonium polyphosphate (E545) is a phosphate-based food additive used for technical roles like regulating acidity and binding metal ions. It belongs to the broader phosphate group used to stabilize texture, maintain clarity, and help foods keep their quality during shelf life. <!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: The ammonium salt of polyphosphoric acid; a member of the phosphate additive family.
- E-number: E545
- Main roles: Acidity regulator, stabilizer, and sequestrant (binds metal ions that can cause haze or off-flavors).
- Where it’s allowed: Authorized in the European Union with detailed conditions of use.
- How it appears on labels: “Ammonium polyphosphate” or “E545”.
- Related additives: Other phosphates like [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive}, [sodium polyphosphate](/e452i-sodium-polyphosphate){.additive}, and [calcium polyphosphate](/e544-calcium-polyphosphate){.additive}.

## Why is Ammonium polyphosphate added to food?
Food makers use ammonium polyphosphate for its phosphate functions. These include regulating acidity, stabilizing proteins and emulsions, and acting as a sequestrant that binds trace metals to prevent haze, discoloration, or off-flavors in foods and drinks.[^1]

## What foods contain Ammonium polyphosphate?
In the European Union, which foods may contain E545 is set out in Annex II of the food additives law. The exact categories and maximum levels depend on the product type and are listed in the legal text and its updates.[^3] If present, the additive must be declared in the ingredient list by its functional class plus name or E-number, so you can look for “ammonium polyphosphate” or “E545” on the label.[^4]

## What can replace Ammonium polyphosphate?
Possible alternatives depend on the job it is doing in the recipe:
- For acidity control: [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}
- For sequestration or stabilization: [sodium polyphosphate](/e452i-sodium-polyphosphate){.additive}, [potassium phosphates](/e340-potassium-phosphates){.additive}, [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates){.additive}, or the group [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates){.additive}
- For texture/emulsion support in some systems: other permitted phosphates chosen to match the process and pH

Formulators select a replacement based on pH, mineral content, and the food matrix, and must follow the permitted uses set in law.[^3]

## How is Ammonium polyphosphate made?
Food-grade ammonium polyphosphate is produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid with ammonia and then heating (condensing) the salt so that phosphate units link into longer chains, forming a mixture of polyphosphate chain lengths.[^2]

## Is Ammonium polyphosphate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated phosphate additives, including E545, and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus.[^1] EFSA also noted that total dietary exposure to phosphates can be high in some population groups and should be managed within the legal limits for each food category.[^1][^3]

## Does Ammonium polyphosphate have any benefits?
Yes—its benefits are technological, not nutritional. By regulating acidity and binding trace metals, it helps foods and beverages keep their intended texture, color, and flavor during processing and storage.[^1] In certain recipes, it can also help proteins and emulsions remain stable over time.[^1]

## Who should avoid Ammonium polyphosphate?
People who must limit phosphorus intake—such as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD)—are often advised to reduce foods high in phosphate additives and to read labels carefully.[^5] If you have a medical reason to limit phosphorus, ask your healthcare professional or dietitian about phosphate additives like E545.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Ammonium polyphosphate adds ammonia gas to food.”
  - Fact: It is a stable salt. It does not act like ammonia gas; in food it functions as a phosphate additive under strict purity and use rules.[^2]
- Myth: “All phosphates are the same.”
  - Fact: There are many phosphate additives with different cations (sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium) and chain lengths. They are approved for specific roles and foods.[^3]
- Myth: “If it’s approved, I don’t need to check my intake.”
  - Fact: EFSA set an ADI for total phosphate intake, and some people may approach or exceed it, depending on diet. Label reading helps manage overall intake.[^1][^4]

## Ammonium polyphosphate in branded foods
Ingredient lists in the EU must show additives by category plus name or E-number, so look for “acidity regulator: ammonium polyphosphate (E545)” or similar wording.[^4] Availability and use vary by product type and country; checking the label is the most reliable way to know if a specific brand contains E545.
