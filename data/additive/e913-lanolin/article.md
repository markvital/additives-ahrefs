Lanolin (E913) is a waxy material derived from sheep’s wool. In food, it is used mainly to give a glossy finish to surfaces and to soften chewing gum bases. Regulatory bodies in the EU and United States allow its use under specific conditions.

## At a glance
- What it is: a refined wax from sheep’s wool (also called wool wax or wool grease)
- Main role: glazing/coating agent and softener in chewing gum base
- Typical presence: surface-coated fruits and some confectionery; chewing gum
- Not vegan or vegetarian: animal-derived
- Regulated use: permitted in the EU and US within set specifications

## Why is lanolin added to food?
Lanolin is added for its technological effects, not for flavor. As a glazing agent, it creates a smooth, shiny coating that can protect delicate surfaces from moisture loss and handling scuffs. EU specifications list lanolin (E913) as a food additive with glazing function, defining its identity and purity so it performs consistently in these roles.[^1]

## What foods contain lanolin?
Lanolin shows up in a small set of foods:
- Surface-treated produce and confectionery: In the EU, lanolin is authorized as a glazing agent for surface treatments in specific categories listed in the food additives regulation.[^2]
- Chewing gum: In the United States, lanolin is an allowed component of chewing gum base, where it acts as a softener/plasticizer to improve texture and chew.[^3]

Because it is used on surfaces or within gum base, the actual amounts present are very small.

## What can replace lanolin?
Manufacturers may choose other glazing agents or gum-base softeners depending on the application:
- Other common glazes: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive}, [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive}, [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}, [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}, [rice bran wax](/e908-rice-bran-wax){.additive}, or [oxidised polyethylene wax](/e914-oxidised-polyethylene-wax){.additive}
- Alternative softeners/waxes in gum bases: options can include [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax){.additive} and related waxes, depending on regional rules and desired texture

## How is lanolin made?
Lanolin is obtained by washing (scouring) shorn sheep’s wool to separate the natural wool grease. This material is then refined and purified to meet food-grade specifications, which set limits on composition and potential contaminants. The EU’s additive specification describes lanolin as a purified wool wax with defined identity and purity criteria.[^1]

## Is lanolin safe to eat?
When used as authorized, lanolin is considered safe by major regulators. It is permitted as a food additive in the EU with strict specifications, including impurity limits that cover potential contaminants such as pesticide residues originating from wool processing.[^1] International food standards also list lanolin (INS 913) as a glazing agent for specified uses in foods, reinforcing its accepted safety at regulated levels.[^4]

## Does lanolin have any benefits?
Lanolin’s benefits are technological:
- It adds gloss and helps protect the surface of foods like coated fruits or confectionery.
- In chewing gum base, it improves texture and chew by acting as a softener.

Lanolin is also the starting material for most supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) used to fortify foods and supplements, though the vitamin itself is added as a nutrient, not as E913.[^5]

## Who should avoid lanolin?
- Vegans and many vegetarians: Lanolin is animal-derived.
- People with known lanolin sensitivity: While reactions are most often related to skin contact in cosmetics, individuals with a diagnosed lanolin allergy may prefer to avoid ingesting it.
- Those following specific religious or dietary rules may also choose to avoid animal-derived additives.

## Myths & facts
- “Lanolin in food means there’s wool in it.” Fact: Lanolin is a refined wax separated from wool; no fibers are present.
- “Lanolin changes the taste.” Fact: It’s used at very low levels for surface shine or as part of gum base, not for flavor.
- “Lanolin is the same as petroleum wax.” Fact: Lanolin is animal-derived; petroleum waxes are mineral-derived and regulated separately.

## Lanolin in branded foods
You’re most likely to find lanolin:
- On surface-coated fruits or confectionery in regions where it’s authorized
- In chewing gum (as part of the gum base in the US)

Look for “E913,” “lanolin,” “wool wax,” or “glazing agent” on ingredient lists. For fresh produce, coatings may be listed on signs or pack labels rather than on each piece of fruit.
