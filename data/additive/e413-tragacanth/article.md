Tragacanth (E413) is a natural gum collected from certain Astragalus shrubs. It’s used in tiny amounts to thicken, stabilize, and emulsify foods without changing their taste or color.<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: A plant-based gum from Astragalus shrubs; a hydrocolloid that swells in water to give body and stability
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier in sauces, dressings, sweets, and more
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU as E413 and considered GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) in the U.S. when used under good manufacturing practice[^3][^2]
- Diets: Plant-derived and typically used in very small amounts

## Why is Tragacanth added to food?
Manufacturers add tragacanth to control texture and stability. It helps suspend particles, prevent separation in emulsions, and add body to liquids and semi-solids. In regulations, its functions are listed as thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier.[^3][^2]

## What foods contain Tragacanth?
You may find E413 in a variety of products, for example:
- Salad dressings and sauces that need stable thickness
- Confectionery (such as pastilles and decorations) that benefit from firming and shape retention
- Bakery fillings and icings where smooth, stable texture is important
- Some dairy and non-dairy desserts where it helps limit ice crystals and separation

On ingredient lists it can appear as “tragacanth,” “tragacanth gum,” or “E413.”

## What can replace Tragacanth?
Other hydrocolloids can play similar roles, depending on the recipe:
- [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for strong thickening and suspension
- [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) for cold viscosity in beverages and dairy
- [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum) for creamy, elastic textures (often paired with other gums)
- [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) for gel-strength and stabilization in dairy
- [pectins](/e440-pectins) for fruit-based gels and glazes
- [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) for emulsification in beverages
- [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate) for heat-stable thickening and gelation with calcium

The best substitute depends on pH, temperature, salt, sugar, and the desired mouthfeel.

## How is Tragacanth made?
Tragacanth is obtained by making small cuts in the stems or branches of Astragalus species shrubs. The sap exudes, dries into ribbons or flakes, and is then collected. The dried gum is cleaned, sorted, and milled into powder for food use, following purity specifications set in the EU for E-numbered additives.[^3]

## Is Tragacanth safe to eat?
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists gum tragacanth as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] Its GRAS status is also codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.[^2]
- European Union: Tragacanth is authorized as a food additive (E413) with identity and purity requirements defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3]

These frameworks allow its use at levels needed to achieve the intended technical effect in foods.[^2]

## Does Tragacanth have any benefits?
For food makers and cooks, tragacanth:
- Thickens without adding significant taste or color
- Stabilizes emulsions and suspensions, helping prevent separation
- Works in acidic systems and over a range of processing conditions

It is used in very small amounts to fine-tune texture and stability.

## Who should avoid Tragacanth?
- Anyone with a known allergy or sensitivity to tragacanth or similar gums should avoid it.
- If a healthcare professional has advised you to limit certain food additives or dietary fiber-like ingredients, follow that guidance.
- For infants and people with specific medical conditions, seek personalized advice before using foods thickened with gums.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are always synthetic.” Fact: Tragacanth (E413) is a plant-derived gum from Astragalus shrubs.
- Myth: “All gums work the same.” Fact: Each hydrocolloid behaves differently; tragacanth is valued for stable viscosity and suspension, especially in acidic systems.
- Myth: “If a label lists E413, the product is highly processed.” Fact: E-numbers are simply standardized identifiers for approved additives in the EU.

## Tragacanth in branded foods
You’ll typically see it listed as “tragacanth,” “tragacanth gum,” or “E413” on ingredient labels. In some regions, only the name appears; in others, the E-number is shown as well. Presence and position in the list reflect how much is used, but amounts are usually very small because the gum is effective at low concentrations.
