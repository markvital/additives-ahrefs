      "q": "is dipotassium phosphate bad for you",
      "a": "Not for most people at the small amounts used in foods; E340(ii) is an approved additive. Those with kidney disease or on phosphate- or potassium‑restricted diets should limit it, as high phosphate or potassium intakes can be problematic.",

      "q": "is dipotassium phosphate safe",

      "q": "is dipotassium phosphate good for you",
      "a": "It’s mainly a processing aid, not a health booster; it contributes small amounts of potassium and phosphate but isn’t intended as a nutrient source. Any mineral supplementation should be guided by a healthcare professional.",
