Sodium aluminium silicate (E554) is a mineral-based anti-caking agent that helps powders stay dry and free-flowing. It is used in small amounts in foods like powdered mixes, spices, and grated cheese to stop clumps from forming and to keep products easy to pour. It is also known as sodium aluminosilicate or sodium silicoaluminate.

## At a glance
- What it is: An insoluble mineral (a type of aluminosilicate) used mainly as an anti-caking agent.
- What it does: Absorbs moisture and reduces clumping so powders flow and mix evenly.
- Common foods: Spice blends, powdered drink mixes, instant soups, baking mixes, grated hard cheeses, powdered sugar.
- Other names: E554, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium silicoaluminate.
- Regulation: Authorized in the EU with specific purity specs; considered GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for anticaking use in the U.S. when used as intended.[^1][^3]

## Why is Sodium aluminium silicate added to food?
Manufacturers add E554 to keep powders from sticking together. As an anti-caking agent, it soaks up trace moisture and reduces friction between particles, so products pour, dose, and blend consistently. This helps prevent hard lumps and improves shelf life and quality over time.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium aluminium silicate?
You’re most likely to find E554 in dry, powdered, or grated products where clumping is a risk. Examples include:
- Spice and herb blends, seasoning packets, and rubs
- Powdered drink mixes and instant coffee or tea products
- Baking mixes and instant dessert mixes
- Grated hard cheeses
- Powdered sugar and icing mixes
- Dry soup bases, bouillon, and sauce mixes
- Salt substitutes and some table salts (varies by brand and region)

Label wording may say “sodium aluminosilicate,” “sodium aluminium silicate,” “E554,” or “anti-caking agent.”

## What can replace Sodium aluminium silicate?
Other anti-caking agents that are often used instead include:
- [Silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide)
- [Calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate)
- [Talc (magnesium silicate)](/e553b-talc)
- [Tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate) or other [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates)
- In salt products, agents like [sodium ferrocyanide](/e535-sodium-ferrocyanide) are sometimes used
- For grated cheeses and sugars, non-additive options like starches are also common

The best substitute depends on the food, processing needs, and local rules.

## How is Sodium aluminium silicate made?
Food-grade E554 can be produced by reacting sodium silicate and sodium aluminate solutions to form a porous aluminosilicate, which is then washed, dried, and milled. It may also be derived from certain natural aluminosilicate minerals, provided it meets food specifications. In the EU, specifications define identity and purity ranges (for example, limits for sodium oxide, aluminium oxide, and silica), ensuring it is an insoluble, high-surface-area powder suitable for food use.[^2]

## Is Sodium aluminium silicate safe to eat?
- European Union: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) re-evaluated the “aluminium‑containing silicates” group (E554–E559). Based on their very low solubility and low oral absorption, EFSA did not identify safety concerns at the reported use levels for these anticaking agents.[^1]
- United States: FDA lists sodium aluminosilicate as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) as an anti-caking agent when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

Overall dietary aluminium exposure is managed by limiting how much aluminium migrates from additives and by controlling use levels in foods. For E554, its insoluble nature and low absorption mean it contributes little to systemic aluminium exposure compared with other sources.[^1]

## Does Sodium aluminium silicate have any benefits?
- Prevents clumping, making powders easy to pour and measure
- Helps powders dissolve or mix more uniformly in recipes
- Supports stable product texture and quality during storage
- Reduces waste and improves dosing in manufacturing

These functional benefits often let producers use less moisture or fewer packaging interventions to keep foods free-flowing.

## Who should avoid Sodium aluminium silicate?
Most people do not need to avoid E554. However:
- Individuals with severe kidney disease may be advised to limit total aluminium exposure because their bodies remove aluminium less efficiently; they should follow medical guidance and read labels.[^4]
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to follow a very low‑aluminium diet, discuss whether to limit foods with aluminium‑containing additives, including E554.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E554 is like eating aluminium foil.”  
  Fact: Sodium aluminium silicate is an insoluble mineral matrix; aluminium in this form is poorly absorbed from the gut.[^1]
- Myth: “Everyday aluminium exposures like food additives cause Alzheimer’s disease.”  
  Fact: Current evidence does not support a causal link between typical environmental aluminium exposure and Alzheimer’s disease.[^5]
- Myth: “Anti-caking agents are just fillers.”  
  Fact: E554 is used in very small amounts to manage moisture and flow; it is not added for bulk or calories.

## Sodium aluminium silicate in branded foods
You can spot E554 on ingredient lists of many dry, free‑flowing foods. Look for “sodium aluminosilicate,” “sodium aluminium silicate,” or “E554.” Product types that commonly use it include spice blends, powdered drink mixes, instant soups and sauces, grated hard cheeses, and baking or dessert mixes. If you prefer to avoid it, choose products labeled without anti‑caking agents or those that use alternatives like [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) or [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate).
