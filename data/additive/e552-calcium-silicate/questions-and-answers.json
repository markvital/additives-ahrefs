      "q": "how to remove calcium silicate from pool",
      "a": "Calcium silicate scale is very hard and relatively acid‑resistant, so it’s typically removed by mechanical means (pumice/scale pads or bead blasting) after lowering pH and using a sequestering agent; an acid spot test that doesn’t fizz helps confirm it’s silicate, not carbonate. Prevent recurrence by keeping water balanced (pH/alkalinity/calcium) and using a sequestrant.",

      "q": "how to cut calcium silicate board",
      "a": "Score‑and‑snap works for thin sheets; thicker boards are cut with a circular saw using a carbide or diamond blade at a slow feed rate. Control dust with wet cutting or HEPA extraction and wear PPE (respirator, eye protection, gloves).",

      "q": "is calcium silicate bad for you",
      "a": "As a food additive (E552) used mainly as an anticaking agent, it’s considered safe at permitted levels (JECFA ADI “not specified”; FDA GRAS). The main concern is inhaling fine dust in occupational settings, which can irritate the respiratory tract.",

      "q": "is calcium silicate vegan",
      "a": "Yes—it's a mineral/synthetic ingredient with no animal-derived components, so E552 is generally suitable for vegans.",
