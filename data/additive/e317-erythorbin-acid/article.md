Erythorbin acid (E317) is an antioxidant used to protect food color and flavor. It is a close chemical cousin of vitamin C but does not act as a vitamin in the body. You may also see it called isoascorbic acid or erythorbic acid on labels.

## At a glance
- What it is: An antioxidant that slows browning and flavor changes.
- What it does: Helps keep cured meats pink and stable; protects foods from oxidation.
- Where it’s found: Processed meats, canned or cut fruits and vegetables, and some drinks.
- Safety: Evaluated by U.S. and EU authorities; considered safe at allowed levels.

## Why is Erythorbin acid added to food?
Food makers add erythorbin acid to slow oxidation. Oxidation causes browning, fading of color, and stale or rancid flavors. As an antioxidant, erythorbin acid helps keep products looking and tasting fresh longer.[^3]  
In cured meats, it also works with nitrite to speed curing and stabilize the pink color. U.S. rules require an ascorbate-type substance (ascorbic or erythorbic/erythorbin) when nitrite is used in pumped bacon to help limit nitrosamine formation during cooking.[^2]

## What foods contain Erythorbin acid?
You may find it in:
- Cured and processed meats such as ham, hot dogs, and bacon (often with [sodium nitrite](/e250-sodium-nitrite)).[^2]
- Cut or canned fruits and vegetables to control browning.
- Beverages and syrups where color and flavor stability matter.

In meat and poultry, its use and maximum levels are set by U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations.[^2]

## What can replace Erythorbin acid?
Depending on the food, common alternatives include:
- [Ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) for similar antioxidant and curing effects.
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for acidification and some antioxidant support in fruits.
- Other antioxidants such as [tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq) or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary) for fats and oils.
- Preservatives like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) when microbial control is the main need.

## How is Erythorbin acid made?
Erythorbin acid is a stereochemical cousin (isomer) of vitamin C. It is typically produced from simple sugars (such as glucose) using fermentation and conversion steps, followed by purification to food grade.[^4] Its identity and common synonyms include isoascorbic acid and D-isoascorbic acid.[^5]

## Is Erythorbin acid safe to eat?
Major regulators have assessed this antioxidant. In the EU, erythorbic/erythorbin acid and its sodium salt were re-evaluated and considered of no safety concern at reported uses and use levels.[^3] International experts (JECFA) assigned an “ADI not specified,” indicating low toxicity at typical use levels.[^4] In the U.S., FDA lists erythorbic acid among permitted food ingredients and antioxidants.[^1]

## Does Erythorbin acid have any benefits?
- For food quality: It helps keep cured meats pink, slows browning in fruits and vegetables, and protects flavors in many products.[^3]
- For safety in cured meats: When used with nitrite, it helps limit the formation of nitrosamines during high-heat cooking; U.S. rules mandate an ascorbate-type compound in pumped bacon for this reason.[^2]  
- For nutrition: It is not vitamin C and does not provide vitamin C activity in humans.[^3]

## Who should avoid Erythorbin acid?
Most people do not need to avoid it. If you are under medical advice to limit certain additives, are following a nitrite-free diet, or have specific dietary restrictions related to processed meats, check labels and consult your healthcare provider. People sensitive to a particular product should consider the food as a whole, not just this ingredient.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as vitamin C.”  
  Fact: It is an isomer of vitamin C but does not act as a vitamin in the body.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s only in meat.”  
  Fact: It is common in meats, but it’s also used in fruits, vegetables, and some drinks to prevent browning and flavor loss.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s banned.”  
  Fact: It is permitted by U.S. and EU authorities within set rules and levels.[^1][^3]

## Erythorbin acid in branded foods
On labels, look for “erythorbin acid,” “erythorbic acid,” or “isoascorbic acid.” In meat products, you might also see the related salt “sodium erythorbate.” In multi-ingredient foods, it often appears alongside curing agents like [sodium nitrite](/e250-sodium-nitrite) or antioxidants such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid).
