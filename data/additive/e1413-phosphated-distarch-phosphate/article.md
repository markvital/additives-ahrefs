Phosphated distarch phosphate (E1413) is a modified starch used to thicken, stabilize, and help emulsify foods. It holds sauces and fillings together under heat, shear, and freezing, keeping textures smooth and preventing separation. It is approved in both the EU and the U.S. and is metabolized much like ordinary starch.

## At a glance
- What it is: A dual‑modified starch with phosphate cross‑links for extra stability
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier for smooth, stable textures
- Where you’ll see it: Soups, sauces, pie fillings, dairy desserts, ready meals, and frozen foods
- Label names: “E1413” or “phosphated distarch phosphate”; sometimes just “modified starch”
- Dietary notes: Plant‑based ingredient; source starch (corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat) varies by manufacturer
- Why it’s used: Improves heat, shear, and freeze–thaw stability compared with native starch
- Regulatory status: Authorized in the EU and permitted in the U.S. as a type of “food starch‑modified”[^1][^4]

## Why is Phosphated distarch phosphate added to food?
Manufacturers add E1413 to keep foods thick, smooth, and stable under tough processing and storage conditions. It helps:
- Resist breakdown during heating, mixing, and pumping
- Prevent watery separation (syneresis) in sauces, fillings, and gels
- Withstand freeze–thaw cycles in frozen meals and desserts
- Stabilize emulsions so oil and water stay mixed

Compared with native starch, E1413 holds its structure better, so foods keep the desired texture from factory to table.[^2]

## What foods contain Phosphated distarch phosphate?
You may find E1413 in:
- Canned and ambient sauces, gravies, and soups
- Pie fillings, fruit preparations, and jams
- Ready meals, including frozen entrées and sides
- Dairy desserts and yogurts
- Noodles and gluten‑free bakery items
- Dressings and dips that need emulsion stability

On labels, it can appear as “phosphated distarch phosphate,” “E1413,” or sometimes collectively as “modified starch.”

## What can replace Phosphated distarch phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and processing:
- Other modified starches for similar processing tolerance:
  - [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate)
  - [acetylated distarch phosphate](/e1414-distarch-phosphate)
  - [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate)
- Hydrocolloids for strong thickening or gel structure:
  - [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
  - [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
  - [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
  - [pectins](/e440-pectins)
  - [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate)
- Emulsifier help in creamy systems:
  - [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)

Choice depends on desired texture, clarity, process (hot-fill vs. retort vs. freeze–thaw), and label goals.

## How is Phosphated distarch phosphate made?
E1413 is produced by reacting food‑grade starch with phosphate‑based reagents to add both phosphate “monoester” groups and a small number of phosphate cross‑links between starch chains. Typical approved reagents include phosphorus oxychloride or sodium trimetaphosphate/tripolyphosphate, used under controlled alkaline conditions, followed by neutralisation, washing, and drying to remove residual reagents and salts.[^1][^2]

These chemical modifications strengthen the granule or paste network so the starch resists heat, shear, and freeze–thaw damage.

## Is Phosphated distarch phosphate safe to eat?
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration permits “food starch‑modified,” including phosphate‑treated starches like phosphated distarch phosphate, when made with specified reagents and good manufacturing practice.[^1]
- European Union: E1413 is an authorised food additive with official identity and purity specifications laid down in EU law.[^2][^4]
- Toxicology: International expert committees have evaluated modified starches and found low toxicity; they are handled by the body much like native starch. A numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary for the group of modified starches due to their safety profile at typical use levels.[^3]

## Does Phosphated distarch phosphate have any benefits?
For food quality, E1413 helps:
- Keep sauces and fillings stable in the can, pouch, or freezer
- Reduce syneresis and maintain a creamy mouthfeel
- Enable lower‑fat or lower‑oil recipes by building viscosity

For nutrition, modified starches are digested similarly to regular starch and mainly provide carbohydrate energy.[^3]

## Who should avoid Phosphated distarch phosphate?
- If you have specific allergies or intolerances to the source starch (for example, wheat), check the ingredient list or contact the manufacturer about the starch origin.
- People advised by a healthcare professional to limit certain additives or phosphorus from additives should review labels and discuss suitable products with their clinician.
- As with any carbohydrate thickener, individuals on physician‑directed carbohydrate‑restricted diets should consider total carbohydrate from all sources.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as MSG.” False. E1413 is a modified starch thickener, not [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), which is a flavour enhancer.
- “Phosphate in the name means it adds a lot of phosphorus.” Misleading. Only small amounts of phosphate groups are bound to the starch; the body handles the ingredient largely like ordinary starch.[^3]
- “Modified starches aren’t allowed in the U.S.” False. FDA permits food starch‑modified made with specified reagents and processes.[^1]

## Phosphated distarch phosphate in branded foods
On packaging, look for “phosphated distarch phosphate,” “E1413,” or the generic term “modified starch.” You’ll most often see it in gravies, sauces, pie fillings, and frozen entrées that need to stay thick and stable through transport, storage, and reheating. If you are checking for source (corn, potato, tapioca, wheat), some brands voluntarily disclose it, or you can ask the manufacturer.
