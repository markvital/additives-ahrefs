      "q": "what is sodium magnesium silicate & tetrasodium pyrophosphate",
      "a": "They are different inorganic food additives: sodium magnesium silicate is a mineral-based anti-caking/thickening agent that helps powders stay free‑flowing, while tetrasodium pyrophosphate (a phosphate) is a sequestrant/buffer used to improve texture and water binding; both are distinct from E546 (magnesium pyrophosphate).",
