Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (E468) is a modified form of cellulose that swells in water to make mixtures thicker and more stable. Food makers use it in small amounts to steady texture, keep ingredients from separating, and improve mouthfeel in many everyday foods. It is closely related to cellulose gum (E466) but is cross‑linked so it doesn’t dissolve the same way.

## At a glance
- What it is: a cross‑linked form of cellulose gum made from plant cellulose
- What it does: thickener and stabiliser that controls water, texture, and suspension
- Common in: sauces, dressings, dairy and plant‑based desserts, fillings, and gluten‑free baked goods
- Label names: E468, cross‑linked cellulose gum, crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium
- Safety: authorised in the EU; re‑evaluated with no safety concern at typical use levels; no numerical ADI (acceptable daily intake) set

## Why is Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose added to food?
Manufacturers add E468 to manage water and texture. It helps thicken liquids, suspend particles, reduce “weeping” (syneresis) in gels and fillings, and stabilise emulsions like dressings and sauces. Because it is cross‑linked, it swells without fully dissolving, which can give a creamy, stable feel even at low use levels.

## What foods contain Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose?
E468 appears across many categories where extra body or stability is needed. You may find it in:
- Pourable dressings and mayonnaise‑type sauces
- Tomato sauces and ready‑to‑eat meals
- Dairy and plant‑based desserts, whipped toppings, and non‑dairy creams
- Fruit preparations, jams, and pastry fillings
- Gluten‑free breads, cakes, and snack coatings

In the European Union, E468 is an authorised additive and is reported across a broad range of food categories as a thickener and stabiliser.[^1]

## What can replace Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose?
The best substitute depends on the recipe and label goals:
- Fermented gums such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}
- Seed gums like [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive} or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}
- Seaweed extracts such as [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive} or [processed eucheuma seaweed](/e407a-processed-eucheuma-seaweed){.additive}
- Fruit pectins like [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- Other cellulose derivatives, for example [sodium carboxy methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose){.additive} (non‑cross‑linked), [hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose](/e464-hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose){.additive}, or [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}

## How is Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose made?
E468 starts with plant cellulose from wood pulp or cotton. The cellulose is first turned into sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) by adding carboxymethyl groups. Then the CMC chains are lightly cross‑linked—often using agents such as epichlorohydrin—so the final material swells in water but does not fully dissolve. Official EU specifications set identity tests and impurity limits for this additive.[^2]

## Is Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose safe to eat?
EFSA—the European Food Safety Authority—reviewed cellulose and modified celluloses (including E468) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels. EFSA did not establish a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) because the available data did not indicate a need for one.[^1] In digestion, these cellulose derivatives are not absorbed intact and are largely excreted; limited fermentation by gut bacteria may occur, and high intakes can cause mild, reversible gastrointestinal effects like gas or loose stools, similar to other non‑digestible fibers.[^1]

## Does Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose have any benefits?
For food makers, it offers reliable thickening, helps prevent separation, and keeps textures smooth over shelf life and temperature swings. Its swelling, rather than dissolving, can provide body without a gummy or slimy feel when properly formulated.

## Who should avoid Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose?
Most people do not need to avoid E468. Anyone who notices digestive discomfort from fiber‑like additives may choose to limit foods thickened with cellulose derivatives. If you are on a medically restricted diet, follow your healthcare provider’s advice about thickeners and stabilisers.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E468 is plastic.” Fact: It is a plant‑derived cellulose modified to change how it behaves in water.
- Myth: “It adds a lot of sodium.” Fact: E468 is a sodium salt, but it is used in very small amounts, so sodium contribution in a serving is typically trivial.
- Myth: “It’s the same as E466.” Fact: E466 and E468 are closely related; E466 dissolves, while E468 is cross‑linked so it mainly swells. That difference changes texture and stability.

## Cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “E468,” “cross‑linked cellulose gum,” “crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,” or “croscarmellose sodium.” It often appears alongside other stabilisers, such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}, or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, especially in sauces, desserts, fillings, and gluten‑free bakery items.
