Sodium dodecyl sulfate (E487), also called sodium lauryl sulfate, is a strong surfactant used in small amounts to help foods foam, mix, or hold air. In the U.S. it’s allowed for specific uses like whipping and emulsifying, while rules differ in other regions.

## At a glance
- What it is: An anionic surfactant (a soap-like molecule with a charged head) used to help ingredients mix and hold foam.
- What it does in food: Works as an emulsifier, whipping agent, and wetting agent to improve texture and stability.
- Where it’s used: Certain U.S. foods under strict limits; it is not on the current EU Union list of permitted additives.
- Also listed as: Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laurilsulfate, SDS, NaDS, E487.
- Dietary notes: Synthetic; typically suitable for vegans and vegetarians.

## Why is sodium dodecyl sulfate added to food?
Manufacturers use sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for its surface-active properties. It helps water and oil mix (emulsification), makes foams more stable (whipping agent), and allows liquids to spread or penetrate powders more easily (wetting). These functions can improve volume, consistency, and even flavor dispersion in some recipes. In the U.S., these roles and the foods where they’re allowed are set out in federal regulations.[^1]

## What foods contain sodium dodecyl sulfate?
In the U.S., SDS may be used only in certain foods and only for the purposes and limits described in regulation. Common examples include specific bakery and confectionery items and as a whipping aid (for example, in dried or reconstituted egg-white foams), when permitted by the rule it cites.[^1] If present, it must appear on the ingredient list as sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate.

## What can replace sodium dodecyl sulfate?
Depending on the job, formulators often choose:
- Emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), or sucrose esters ([sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)).
- Polysorbates: For oil-in-water emulsions, polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters like [polysorbate 80](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate) are common.
- Hydrocolloids for foam/texture: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) can stabilize foams and improve body.

The right substitute depends on whether the goal is foaming, emulsifying, or stabilizing.

## How is sodium dodecyl sulfate made?
SDS is typically produced by sulfating lauryl alcohol (dodecanol) with sulfur trioxide or chlorosulfonic acid to make lauryl sulfate, then neutralizing it with sodium hydroxide to form the sodium salt. Lauryl alcohol can be derived from plant oils (such as coconut or palm kernel) or synthesized from petrochemical sources.[^2]

## Is sodium dodecyl sulfate safe to eat?
Safety and use depend on jurisdiction. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows SDS in specified foods, for specific purposes, and within stated limits, which reflects a safety determination for those uses.[^1] In the European Union, E487 is not included on the current Union list of authorized food additives in Annex II of the food additive regulation, so it is not permitted as a food additive there.[^3] Like many surfactants, concentrated SDS can irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes, but the amounts used in foods are much lower than levels that cause irritation.[^2]

## Does sodium dodecyl sulfate have any benefits?
Yes. In small regulated amounts, SDS can:
- Stabilize foams (for example, in whipped systems), improving volume and lightness.
- Help oil-based flavors disperse evenly.
- Improve mixing and batter consistency as a wetting agent.[^1]

## Who should avoid sodium dodecyl sulfate?
- People who are sensitive to surfactants may prefer to avoid products listing sodium lauryl sulfate.
- If your healthcare provider recommends avoiding strong surfactants due to a specific condition, check labels.
- EU shoppers rarely see it in foods because E487 is not on the Union list of permitted additives.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “SDS is a soap, so it isn’t allowed in any foods.” Fact: In the U.S., SDS is allowed for limited, well-defined uses with strict limits.[^1]
- Myth: “An E-number means it’s banned somewhere.” Fact: An E-number is just a European identifier for additives; whether an additive is allowed depends on each region’s rules.[^3]
- Myth: “If it’s in toothpaste, it can’t be safe in food.” Fact: Many substances have multiple uses; what matters is the allowed food uses and levels set by regulators.[^1]

## sodium dodecyl sulfate in branded foods
You’re most likely to find it on U.S. labels of specific confections, bakery mixes, or whipping aids where regulations allow it. Look for the names “sodium lauryl sulfate” or “sodium dodecyl sulfate” in the ingredient list. In the EU, you generally won’t see E487 on food labels because it isn’t authorized.[^3]
