Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (E466) is a modified cellulose often called cellulose gum. It is used to thicken, stabilize, and keep foods smooth and creamy. You will find it in sauces, ice cream, and many baked goods.

## At a glance
- What it is: a plant‑based, modified cellulose known as CMC or cellulose gum
- What it does: thickens, stabilizes, binds water, and helps textures stay even
- Where it’s used: sauces and dressings, dairy and non‑dairy desserts, bakery, drinks
- Label names: “sodium carboxymethylcellulose,” “carboxymethyl cellulose,” “CMC,” “cellulose gum”
- Dietary notes: not from animal sources; gluten‑free by nature

## Why is Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose added to food?
Food makers add CMC to control texture and moisture. It helps sauces and drinks stay mixed, keeps ice crystals small in frozen desserts, and gives body to reduced‑fat or reduced‑sugar recipes. It also helps bread and gluten‑free doughs hold water and stay soft.

## What foods contain Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose?
You may find E466 in:
- Sauces, gravies, marinades, and salad dressings
- Ice cream, sherbet, frozen yogurt, and dairy‑free frozen desserts
- Puddings and custards
- Plant‑based milks and flavored beverages
- Baked goods and gluten‑free items
- Chewing gum and confectionery

It often appears alongside other hydrocolloids (water‑binding gums) such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}, [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive}, [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}, or [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive}.

## What can replace Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose?
Close stand‑ins depend on the job:
- To thicken and stabilize liquids: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, or [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- To improve body in low‑fat items: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive} or [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive}
- For moisture in baked goods: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, or [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive}
- For mouthfeel in drinks: [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive} or [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}

Choice depends on pH, salt, temperature, and the food’s flavor. For example, pectin sets best in acidic fruit systems, while xanthan remains stable over wide pH and heat ranges.

## How is Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose made?
CMC starts with cellulose from wood pulp or cotton. Producers treat cellulose with an alkali (sodium hydroxide) to form “alkali cellulose,” then react it with sodium monochloroacetate. This step adds carboxymethyl groups to the cellulose chain, creating the sodium salt that dissolves in water. The product is then purified and dried to meet strict identity and purity criteria in the EU’s additive specifications.[^2]

## Is Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose safe to eat?
In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium carboxymethylcellulose as “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated the celluloses group (E 460–E 469), including E466, and found no safety concern at reported uses and levels; EFSA did not set a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI).[^3]

As a large, non‑digestible polymer, CMC is not absorbed by the gut. High amounts may cause softer stools or gas in some people, a typical effect of poorly digested carbohydrates.[^3]

## Does Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose have any benefits?
CMC can improve texture while allowing less fat or sugar, helping foods stay creamy or stable with fewer calories from those ingredients. It is not absorbed by the body and provides little to no usable energy.[^3] In bakery and gluten‑free doughs, it helps hold water and improve softness.

## Who should avoid Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose?
Most people do not need to avoid E466. A few may notice mild digestive discomfort if they consume large amounts, especially from several products in a day. If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit certain additives or you are following a special medical diet, check labels and ask for guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “CMC is plastic.” Fact: It is made by modifying plant cellulose so it dissolves and thickens water‑based foods.
- Myth: “CMC contains gluten.” Fact: It is not made from wheat proteins and is gluten‑free by nature.
- Myth: “All gums are the same.” Fact: Different gums work best under different conditions (pH, heat, salt); CMC is especially good for stable viscosity and moisture control.

## Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “sodium carboxymethylcellulose,” “carboxymethyl cellulose,” “CMC,” or “cellulose gum.” It often appears with other gums for a smoother texture, especially in:
- Ice creams and frozen desserts (to control ice crystals)
- Shelf‑stable sauces and dressings (to keep particles suspended)
- Gluten‑free breads and tortillas (for softness and flexibility)
- Ready‑to‑drink coffees, teas, and flavored milks (for body and mouthfeel)
