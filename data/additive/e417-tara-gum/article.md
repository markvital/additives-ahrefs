Tara gum (E417) is a plant-based thickener and stabiliser made from the seeds of the tara tree. It helps foods feel creamy, stay mixed, and keep their shape during cooking and freezing. On labels you may see it as “tara gum” or “E417”.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural gum from the seed endosperm of the tara tree (Caesalpinia spinosa).
- What it does: Thickens, stabilises, and improves texture in foods.
- Where it’s used: Ice cream, sauces, dressings, dairy and dairy-alternative drinks, baked goods, and more.
- Dietary notes: Vegan and gluten-free by nature.
- On labels: Listed as “tara gum” or “E417.”

## Why is Tara gum added to food?
Tara gum makes liquids thicker and creamier, so sauces cling better and desserts feel rich. It also keeps ingredients from separating and helps foods hold up to heat and freezing. It often works even better when paired with other gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), which can create a smoother, more stable texture.

## What foods contain Tara gum?
You’ll commonly find tara gum in:
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Yogurt and dairy-alternative drinks
- Sauces, dressings, and dips
- Baked goods and fillings
- Ready-to-eat meals and soups

Not every product in these categories uses tara gum, but these are the places where it’s most useful.

## What can replace Tara gum?
Depending on the recipe and texture you want, similar thickeners can stand in:
- [Guar gum](/e412-guar-gum) for strong thickening in cold liquids
- [Locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum) for creamy, gel-like textures
- [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) for stable thickening across a wide pH and temperature range
- [Carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate) for specific gel and stabilising needs

Each behaves a bit differently, so small trials are often needed.

## How is Tara gum made?
Tara gum comes from the endosperm (the gummy center) of tara seeds. The typical process removes the seed hull and germ, then mills and purifies the endosperm to produce the gum powder that meets purity specifications for food use.[^1]

## Is Tara gum safe to eat?
In the European Union, tara gum is an authorised food additive with official identity and purity specifications.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated tara gum and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels in food.[^2] Like other plant gums, it is not absorbed to a significant extent and can be fermented by gut bacteria; very high intakes may cause gas or softer stools in some people.[^2]

A separate ingredient called “tara flour” (made from ground seed parts, not the purified gum) was linked to an adverse event investigation in 2022; this was not tara gum.[^3]

## Does Tara gum have any benefits?
For food makers and cooks, tara gum:
- Improves body and creaminess
- Helps prevent ice crystals in frozen items
- Stabilises emulsions so sauces and dressings don’t separate
- Enhances bake stability and moisture retention

These technical benefits can make foods taste and feel better while keeping recipes consistent.

## Who should avoid Tara gum?
Most people can consume tara gum in normal food amounts. If you have been told to limit certain fermentable fibers, have a sensitivity to gum additives, or are following medical advice about thickening agents, discuss tara gum with your healthcare provider. Also note that “tara flour” is a different ingredient from tara gum and was the subject of an FDA investigation in 2022.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Tara gum and tara flour are the same thing.  
  Fact: They’re different ingredients. Tara gum is the purified seed endosperm used as an additive; tara flour is a broader seed preparation and was linked to a 2022 investigation, not the gum.[^3]
- Myth: Tara gum is synthetic.  
  Fact: It’s plant-derived and has EU specifications that define its natural source and purity.[^1]
- Myth: There’s no safety review.  
  Fact: EFSA has evaluated tara gum as a food additive and found no safety concern at reported uses.[^2]

## Tara gum in branded foods
Look for “tara gum” or “E417” in the ingredient list. It often appears alongside other texture helpers like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum). If you’re comparing products, check similar items such as ice creams, sauces, or plant-based milks to see how common it is.
