Neutral methacrylate copolymer (E1206) is a film‑forming polymer used to coat tablets and similar solid supplements. It helps protect the product, mask taste, and control how fast it breaks down in the gut. It is authorised in the European Union for specific uses and made to strict purity rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: a neutral acrylic-based polymer used as a glazing agent and film former on solid supplements.
- Where it’s used: mainly on coated tablets, capsules, and pellets sold as food supplements in the EU.
- Why it’s used: to protect from moisture, improve swallowability, mask taste, and manage disintegration or release.
- Also known as: E1206; part of the methacrylate copolymer family alongside [basic](/e1205-basic-methacrylate-copolymer) and [anionic](/e1207-anionic-methacrylate-copolymer) types.
- EU status: authorised for defined uses and subject to detailed specifications.

## Why is Neutral methacrylate copolymer added to food?
Manufacturers add E1206 to create smooth, protective coatings on solid food supplements. The coating can keep tablets from absorbing moisture, reduce dusting or chipping, and help them slide down more easily. It can also mask bitter tastes and fine‑tune how fast a tablet falls apart after swallowing.

## What foods contain Neutral methacrylate copolymer?
In the European Union (EU), E1206 is authorised mainly for use on solid food supplements (for example, coated tablets, capsules, and pellets). It functions as a glazing agent and film former, and its permitted use and conditions are listed in the Union list of food additives.[^2]

## What can replace Neutral methacrylate copolymer?
Depending on the goal, several alternatives can be used:
- For simple shine and moisture protection: [shellac](/e904-shellac), [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax).
- For clear, flexible films: [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan) or [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol).
- For tastemasking or sustained release: [ethyl cellulose](/e462-ethyl-cellulose) or [polyvinylpyrrolidone](/e1201-polyvinylpyrrolidone).
- Within the same family, other options include [basic methacrylate copolymer](/e1205-basic-methacrylate-copolymer) and [anionic methacrylate copolymer](/e1207-anionic-methacrylate-copolymer), chosen for different pH‑dependent behaviors.

## How is Neutral methacrylate copolymer made?
E1206 is produced by polymerising (joining together) small molecules called monomers into a large, inert polymer. According to the EU specification, it is a copolymer made primarily from methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate, typically prepared as an aqueous dispersion for coating use. The specification sets strict limits for residual monomers, solvents, and other impurities to ensure consistent quality and safety.[^1]

## Is Neutral methacrylate copolymer safe to eat?
In the EU, an additive is listed for use only after risk assessment and the setting of purity criteria. For E1206, detailed specifications cover identity and maximum levels of residual monomers and other contaminants, and its use is authorised under defined conditions in the Union list.[^1][^2] When manufacturers follow these rules (often referred to as “quantum satis,” meaning only as much as needed for the intended effect), its use in permitted foods is considered acceptable by EU regulators.[^2]

## Does Neutral methacrylate copolymer have any benefits?
Yes. In solid supplements, a thin E1206 coating can:
- Protect tablets from moisture and handling damage.
- Make tablets easier to swallow and less dusty.
- Mask bitter or metallic tastes.
- Help manage disintegration or release timing so the product performs as intended.

## Who should avoid Neutral methacrylate copolymer?
Most people do not need to avoid E1206 when it appears on permitted foods. If you have been advised to avoid coated supplements, or if you have concerns about acrylic materials due to past sensitivities, discuss options with a healthcare professional. Children or adults who struggle with swallowing coated tablets may prefer uncoated forms.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s plastic, so it must be unsafe.” Fact: E1206 is a high‑purity food additive with strict EU limits on residual monomers and impurities; it is authorised only for specific uses and levels.[^1]
- “All methacrylate coatings act the same.” Fact: Neutral (E1206), [basic](/e1205-basic-methacrylate-copolymer), and [anionic](/e1207-anionic-methacrylate-copolymer) copolymers behave differently, so formulators pick the type that suits the product.
- “It’s used in all kinds of foods.” Fact: In the EU, its use is focused on solid food supplements and must follow the Union list conditions.[^2]

## Neutral methacrylate copolymer in branded foods
You are most likely to find E1206 on labels of coated vitamin, mineral, or herbal tablets and hard pellets sold as food supplements. In the EU, labels list additives by their function and name or E‑number, so you might see “glazing agent: E1206.”[^3]
