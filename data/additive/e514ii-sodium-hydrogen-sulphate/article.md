Sodium hydrogen sulphate (E514ii), also called sodium bisulphate or acid sodium sulphate, is an acidic mineral salt used to control acidity in foods. It helps set pH, supports leavening when paired with baking soda, and is also used in some processing steps to slow microbial growth.

## At a glance
- What it is: An acidic sodium salt of sulphuric acid (chemical formula NaHSO4) that dissolves to make solutions with a low pH.
- What it does: Controls acidity (pH), can act as the acid in baking systems, and is used during meat and poultry processing to lower pH.
- Where it appears: Various processed foods and processing solutions; listed on labels as sodium bisulphate, sodium acid sulphate, sodium hydrogen sulphate, or E514(ii).
- Diet and allergens: Not an allergen; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.
- Taste: Sour/acidic; used at small amounts so it does not add a strong flavor.

## Why is Sodium hydrogen sulphate added to food?
Food makers use sodium hydrogen sulphate to adjust and hold a product’s acidity (pH). Stable pH can improve taste, texture, color, and shelf stability. In baking, an acid like sodium hydrogen sulphate can be paired with baking soda to release carbon dioxide, which helps doughs and batters rise. In the EU, sodium sulphates are listed food additives with defined identities and specifications, including E514(ii) sodium hydrogen sulphate.[^1] In the United States, it is considered a safe and suitable acidity control ingredient for meat and poultry processing by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).[^3]

## What foods contain Sodium hydrogen sulphate?
You may see sodium hydrogen sulphate:
- On labels of processed foods in regions where E-numbers are used (as E514(ii)), because it is an authorised additive with published specifications in EU law.[^1]
- In meat and poultry processing solutions in the U.S., where FSIS lists sodium acid sulfate as safe and suitable for lowering pH during production.[^3]

Label wording varies. Common names include sodium bisulphate, sodium acid sulphate, sodium hydrogen sulphate, or E514(ii).

## What can replace Sodium hydrogen sulphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it does in the recipe:
- To adjust acidity (pH): [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid), or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid).
- For baking systems: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) needs an acid partner such as [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate) or [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate).

## How is Sodium hydrogen sulphate made?
Industrially, sodium hydrogen sulphate is produced by partially neutralising sulphuric acid with a sodium base (such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate), yielding the acid salt NaHSO4 rather than the fully neutral sodium sulphate. Its composition and identity as E514(ii) are defined in EU additive specifications,[^1] and chemical references describe its preparation and properties as an acidic, water‑soluble salt.[^4]

## Is Sodium hydrogen sulphate safe to eat?
Regulators have assessed sulphates used as food additives. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated sulphates (E 514–517) and concluded there was no safety concern for consumers at reported use levels.[^2] In the U.S., sodium acid sulfate is listed by FSIS as safe and suitable for specified uses in meat and poultry processing when used under good manufacturing practices.[^3]

Note: “Sulfate/sulphate” additives like sodium hydrogen sulphate are different from “sulfite/sulphite” preservatives that can trigger sensitivities in some people.

## Does Sodium hydrogen sulphate have any benefits?
- Helps control pH for consistent flavor, color, and texture.
- Can serve as the acid component in baking systems to support reliable leavening when used with baking soda.
- Lowers pH in certain processing steps, which can help slow the growth of unwanted microbes during production.

## Who should avoid Sodium hydrogen sulphate?
- People who must strictly limit sodium intake should check labels, though the amounts used for pH control are typically small per serving.
- Individuals sensitive to very sour foods or drinks may prefer products acidified with milder-tasting acids.
- Very high intake of sulphates from water can have a laxative effect in people not used to it; this is a general property of sulphate salts rather than a typical risk from the small amounts used as additives.[^5]

If you have a medical condition that requires diet restrictions, ask a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s the same as sulphites. Fact: Sulphates (like sodium hydrogen sulphate) are chemically different from sulphites; sulphites are the additives linked with sensitivity in some people.
- Myth: It “bleaches” food. Fact: Its role is to adjust pH; it is not a bleaching agent.
- Myth: It is a standalone leavening agent. Fact: It provides acidity; carbon dioxide for rising comes from its reaction with baking soda.

## Sodium hydrogen sulphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for sodium bisulphate, sodium acid sulphate, sodium hydrogen sulphate, or E514(ii). Placement and prominence vary by country and product type. In the U.S., it may appear more often on processing records (for meat and poultry) than on retail labels, because it can be used during production under good manufacturing practices.[^3]
