Fast Yellow AB (E105) is a synthetic yellow colorant that was once used to tint foods. Today, it is not an approved food color in the European Union or the United States, so it should not appear in legally sold foods there.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic yellow dye used only for coloring
- Regulatory status: not authorized for use in food in the EU or the U.S.
- What you might see instead: permitted yellows such as [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine), [quinoline yellow](/e104-quinoline-yellow), or [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf)
- Nutrition: provides color only; no calories or nutrients
- Labeling: may appear as “Fast Yellow AB” or “E105” where it is allowed

## Why is Fast Yellow AB added to food?
Color makes food look consistent and appealing. Manufacturers add yellow dyes to make products look brighter, signal flavor (like “lemon”), or maintain a uniform appearance from batch to batch. Fast Yellow AB served that visual role only; it does not change taste or nutrition.

## What foods contain Fast Yellow AB?
In regions where it is not authorized—such as the European Union (EU) and the United States—you should not find Fast Yellow AB in legally marketed foods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists the food color additives that are permitted, and Fast Yellow AB is not among them.[^1] The EU’s official food additives database also does not list E105 as an authorized color for food.[^2] U.S. border authorities may detain foods that contain unapproved or undeclared colors, which can include dyes not permitted for food use.[^3]

## What can replace Fast Yellow AB?
When a yellow shade is needed, makers typically choose authorized alternatives, depending on the shade and product:
- Synthetic options: [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) (bright lemon-yellow), [quinoline yellow](/e104-quinoline-yellow) (greenish-yellow), or [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf) (orange‑yellow)
- Natural options: [saffron](/e164-saffron), [carotene](/e160a-carotene) or [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene)

Each has its own coloring strength, stability, and allowed uses set by local regulations.

## How is Fast Yellow AB made?
Fast Yellow AB is a man‑made organic dye produced by standard dye‑making steps used for many synthetic colors. In brief, chemists build the colored molecule from smaller building blocks, then purify it to meet specifications. Because it is not currently authorized for food in major markets, modern food‑grade manufacturing details and specifications are not maintained in those jurisdictions.

## Is Fast Yellow AB safe to eat?
Safety depends on regulatory review and approved uses. Fast Yellow AB has not been approved for use in food in the United States,[^1] and it is not on the EU’s list of authorized food colors.[^2] That means there is no established legal use level for foods in those regions. If you see it on a label in the EU or U.S., the product may not comply with local rules.

## Does Fast Yellow AB have any benefits?
Its only role is visual. It does not add flavor, aroma, or nutrition. Any “benefit” is the consistent yellow color it provides in products that allow it.

## Who should avoid Fast Yellow AB?
- Consumers in the EU and U.S.: avoid products that list Fast Yellow AB (E105), because it is not an authorized food color in these markets.[^1][^2]
- People who prefer to minimize artificial colors: choose products colored with permitted alternatives, including natural colors.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are approved in the EU.” Fact: some E‑numbers refer to substances that are no longer authorized; E105 is not authorized as a food color in the EU.[^2]
- Myth: “Fast Yellow AB is the same as [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine).” Fact: they are different substances with different regulatory statuses.
- Myth: “If a dye has been used somewhere before, it’s automatically allowed.” Fact: each color must be specifically authorized; unapproved colors may be refused at the border in the U.S.[^3]

## Fast Yellow AB in branded foods
Mainstream brands in the EU and U.S. do not use Fast Yellow AB in foods, because it is not authorized there.[^1][^2] If you encounter a product that lists E105 or Fast Yellow AB, be cautious—it may be an import that does not meet local rules or a mislabeled item. U.S. authorities can detain foods with unapproved colors at import.[^3]
