E414, also called acacia gum or gum arabic, is a natural gum tapped from acacia trees. It helps keep flavor oils mixed in drinks, smooths candy coatings, and adds body as a stabilizer and thickener. It is widely used in both the U.S. and the EU and is considered safe when used as intended. [^2][^3]

## At a glance
- What it is: A dried tree sap (exudate) from Acacia senegal and/or Acacia seyal, refined into a food-grade powder. [^1]
- What it does: Works as an emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, and carrier; useful for flavor emulsions and encapsulating sensitive ingredients. [^2][^3]
- Where it’s found: Soft drinks, juice drinks, candies and confectionery, bakery glazes, chewing gum, flavorings, and dietary fiber blends. [^3]
- Safety status: Authorized in the EU as E414 and re‑evaluated by EFSA with no safety concern at current uses; permitted in the U.S. under 21 CFR 172.780. [^3][^2]
- Nutrition note: The FDA allows acacia (gum arabic) to count as dietary fiber on U.S. Nutrition Facts labels. [^4]

## Why is Acacia gum added to food?
Acacia gum helps oil and water stay mixed, so citrus flavors stay evenly spread in soft drinks. It also forms a thin, shiny film on candies and nuts to protect surfaces and improve texture. As a stabiliser and thickener, it adds body without making liquids too thick, and it can carry and protect flavors, colors, and vitamins during processing and storage. [^2][^3]

## What foods contain Acacia gum?
You’ll most often see E414 on labels of:
- Soft drinks and juice drinks with citrus or spice flavors (as an emulsifier for flavor oils). [^3]
- Candy coatings, pan-coated nuts, and confectionery centers (for gloss and structure). [^3]
- Chewing gum and gummy candies (to improve chew and stability). [^3]
- Baked goods and glazes (for shine and moisture control). [^3]
- Flavorings and nutrient premixes (as a carrier or encapsulation aid). [^3]

On ingredient lists, it may appear as “acacia gum,” “gum arabic,” or simply “E414.”

## What can replace Acacia gum?
There is no single one‑to‑one swap, but formulators may try:
- Other gums that build body or stabilize, such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan).
- Beverage oil emulsifiers like [sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate) or [glycerol esters of wood rosin](/e445-glycerol-esters-of-wood-rosin) for flavor stabilization in drinks.
- Pectin systems such as [pectins](/e440-pectins) or selected [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch) for specific textures.

Each option has trade‑offs in taste, clarity, viscosity, and cost, so the best choice depends on the product.

## How is Acacia gum made?
Acacia trees are tapped so that small amounts of sap exude and harden on the trunk. The dried “tears” are collected, cleaned, dissolved in water, filtered, pasteurised, and then dried (often by spray‑drying) into a fine powder that meets food specifications. The EU specification defines gum arabic as the dried exudate from Acacia senegal and/or Acacia seyal and sets identity and purity criteria. [^1][^3]

## Is Acacia gum safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated acacia gum (E414) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels; the acceptable daily intake (ADI) was “not specified,” which is used for additives of very low toxicity when used as intended. [^3] In the U.S., acacia (gum arabic) is permitted as a direct food additive under 21 CFR 172.780. [^2]

Some people may notice gas or mild digestive discomfort if they suddenly consume large amounts, as it is a fermentable soluble fiber. [^3]

## Does Acacia gum have any benefits?
Acacia gum is a soluble dietary fiber. The FDA allows it to be included in “dietary fiber” on Nutrition Facts labels, reflecting evidence that it contributes to physiological benefits of fiber when eaten as part of the diet. [^4] Like other fermentable fibers, it can be broken down by gut bacteria to short‑chain fatty acids, which is one way fiber supports gut health. [^3]

## Who should avoid Acacia gum?
- People with a known allergy to acacia gum or products containing it should avoid it. Such allergies are uncommon but have been reported. [^3]
- Individuals advised by a healthcare professional to limit fiber (for example, around certain medical procedures) should follow that advice.
- If you have ongoing digestive conditions and are sensitive to fermentable fibers, introduce products with acacia gum gradually and monitor tolerance. [^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Acacia gum is a synthetic glue.” Fact: It is a natural tree exudate that is cleaned and dried for food use. [^1]
- Myth: “All gums are the same.” Fact: Acacia gum behaves differently from [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [pectins](/e440-pectins); formulators choose based on clarity, thickness, and stability needs. [^3]
- Myth: “It isn’t allowed in the U.S.” Fact: It is permitted under 21 CFR 172.780 and widely used in foods. [^2]

## Acacia gum in branded foods
You can find E414 on ingredient lists across many aisles:
- Carbonated and still soft drinks with citrus flavors.
- Pan‑coated candies and nut mixes with shiny shells.
- Chewing gum, gummies, and jellies.
- Bakery glazes and icing decorations.
- Flavor and vitamin blends in shelf‑stable foods.

Look for the names “acacia gum,” “gum arabic,” or “E414” on the label.
