Isobutane (E943b) is a colorless, odorless gas used as a propellant in sprayable foods like cooking oils and whipped toppings. It helps push the product out of the can and quickly evaporates, leaving little to no residue in the food.

## At a glance
- What it is: A simple hydrocarbon gas (also called a liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG) used as a food-grade propellant.
- What it does: Pressurizes cans so foods spray or foam evenly, then flashes off when released.
- Common uses: Aerosol cooking sprays, sprayable oils, whipped toppings, and similar products.
- Diet notes: Vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and allergen-free (it’s just a gas, not a protein or carbohydrate).
- Safety notes: Approved in the EU and the U.S. for use as a propellant under strict purity rules. The gas is highly flammable—follow label directions and keep away from heat sources.[^1][^3]

## Why is Isobutane added to food?
Isobutane is added as a propellant—the pressurized gas that forces a liquid or foam out of a can when you press the nozzle. Inside the can, the gas sits above or within the product. When the valve opens, the pressure drops, the gas expands, and the food sprays out in a fine mist or forms a foam. It is authorized as a food additive in the EU and used under good manufacturing practice in the U.S. for this purpose.[^2][^3]

## What foods contain Isobutane?
You’ll most often find isobutane in:
- Aerosol cooking sprays and sprayable oils
- Whipped creams and dessert toppings in pressurized cans
- Certain sprayable flavorings and release agents

On ingredient lists, look for “isobutane,” “propellant (isobutane),” or “E943b.”

## What can replace Isobutane?
Depending on the product, manufacturers may use other food-grade propellants or gases:
- [Butane](/e943a-butane)
- [Propane](/e944-propane)
- [Carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) (common in beverages and some foams)
- [Nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) (common in whipped cream systems)
- [Nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen) (for inert packaging or dispensing)

The best alternative depends on how the product needs to spray or foam, flavor neutrality, and packaging design.

## How is Isobutane made?
Food-grade isobutane is sourced from natural gas processing and petroleum refining, then purified for food use.[^4] In the EU, detailed specifications limit impurities such as 1,3-butadiene (typically to very low levels, e.g., not more than 1 mg/kg), helping ensure high purity for use in foods.[^1]

## Is Isobutane safe to eat?
Regulators consider isobutane safe when used as intended as a propellant. In the EU, it is listed as E943b with strict identity and purity criteria; in the U.S., it is permitted for use in foods under good manufacturing practice.[^1][^3] Because it is a gas that evaporates as the product is dispensed, only trace amounts, if any, remain in the food. Note that isobutane is highly flammable and can displace oxygen in enclosed spaces—household products should be used as labeled and kept away from heat or open flames.[^5]

## Does Isobutane have any benefits?
- Produces a fine, even spray for oils and flavorings.
- Helps form light foams in whipped toppings.
- Inert in normal use—does not add taste, color, or texture of its own.

## Who should avoid Isobutane?
- Anyone avoiding aerosol products for household safety (for example, homes using oxygen therapy or with open flames).
- People sensitive to aerosols or propellant odors may prefer non-spray formats.
There are no known allergen concerns from isobutane itself.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are harmful.” Fact: E-numbers are just codes for approved additives; isobutane (E943b) is evaluated for safety and purity before use.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “The gas stays in my food.” Fact: As a propellant, isobutane rapidly evaporates as the product leaves the can, so little to none remains in the food.
- Myth: “Isobutane adds flavor.” Fact: It is neutral and used for pressure, not taste.

## Isobutane in branded foods
You’re most likely to find isobutane in:
- Aerosol cooking sprays and sprayable oils
- Pressurized whipped creams and dessert toppings
Check the back label for “propellant: isobutane” or “E943b.”
