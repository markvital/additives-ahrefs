      "q": "how do the global warming potentials of isobutane",
      "a": "Isobutane (R-600a) has a very low GWP—about 3 over 100 years and roughly 10 over 20 years (values vary slightly by IPCC assessment). That’s far lower than many HFC propellants, and its ozone-depletion potential is 0.",

    {
      "q": "what is isobutane used for",
      "a": "As food additive E943b, it’s used as a propellant/expellant gas in aerosols like whipped cream and cooking sprays. Beyond foods, it’s also used as a refrigerant (R-600a), a fuel for lighters/camping stoves, and a foam-blowing agent.",

    {
      "q": "what is the difference between butane and isobutane",
      "a": "They’re structural isomers: n-butane (E943a) is straight-chain, while isobutane (E943b) is branched. Isobutane’s lower boiling point gives higher vapor pressure and better cold-weather performance; both are highly flammable gases used as propellants.",

    {
      "q": "how do global warming potentials of isobutane",
      "a": "On a 100‑year basis, isobutane’s GWP is about 3; on a 20‑year basis it’s roughly 10, depending on the IPCC report cited. These values are very low compared with common HFC propellants, and its ODP is 0.",

    {
      "q": "how long do isobutane canisters last",
      "a": "Run time depends on canister size and stove output; a typical 230 g canister fuels about 1.5–3 hours at moderate heat (less in cold or high power). Unopened canisters keep for many years if stored cool and dry; always follow the manufacturer’s guidance.",
