Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), also known as E476, is an emulsifier that helps fat-based foods flow smoothly. It is best known for improving the texture and handling of chocolate and compound coatings used in candy and bakery products. Manufacturers use it in tiny amounts to make chocolate easier to mold, coat, and enrobe.

## At a glance
Here are the quick facts before we dive deeper.

- What it is: An emulsifier made from polyglycerols and fatty acids from castor oil
- Also called: PGPR, E476
- What it does: Lowers viscosity so chocolate and coatings flow and spread more easily
- Where it’s found: Chocolate, compound coatings, confectionery fillings, and some spreads
- Label check: “Polyglycerol polyricinoleate,” “PGPR,” or “E476”
- Regulatory status: Authorized for use in the EU and the U.S.
- Typical use level: Very small amounts relative to the food; used to fine-tune texture

## Why is Polyglycerol polyricinoleate added to food?
Chocolate can be thick and hard to handle during making and coating. PGPR helps by reducing viscosity (thickness), which allows chocolate and similar coatings to flow, spread, and release from molds more easily.[^1] It is often used alongside [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) to fine-tune texture and processing.

## What foods contain Polyglycerol polyricinoleate?
You’ll most often find PGPR in:
- Chocolate bars and chips
- Compound coatings used on wafers, cookies, and ice cream novelties
- Confectionery fillings and some chocolate spreads

On labels, look for “PGPR,” “polyglycerol polyricinoleate,” or “E476.”

## What can replace Polyglycerol polyricinoleate?
Food makers may choose other emulsifiers, depending on the product:
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (often from soy or sunflower)
- [Ammonium phosphatides](/e442-ammonium-phosphatides) (another common chocolate emulsifier)
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- [Sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate)
- [Sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- [Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids)

Each behaves a bit differently, so the choice depends on the desired flow, gloss, melt, and flavor release.

## How is Polyglycerol polyricinoleate made?
PGPR is made by combining two parts:
- Polyglycerols (formed by linking small molecules of glycerol together)
- Condensed ricinoleic acid (a fatty acid from refined castor oil)

These are then esterified (chemically joined) to form the final emulsifier, which is tailored for use in foods.[^2] The manufacturing and purity are controlled by food additive specifications that define its composition and quality.[^2]

## Is Polyglycerol polyricinoleate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed PGPR and set limits that protect consumers. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day and concluded there is no safety concern for its current authorized uses and exposure levels.[^3] In the United States, it is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specified uses as an emulsifier,[^1] and in the European Union it is listed with defined identity and purity specifications.[^2]

ADI means the amount you can consume every day over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority. FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

## Does Polyglycerol polyricinoleate have any benefits?
For manufacturers, PGPR makes chocolate easier to work with, which can help create thinner, more even coatings and smooth textures. For consumers, that translates to consistent snap, melt, and mouthfeel in chocolate and coated treats.

## Who should avoid Polyglycerol polyricinoleate?
There are no specific population warnings identified by major regulators for PGPR at approved use levels. If you are following an emulsifier-free diet, have been advised to limit emulsifiers, or prefer to avoid certain processing aids, you can skip products listing E476/PGPR. As always, people with medical conditions should follow advice from their healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “PGPR replaces all the cocoa butter in chocolate.”
  Fact: It is used in very small amounts to manage flow; it does not replace cocoa butter’s flavor or core structure.

- Myth: “PGPR contains ricin from castor beans.”
  Fact: PGPR is made from refined castor oil fatty acids, not from the protein portion of the seed. Food-grade specifications control its identity and purity.[^2]

- Myth: “PGPR is a new, untested additive.”
  Fact: It has been evaluated by food safety authorities and is authorized with defined specifications and intake limits.[^3]

## Polyglycerol polyricinoleate in branded foods
You’ll commonly see PGPR on the ingredient lists of mass‑market chocolate bars, baking chocolates, wafer and cookie coatings, and some chocolate spreads. Look for “PGPR,” “polyglycerol polyricinoleate,” or “E476” near other emulsifiers like lecithin.
