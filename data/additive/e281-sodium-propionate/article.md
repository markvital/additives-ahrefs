Sodium propionate (E281) is a preservative that helps stop mold from growing, especially in bread and other baked goods. It is the sodium salt of [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive} and has a mild, slightly vinegar-like note that usually does not affect taste. It is widely used and regulated for safety in many countries.

## At a glance
- What it is: Sodium salt of [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive}, used as a preservative to inhibit mold.
- Where it’s used: Packaged bread, tortillas, bagels, cakes, and other bakery items; some ready-to-eat foods.
- Also called: E281, sodium propionate.
- Dietary notes: Vegan-friendly and gluten-free; not a common allergen.
- Regulation: Permitted in many countries; in the U.S. it is allowed when used under current good manufacturing practices.

## Why is Sodium propionate added to food?
Food makers add sodium propionate to slow the growth of molds and some bacteria. That helps keep bread and other baked goods fresh longer and reduces food waste. In the U.S., regulations list sodium propionate as a direct food additive that functions as an antimicrobial preservative when used in line with current good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium propionate?
You’ll most often see it on labels for:
- Packaged sliced bread, rolls, bagels, English muffins, and tortillas
- Sweet baked goods like cakes, buns, and pastries
- Some ready-to-eat or refrigerated dough products

Label wording may read “sodium propionate,” “E281,” or “preservative (E281).”

## What can replace Sodium propionate?
Possible substitutes depend on the recipe and pH of the food:
- Other propionates: [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} or [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive}
- Sorbates: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}, common in baked goods and cheeses
- Benzoates for acidic foods: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive}
- Acidulants and “clean label” options: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive} (vinegar), [buffered vinegar](/e267-buffered-vinegar){.additive}
- Specialty antimicrobials in certain foods: [nisin](/e234-nisin){.additive} or [natamycin](/e235-natamycin){.additive} for cheese surfaces

## How is Sodium propionate made?
Sodium propionate is typically made by neutralizing [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive} with a sodium base such as [sodium hydroxide](/e524-sodium-hydroxide){.additive} or [sodium carbonates](/e500-sodium-carbonates){.additive}.[^2] The result is a white, crystalline salt that dissolves well in water and blends easily into doughs and batters.[^2]

## Is Sodium propionate safe to eat?
When used as intended, sodium propionate is considered safe. In the U.S., it is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) for use as an antimicrobial preservative under current good manufacturing practice.[^1] International expert committees have also evaluated propionic acid and its salts and found no safety concerns at typical use levels in food.[^3]

## Does Sodium propionate have any benefits?
- Keeps bread and other baked goods mold-free for longer
- Helps maintain quality during transport and storage
- Can reduce food waste by extending shelf life

## Who should avoid Sodium propionate?
- People who are following a strict low-sodium diet and want to minimize every source of sodium may choose to limit foods preserved with sodium salts.
- Anyone who notices sensitivity to a specific product should avoid that product and speak with a healthcare professional.
- For infants and young children, follow local rules and nutrition guidance on processed foods and preservatives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium propionate is the same as table salt. Fact: It contains sodium, but it is a different compound with a preservative role.
- Myth: It makes bread taste sour. Fact: It is used at low levels that do not noticeably change flavor for most people.
- Myth: It is a strong, general disinfectant. Fact: It mainly targets molds and some bacteria in foods; it is not a broad-spectrum sanitizer.

## Sodium propionate in branded foods
You’ll commonly find E281 on labels of national and store-brand sliced breads, buns, bagels, tortillas, and some packaged pastries. It may appear alongside other preservatives such as [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}. Ingredient lists typically read “sodium propionate (preservative).”
