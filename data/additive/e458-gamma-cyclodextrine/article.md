Gamma-Cyclodextrine (E458) is a ring-shaped carbohydrate made from starch. In foods, it helps carry and protect flavors, keep sensitive ingredients stable, and can slightly thicken or stabilize texture in some recipes.

## At a glance
- What it is: a cyclic carbohydrate (eight glucose units) made from starch.
- What it does: stabiliser and thickener; encapsulates and protects flavors, aromas, and some nutrients.
- Where you’ll see it: clear beverages, flavor powders, confectionery, dairy drinks, bakery fillings, and some dietary supplements.
- Label names: “E458,” “gamma-cyclodextrin,” or “Gamma-Cyclodextrine.”
- Nutrition note: neutral taste; counts as carbohydrate; used in small amounts.
- Status: approved as a food additive in the European Union.

## Why is Gamma-Cyclodextrine added to food?
Manufacturers use Gamma-Cyclodextrine because its ring-shaped structure can host small molecules—like aromas, flavors, and some lipids—forming “inclusion complexes” that protect delicate ingredients and help control taste and smell release.[^1] This can reduce bitterness, keep flavors from fading, improve solubility of some oily components, and help products stay clear and stable over time.[^1]

At higher use levels, it may also contribute a mild thickening or stabilising effect, supporting texture in mixes, fillings, and beverages.

## What foods contain Gamma-Cyclodextrine?
You’re most likely to find E458 in:
- Clear soft drinks and flavored waters to protect aromas and maintain clarity
- Powdered drink mixes and instant flavors
- Confectionery and chewing gum for flavor control
- Dairy drinks, puddings, and creamy fillings for stability
- Flavor emulsions and encapsulated vitamin or aroma systems

On labels, look for “E458,” “gamma-cyclodextrin,” or “Gamma-Cyclodextrine.”

## What can replace Gamma-Cyclodextrine?
There’s no one-size-fits-all substitute; the best replacement depends on the job it’s doing.

- For encapsulating flavors or improving solubility:
  - [Alpha-Cyclodextrine](/e457-alpha-cyclodextrine) or [Beta-Cyclodextrine](/e459-beta-cyclodextrine) can sometimes stand in, though each has different cavity size and performance.
  - [Acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum) or [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch) are common carriers for spray-dried flavors.
- For stabilising and thickening:
  - [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate), or [pectin](/e440a-pectin) are widely used texture agents.

## How is Gamma-Cyclodextrine made?
E458 is produced from food starch (often maize or potato) using enzymes. First, cyclodextrin-forming enzymes convert starch into a mixture of ring-shaped molecules. Then the gamma fraction is separated, purified (e.g., filtration, crystallisation), and dried to specification.[^2]

## Is Gamma-Cyclodextrine safe to eat?
In the European Union, Gamma-Cyclodextrine is an authorised food additive (E458) with published purity specifications and conditions of use.[^3][^2] EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) has evaluated gamma-cyclodextrin and concluded it is safe for its intended uses in food, noting it is handled by the body as a carbohydrate.[^1]

As with other approved additives, manufacturers must use no more than necessary to achieve the desired effect.[^3]

## Does Gamma-Cyclodextrine have any benefits?
For foods and drinks, E458 helps:
- Keep flavors and aromas stable and consistent over shelf life
- Improve clarity and reduce haze in beverages
- Mask bitter or harsh notes without adding sweetness
- Protect sensitive nutrients and aromas during processing and storage[^1]

These effects can allow cleaner taste, better aroma retention, and more stable products.

## Who should avoid Gamma-Cyclodextrine?
- People tracking carbohydrate intake (for example, on very low-carb diets) may want to consider the small carbohydrate contribution from E458, especially in products with multiple carbohydrate sources.
- Anyone who has been advised to restrict certain carbohydrates should check with a healthcare professional if unsure about specific products.
- As with any ingredient, discontinue a product if you notice an unusual reaction and discuss with a professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Gamma-Cyclodextrine is an artificial sweetener.”  
  Fact: It is not a sweetener; it is a carbohydrate-based stabiliser and carrier with a neutral taste.

- Myth: “It’s a preservative that kills germs.”  
  Fact: E458 does not act as an antimicrobial preservative; it stabilises flavors and textures.

- Myth: “It contains gluten.”  
  Fact: Although made from starch, the purified additive does not contain gluten proteins.

- Myth: “It’s only used in pills.”  
  Fact: Cyclodextrins are used in both foods and pharmaceuticals; E458 is widely used in foods for flavor and stability.

## Gamma-Cyclodextrine in branded foods
You’ll usually spot it on ingredient lists as “E458” or “gamma-cyclodextrin.” It appears most often in flavored beverages, powdered drink mixes, candies and chewing gum, dairy drinks and desserts, and in products that carry delicate aromas or added vitamins. If a product highlights “stable flavor,” “clear” or “no haze,” or “protected aroma,” E458 (or a similar carrier) may be helping behind the scenes.
