Isopropyl citrates (E384) are a group of isopropyl esters of citric acid used in small amounts to protect fats and oils from going rancid. They work mainly by binding trace metals that trigger oxidation and by helping other antioxidants keep flavors and colors stable.

## At a glance
- What it is: A defined mixture of isopropyl esters of citric acid (E-number E384); functions as an antioxidant and sequestrant.
- Why it’s used: Helps slow rancidity in fats and oils by tying up metal ions and boosting antioxidant performance.
- Where it shows up: Certain fats, oils, spreads, and fat-based foods, where allowed by local rules.
- Label names: “Isopropyl citrates,” “E384.”
- Diet notes: Made from citric acid and isopropyl groups; not derived from animal sources under standard manufacturing.
- Regulatory status: Listed with specifications in the European Union; use is only permitted in specific foods and at set limits.[^1][^2]

## Why is Isopropyl citrates added to food?
Food fats and oils can turn rancid when oxygen and trace metals kick off oxidation. Isopropyl citrates act as an antioxidant and a sequestrant (a metal-binding helper), so they slow that process and help preserve flavor, aroma, and color.[^1] In practice, they are often used alongside primary antioxidants such as [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary) to improve overall stability.

“Sequestrant” means a substance that binds metal ions like iron and copper. By tying up these metals, isopropyl citrates reduce the speed of oxidation in sensitive foods like oils and fat-based spreads.[^1]

## What foods contain Isopropyl citrates?
Use depends on local laws. In the European Union, E384 is an authorized food additive with a published specification, and its use—where permitted—is restricted to certain categories (for example, some fats and oils) and subject to maximum levels.[^2][^3] Internationally, the Codex Alimentarius (the global food standards program of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization) also lists isopropyl citrates as a food additive with antioxidant function in applicable foods.[^4]

You’re most likely to see it in:
- Refined edible oils and fats
- Fat-based spreads and shortenings
- Snacks and seasonings that contain added fats

Always check the ingredient list for “Isopropyl citrates” or “E384.”

## What can replace Isopropyl citrates?
Alternatives depend on the food and the reason for use:
- Other antioxidants: [Ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary), [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate).
- Other sequestrants (metal binders): [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate), used where allowed.
- Process choices: Using fresher oils, inert gas packing, light-proof packaging, and lower storage temperatures.

The best choice depends on the product’s flavor, texture, shelf-life goals, and the regulations in the country where it is sold.

## How is Isopropyl citrates made?
The EU specification defines E384 as a mixture of the isopropyl esters of citric acid that meets set identity and purity criteria.[^1] In plain terms, this means it is made by attaching isopropyl groups to the acid functions of citric acid to form food-grade esters that behave as antioxidants and metal binders in foods.[^1]

## Is Isopropyl citrates safe to eat?
In the European Union, additives may only be used if they have been assessed and authorized, with clear conditions of use and specifications designed to protect consumers.[^2] Isopropyl citrates have such an EU specification and may be used only in the foods and at the levels permitted by law.[^1][^3]

As with any additive, total intake depends on how often and how much of the permitted foods you eat. If you have questions about your personal diet, speak with a qualified health professional.

## Does Isopropyl citrates have any benefits?
For the food itself, yes: it helps fats and oils keep their intended taste and aroma longer by slowing oxidation, which can otherwise create stale or “paint-like” off-notes. In blends with primary antioxidants, it can enhance overall antioxidant performance, supporting quality during storage and distribution.[^1]

## Who should avoid Isopropyl citrates?
- People who prefer to avoid added antioxidants or sequestrants for personal reasons can choose products with simpler ingredient lists.
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit certain additives, check labels and follow that advice.
- For infant and special medical diets, always follow product-specific guidance and regulations, and consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just citric acid.” Not quite. Isopropyl citrates are esters of citric acid designed to act as antioxidants and metal binders; they behave differently than plain [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- “If it’s in food, it must be everywhere.” Its use is limited to certain foods and levels set by law, and many products do not use it.[^2][^3]
- “All antioxidants are the same.” Different antioxidants and sequestrants work in different ways and are chosen to match the specific food.

## Isopropyl citrates in branded foods
On labels, look for “Isopropyl citrates” or “E384.” Not every oil- or fat-containing product uses it; availability varies by brand, recipe, and country. Many makers publish their full ingredient lists online or on-pack, so checking the ingredient statement is the most reliable way to know.
