      "q": "what is modified food starch",
      "a": "A group of plant-based starches that have been physically, enzymatically, or chemically treated to change how they behave in foods—improving thickening, stability, freeze–thaw performance, or emulsification (E1400–E1452).",

    {
      "q": "is modified food starch gluten free",
      "a": "Often yes when sourced from corn, potato, tapioca, or rice; if it’s from wheat, it can contain gluten unless specially processed and labeled gluten-free. In the US/EU, wheat-derived modified starch must be declared as “wheat,” so check the allergen statement or a gluten-free claim.",

    {
      "q": "what is modified corn starch",
      "a": "Modified starch made from corn that’s been treated to improve thickening, stability, and resistance to heat, acid, or shear; commonly used in sauces, soups, dressings, and desserts.",

    {
      "q": "is modified corn starch gluten free",
      "a": "Yes—corn is naturally gluten-free, and modified corn starch remains gluten-free; only potential cross-contact is a concern, so rely on allergen statements or a gluten-free label if needed.",

    {
      "q": "what is modified wheat starch",
      "a": "Starch from wheat that has been modified to alter its functionality (e.g., thicker, more stable or freeze–thaw tolerant); it may retain some gluten unless specifically purified and labeled gluten-free. “Wheat” must appear in allergen labeling in many regions.",
