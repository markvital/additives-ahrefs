Litholrubine bk (E180) is a bright red, synthetic pigment used very sparingly in foods. In the European Union, it is authorised mainly to color the outer rind of certain ripened cheeses, not the interior. It is an insoluble pigment, chosen because it stays on the surface rather than bleeding into the cheese.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of what E180 does and where you’ll see it.
- What it is: a red azo pigment also known as CI Pigment Red 57 and Lithol rubine bk
- What it does: gives a stable red color to cheese rinds
- Where it’s used: ripened cheese rinds in the EU; not a common ingredient in other foods
- Solubility: insoluble pigment, designed to remain on the surface
- Regulation: authorised in the EU for specific uses and with purity specifications

## Why is Litholrubine bk added to food?
Food makers use E180 to give a clean, uniform red color to the outer rind of some ripened cheeses. EU rules authorise its use only for the surface (rind) of specific cheese categories, which helps keep the color where it belongs rather than throughout the food.[^1] Because E180 is an insoluble pigment with defined purity requirements, it is well suited to surface coloring that should not migrate into the cheese mass.[^2]

## What foods contain Litholrubine bk?
Within the EU, E180 is allowed for use on the rind of certain ripened cheeses and is not commonly permitted across broader food categories. If present, it appears on the label as “E180” or “litholrubine bk” and is applied to the surface only.[^1] You can verify the current authorisations and food categories in the European Commission’s Food Additives Database.[^3]

## What can replace Litholrubine bk?
When a similar red or orange hue is needed, manufacturers may choose other permitted colorants depending on the food and local rules, such as:
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}
- [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}
- [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive}
- [cochineal](/e120-cochineal){.additive}

The right alternative depends on the desired shade, labeling preferences (for example, animal vs. plant derived), and where the product will be sold.

## How is Litholrubine bk made?
E180 is a synthetically produced azo pigment. In the EU, its identity and purity are defined in a legal specification that includes tests and impurity limits. These specifications also reflect its practical properties, such as being insoluble in water, which is why it functions well as a surface color for cheese rinds.[^2]

## Is Litholrubine bk safe to eat?
In the EU, additives are authorised only after a safety assessment and are restricted to uses where they are considered safe. E180 is authorised for specific uses—primarily the rind of ripened cheeses—and must meet strict identity and purity criteria.[^1][^2] Keeping the use limited to the rind and following the specification helps manage exposure.

## Does Litholrubine bk have any benefits?
For cheese makers, E180 provides a vivid, stable red color that stays on the rind during aging and handling. Because it is insoluble, it is less likely to smear or bleed into the edible interior of the cheese, helping maintain a consistent look.[^2]

## Who should avoid Litholrubine bk?
- Shoppers who prefer to avoid synthetic colors can choose cheeses without colored rinds or with alternative colorants.
- If you do not eat cheese rinds, you are unlikely to encounter E180 in the portion you consume.
- People following specific dietary guidance (for example, for children or due to personal sensitivities) can check labels and select products that fit their needs.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “This dye colors the whole cheese.” Fact: In the EU, E180 is authorised mainly for the rind (surface) of ripened cheeses, not the interior.[^1][^3]
- Myth: “Litholrubine bk is the same as carmine.” Fact: No—carmine is [cochineal](/e120-cochineal){.additive}, an insect-derived color, whereas E180 is a synthetic azo pigment.
- Myth: “It’s just a wax.” Fact: E180 is a regulated color additive with EU specifications for identity and purity; it is not a wax coating.[^2]

## Litholrubine bk in branded foods
You’re most likely to see E180 on red-rinded, ripened cheeses sold in European markets. Check the ingredient list for “E180” or “litholrubine bk,” typically listed with other rind or surface treatments. If you want to avoid it, choose cheeses without a colored rind or with a label stating a different permitted color.
