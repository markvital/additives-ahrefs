Sodium benzoate (E211) is a preservative used to keep foods and drinks from spoiling. It’s especially effective in acidic products, where it slows the growth of yeast, mold, and some bacteria. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow it within set limits for many food categories.

## At a glance
- A common preservative that helps prevent spoilage by yeast and mold in acidic foods and beverages.
- Labeled as E211 in Europe; often listed as “sodium benzoate” on ingredient labels.
- Works best at low pH (more acidic), so it’s widely used in soft drinks, fruit beverages, pickles, and sauces.
- Approved by major regulators; an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) exists to guide safe total intake.
- Can form trace benzene in certain drinks if used with vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and exposed to heat or light; manufacturers and regulators monitor and control this. 

## Why is Sodium benzoate added to food?
Sodium benzoate helps keep foods safe and fresh by slowing the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage. It’s most effective in acidic products, which is why it shows up in items like sodas, fruit drinks, and pickled foods. By extending shelf life, it helps reduce food waste and keeps flavors stable.

## What foods contain Sodium benzoate?
You’ll most often see sodium benzoate in:
- Carbonated soft drinks, flavored waters, fruit drinks and syrups
- Pickles, relishes, and other acidic condiments
- Jams, jellies, and reduced-sugar spreads
- Some sauces, dressings, and ready-to-drink teas

Use levels and allowed categories vary by country. In the European Union, sodium benzoate (E211) is authorized as a preservative in specific food categories, with maximum levels listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^5] In the United States, FDA lists sodium benzoate as an allowed additive; use must follow good manufacturing practices and any applicable category limits.[^2]

If you’re checking a label, look for “sodium benzoate” or “E211.” In beverages, it may appear alongside acidifiers like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or antioxidants such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid).

## What can replace Sodium benzoate?
Depending on the food, possible alternatives include:
- Benzoate family: [potassium benzoate](/e212-potassium-benzoate), [calcium benzoate](/e213-calcium-benzoate)
- Sorbates: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), [sodium sorbate](/e201-sodium-sorbate)
- Other preservative options in certain foods: [nisin](/e234-nisin), [natamycin](/e235-natamycin)
- Process-based options: lower pH with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), heat treatment (pasteurization), improved packaging

Note: When formulating beverages, using benzoates together with [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) requires controls to minimize benzene formation.

## How is Sodium benzoate made?
Food-grade sodium benzoate is typically produced by neutralizing benzoic acid with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, then purified to meet quality standards.[^4] Benzoic acid itself is widely manufactured and then converted to the sodium salt for better solubility in foods.[^4]

## Is Sodium benzoate safe to eat?
- EU safety review: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 5 mg per kg body weight per day for benzoic acid and its salts, including sodium benzoate.[^1] This ADI covers total exposure from all sources.  
- U.S. regulatory status: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows sodium benzoate use in foods when manufacturers follow regulations and good manufacturing practices.[^2]

Benzene in beverages: Sodium benzoate can form trace amounts of benzene when it coexists with vitamin C (ascorbic acid), especially with heat or light. FDA has tested drinks, worked with companies to reformulate when needed, and reports that products on the market generally meet safety expectations.[^3]

Sensitivity: A small number of people may report intolerance reactions (for example, hives or asthma-like symptoms), though such cases are uncommon.[^1]

ADI = Acceptable Daily Intake. EFSA = European Food Safety Authority. FDA = U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

## Does Sodium benzoate have any benefits?
- Helps keep foods and drinks safe longer by slowing spoilage microbes.
- Stabilizes flavor and quality during shelf life.
- Supports food waste reduction by extending freshness.

## Who should avoid Sodium benzoate?
- Anyone with a diagnosed benzoate allergy or sensitivity should avoid it.
- People carefully limiting sodium may want to track all sodium sources, though the amount from this preservative is usually small compared with table salt in most diets.
- If you’ve been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid benzoates, check labels for “sodium benzoate” or “E211.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium benzoate is banned in the EU or U.S.  
  Fact: It is authorized in both regions within set limits and categories.[^5][^2]
- Myth: It always creates benzene in drinks.  
  Fact: Benzene can form only under certain conditions (presence of vitamin C, heat/light). Industry and FDA monitor and manage this risk.[^3]
- Myth: It works in every food.  
  Fact: Benzoates work best in acidic foods and drinks; they’re much less effective at higher pH.

## Sodium benzoate in branded foods
You’ll commonly find E211 in ingredient lists for sodas, flavored waters, iced teas, fruit drinks, shelf-stable juices, cocktail mixers, pickles and relishes, jams and jellies (especially low-sugar types), and some condiments and dressings. Product recipes change over time, so the most reliable way to know is to scan the label for “sodium benzoate” or “E211.”
