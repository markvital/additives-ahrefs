      "q": "is sodium benzoate bad for you",
      "a": "Generally no—it's an approved preservative with an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–5 mg/kg body weight, and typical intakes are well below this. Rare sensitivities (e.g., hives/asthma-like symptoms) can occur, and in vitamin C–containing drinks exposed to heat/light it can form trace benzene, which manufacturers work to minimize.",

    {
      "q": "is sodium benzoate safe",
      "a": "Yes—it's authorized by regulators (e.g., FDA, EFSA, JECFA) with an ADI of 0–5 mg/kg body weight and is GRAS in foods up to 0.1%. Those with sensitivities may wish to limit it, and beverages containing both sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid should be protected from heat/light to prevent benzene formation.",

      "q": "is sodium benzoate safe for skin",
      "a": "Yes—it's widely used as a cosmetic preservative at low concentrations and is considered safe by regulatory and review bodies. It may occasionally cause mild irritation or sensitization, especially on very sensitive or damaged skin.",

      "q": "is sodium benzoate bad for hair",
      "a": "No—at the low levels used to preserve shampoos and conditioners it does not damage hair fibers. As with many preservatives, higher concentrations can irritate the scalp, but consumer products use small amounts.",

    {
      "q": "is sodium benzoate harmful",
      "a": "Not at permitted food and cosmetic levels; safety limits (e.g., ADI 0–5 mg/kg body weight) are set to prevent harm. Main concerns are rare intolerance reactions and trace benzene formation in vitamin C–containing drinks under heat/light, which industry monitors and minimizes.",
