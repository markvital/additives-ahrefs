Polyoxyethylene (8) stearate, also known as E430, is an emulsifier that helps oil and water stay mixed in foods. It improves texture, keeps sauces from separating, and can make whipped and creamy products more stable. In the European Union, it has defined purity rules and is listed as a permitted food additive when used as specified.

## At a glance
- Name and number: Polyoxyethylene (8) stearate (E430)
- What it does: Emulsifier that stabilizes oil-and-water mixtures
- Where you might see it: Sauces, desserts, toppings, and other creamy or aerated foods
- Label names: “E430,” “polyoxyethylene (8) stearate,” “polyethylene glycol (PEG-8) stearate,” or “PEG-8 stearate”
- Regulatory note: In the EU, E430 has official specifications and may be used where authorized categories and limits apply[^1][^2]

## Why is E430 added to food?
Manufacturers use E430 to help fat and water mix and stay mixed. This prevents separation, improves smoothness, and supports stable foams and creams during processing and storage. It can also help disperse flavors and colors evenly in a product.

## What foods contain E430?
You may find E430 in products that need a stable, creamy or uniform texture, such as:
- Pourable dressings and sauces
- Whipped toppings and dessert mixes
- Dairy analogs and coffee whiteners
- Bakery creams and fillings

Exact use depends on the recipe and the rules in each market. In the EU, permitted food categories and use levels are set in the food additives legislation.[^2]

## What can replace E430?
Several other emulsifiers and stabilizers can serve similar roles, depending on the food:
- Lecithins, often from soy or sunflower: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins)
- Glycerides: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- Polysorbates: [polysorbate 20](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate), [polysorbate 80](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), [polysorbate 40](/e434-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monopalmitate), [polysorbate 60](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate), [polysorbate 65](/e436-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-tristearate)
- Sugar-based emulsifiers: [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Lactylates for doughs and whipped systems: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Hydrocolloids for thickness and stability: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), or [cellulose](/e460-cellulose)

## How is E430 made?
E430 is a defined mixture of mono- and di-esters formed from food-grade stearic acid and polyoxyethylene glycols (a type of polyethylene glycol), producing an average of eight oxyethylene units per molecule.[^1] Its composition and purity, including limits on by-products, are set in the EU food additive specifications.[^1]

## Is E430 safe to eat?
Food additives must pass safety assessments before approval. In the European Union, E430 is listed with identity and purity criteria, and its use is permitted only in specified foods and at set levels, reflecting a risk assessment and regulatory oversight.[^2] As with any emulsifier, manufacturers use the minimum amount needed to achieve the desired technical effect.

## Does E430 have any benefits?
- For food quality: Helps keep sauces uniform, improves smoothness in desserts and mixes, and supports stable foams.
- For shelf life: Reduces separation and changes in texture during storage.
- For manufacturing: Aids mixing and makes products more consistent from batch to batch.

## Who should avoid E430?
- People with a known allergy or medical sensitivity to polyethylene glycols (PEGs) should ask a healthcare professional about PEG-based emulsifiers such as PEG stearates.
- Those following strict vegetarian or vegan diets may wish to check the source of the stearic acid (it can be from plant or animal fats). Manufacturers can clarify the origin upon request.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E430 is just plastic in food.” Fact: E430 is a surfactant made by attaching short polyoxyethylene chains to stearic acid; it is defined and regulated as a food emulsifier, not as solid plastic.[^1]
- Myth: “If it’s approved, companies can use as much as they want.” Fact: In the EU, additives like E430 can be used only in specified food categories and within legal limits or good manufacturing practice, whichever applies.[^2]

## E430 in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E430,” “polyoxyethylene (8) stearate,” “polyethylene glycol (PEG-8) stearate,” or “PEG-8 stearate.” Placement is usually near other emulsifiers and stabilizers. If the source (plant vs animal) matters to you, contact the brand for details.
