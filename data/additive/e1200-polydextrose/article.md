Polydextrose (E1200) is a man‑made, soluble fiber used to add bulk, body, and moisture to foods with little sweetness or calories. It helps sugar‑reduced foods feel and taste more like their full‑sugar versions and is commonly used as a humectant, stabiliser, and thickener. It is approved in many countries and is generally well tolerated, though large amounts may cause gas or bloating in some people.

## At a glance
- Name and code: Polydextrose — E1200
- What it does: Adds bulk and body, holds moisture, and stabilises texture in low‑sugar and reduced‑calorie foods
- Where you’ll see it: Bars, baked goods, desserts, beverages, confectionery, yogurt, and meal replacements
- Taste and calories: Not very sweet; contributes few calories
- Safety: Approved for use in the U.S. and EU; high intakes may cause digestive discomfort in some people

## Why is Polydextrose added to food?
Polydextrose adds bulk, body, and mouthfeel that would normally come from sugar or fat. It helps keep baked goods moist, gives creaminess to dairy desserts and beverages, and stabilises texture during shelf life. Because it contributes few calories per gram, it is useful in reduced‑calorie and reduced‑sugar recipes.[^1]

## What foods contain Polydextrose?
You can find polydextrose in many everyday items, especially those positioned as “reduced sugar” or “high fiber,” such as:
- Breakfast cereals and granola clusters
- Breads, muffins, cookies, and other baked goods
- Dairy desserts and yogurts
- Protein and snack bars
- Sugar‑free or reduced‑sugar confectionery
- Beverage mixes and ready‑to‑drink shakes
- Tabletop sweetener blends and powdered drink mixes

On ingredient lists it may appear as “polydextrose” or “E1200.”

## What can replace Polydextrose?
Depending on the job polydextrose is doing (bulk, fiber, moisture, or texture), formulators might use:
- Other soluble fibers and bulking agents: [dextrin](/e1400-dextrin), [cellulose](/e460-cellulose)
- Hydrocolloids to add viscosity: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)
- Humectants for moisture: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol)
- Bulk sweeteners in sugar‑reduced foods: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [maltitol](/e965-maltitol), [polyglycitol syrup](/e964-polyglycitol-syrup)
- High‑intensity sweeteners for sweetness (with another bulking agent): [sucralose](/e955-sucralose), [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k)

No single ingredient is a perfect swap; blends are often used to match both texture and taste.

## How is Polydextrose made?
Polydextrose is produced by heating and polymerising dextrose (D‑glucose) in the presence of a small amount of sorbitol and a food‑grade acid catalyst such as citric acid. This process forms a randomly bonded glucose polymer that is mostly non‑digestible, with sorbitol and acid residues incorporated into the structure.[^1]

## Is Polydextrose safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits polydextrose for direct addition to food and sets specifications for its identity and manufacture.[^1] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated polydextrose (E1200) and concluded it is not of safety concern at reported uses and levels.[^2]

Like many fibers and sugar‑reduction ingredients, large intakes can lead to gastrointestinal effects such as gas or loose stools in some people, especially when consumed quickly or without adaptation.[^2]

## Does Polydextrose have any benefits?
Polydextrose is recognised by the FDA as a dietary fiber for labeling because it has demonstrated beneficial physiological effects, such as helping normal laxation, when consumed as part of the diet.[^3] In recipes, it can help reduce sugar and energy while preserving texture and mouthfeel, which is valuable for calorie‑ and sugar‑reduced products.

## Who should avoid Polydextrose?
Most people can enjoy foods containing polydextrose. However:
- Individuals who are sensitive to fiber or who experience gas or bloating with rapid increases in fiber intake may need to introduce it gradually.[^2]
- People with specific gastrointestinal conditions should follow their healthcare professional’s advice on total fiber intake.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s an artificial sweetener.” Fact: Polydextrose is not a high‑intensity sweetener and has little sweetness.
- “It’s just sugar.” Fact: It is a largely non‑digestible glucose polymer that behaves like soluble fiber in foods.
- “It always causes a laxative effect.” Fact: Typical amounts in foods are well tolerated by most people; discomfort is more likely with very high intakes.

## Polydextrose in branded foods
Polydextrose shows up in many mainstream products. You’ll often see it in protein bars and meal‑replacement shakes for added fiber and texture, in reduced‑sugar cookies and cakes to retain moisture, and in yogurts and dairy desserts to provide creaminess. On labels, look for “polydextrose,” “E1200,” or both.
