D-sorbitol (E420i) is a sugar alcohol used to sweeten, thicken, and keep foods moist. It tastes milder than table sugar and helps products stay soft and fresh for longer.

## At a glance
D-sorbitol is a versatile sweetener and moisture keeper used in many sugar-free and reduced-sugar foods.

- What it is: A sugar alcohol (also called a polyol); synonyms include D-sorbitol and D-glucitol
- E-number: E420i (solid form); a related liquid form is often sold as sorbitol solution
- Main roles: Sweetener, humectant (holds water), bulking agent/thickener, stabiliser
- Typical taste: Less sweet than table sugar
- Where it occurs: Found naturally in some fruits (like apples, pears, and stone fruits)
- Common in: Sugar-free gum, candies, baked goods, fillings, jams, frozen desserts, and special-diet foods

## Why is D-sorbitol added to food?
Food makers use D-sorbitol because it sweetens with a mild taste, keeps foods moist, and improves texture. It helps chewy candies stay soft, prevents sugar from crystallising, and can lower the freezing point in frozen treats to keep them scoopable. It also adds bulk in sugar-free recipes so the food still feels right when you eat it.

## What foods contain D-sorbitol?
You will often see D-sorbitol in sugar-free or reduced-sugar items.

- Sugar-free chewing gums and mints
- Candies, fondants, and soft-center chocolates
- Baked goods, cookies, and cake fillings
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Frozen desserts and “no added sugar” treats
- Toothpaste and mouthwash (non-food use)

In the European Union (EU), certain foods that contain added polyols (sugar alcohols) must carry the statement “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects.”[^1]

## What can replace D-sorbitol?
Depending on why it is used (sweetness, bulk, or moisture), common swaps include:
- Other polyol sweeteners: [xylitol](/e967-xylitol){.additive}, [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}, [isomalt](/e953-isomalt){.additive}, [maltitol](/e965-maltitol){.additive}, [lactitol](/e966-lactitol){.additive}
- High-intensity sweeteners (for sweetness only, no bulk): [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}, [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}, [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}
- Humectants/bulking agents: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol){.additive}, [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive} for texture support

## How is D-sorbitol made?
Commercial D-sorbitol is made by catalytic hydrogenation of D-glucose (dextrose), usually obtained from starch hydrolysates such as corn or wheat. Sorbitol may be sold as a concentrated aqueous solution or further processed and crystallised into a solid form.[^2]

## Is D-sorbitol safe to eat?
Regulators in both the United States and the EU allow sorbitol for use in foods, and U.S. regulations define identity and purity for food-grade sorbitol and sorbitol solution.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has re-evaluated sorbitol (E 420) and found no safety concern at current use levels; an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^3]

Like other sugar alcohols, large amounts can cause gas, bloating, and diarrhea because sorbitol is only partly absorbed in the small intestine. Children may be more sensitive to these effects than adults.[^3]

## Does D-sorbitol have any benefits?
- Dental: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows a health claim that sugar-free foods sweetened with certain sugar alcohols, including sorbitol, may reduce the risk of dental caries (tooth decay) when used to replace sugars.[^4]
- Calories: For nutrition labeling in the EU, polyols, including sorbitol, are assigned 10 kJ/g (2.4 kcal/g), which is lower than sugar.[^1]
- Moisture and texture: As a humectant, sorbitol helps baked goods stay soft and prevents drying in confections and fillings.

## Who should avoid D-sorbitol?
- People with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must avoid sorbitol because the body converts sorbitol to fructose.[^5]
- Anyone who experiences digestive upset from polyols should limit intake; sensitive individuals and young children may react at lower amounts.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sorbitol is “artificial” and only made in factories. Fact: Sorbitol occurs naturally in several fruits; the food-grade version is highly purified for consistent quality.
- Myth: Sorbitol always causes stomach problems. Fact: Tolerance varies by person and portion size; many people can enjoy small amounts without issues.
- Myth: Sorbitol sweetens as much as sugar. Fact: Sorbitol is less sweet than table sugar, so recipes often combine it with other sweeteners.

## D-sorbitol in branded foods
You’re most likely to see D-sorbitol on ingredient lists for sugar-free gums, mints, candies, “no added sugar” chocolates, cookies, and ice creams. Look for “sorbitol,” “D-glucitol,” or “E 420/E420i” on the label. In the EU, some products with added polyols will also include the note about possible laxative effects.
