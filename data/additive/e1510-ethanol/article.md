E1510, better known as ethanol or ethyl alcohol, is the same alcohol found in drinks, but in foods it is mainly used as a solvent and carrier for flavors, colors, and plant extracts. It helps dissolve aroma compounds that water cannot, and a small amount may remain in the final product after processing or cooking.

## At a glance
- What it is: Food-grade ethanol (ethyl alcohol), a clear, volatile liquid used as a processing aid and flavor solvent.
- What it does: Dissolves and carries flavor and color compounds; can help control microbes in some formulas.
- Where it’s found: Flavor extracts (like vanilla), tinctures, certain sprays and coatings, and some confectionery.
- Common names on labels: Ethanol, ethyl alcohol, alcohol.
- Regulatory snapshot: Approved for use in food in the U.S. and EU; in the EU it appears as E1510.
- Safety note: Intoxicating in large amounts; vulnerable groups such as people who are pregnant should avoid alcohol.

## Why is Ethanol added to food?
Manufacturers use ethanol because it dissolves many flavor and color molecules that do not mix well with water, then carries those compounds evenly through a food or drink. Vanilla extract is a classic example: by U.S. standard of identity, it must be made with alcohol (at least 35 percent by volume).[^1] Ethanol is also an approved “extraction solvent” in the European Union, meaning it can be used to pull desirable components from plant materials for use in foods.[^2]

## What foods contain Ethanol?
- Flavor extracts and essences, such as vanilla extract used in baking and desserts.[^1]
- Herbal or spice tinctures used to flavor bitters, sauces, or confectionery.
- Spray-applied flavors or coatings where a fast-evaporating solvent is helpful.
- Some EU products will list ethanol as “E1510,” reflecting its additive designation.[^3]

When used in baked goods, much of the ethanol from extracts evaporates during heating, though traces can remain depending on the recipe and process.

## What can replace Ethanol?
Alternatives depend on the job ethanol is doing:
- As a flavor solvent or carrier: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) or [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol) are common stand-ins, though they dissolve a different range of compounds and have a thicker mouthfeel.
- For extraction: [ethyl acetate](/e1504-ethyl-acetate) or supercritical [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) may be used for specific flavors or botanicals.
- For shelf life when ethanol’s mild antimicrobial effect is desired: preservatives such as [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) can be options, depending on pH and product style.

Each substitute has trade-offs in taste, solubility, labeling, and regulations.

## How is Ethanol made?
Food-grade ethanol can be produced by fermenting sugars and starches (for example, from corn or cane) and then purifying it by distillation. It can also be made synthetically (by hydrating ethylene), provided it meets food-grade specifications and good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements.[^4]

## Is Ethanol safe to eat?
In the United States, ethyl alcohol is affirmed as “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice, which limits the amount to what is necessary for its technical effect.[^4] Ethanol is the same alcohol found in beverages, so consuming large amounts can cause intoxication and impairment; foods typically contain much smaller amounts than alcoholic drinks. Public health guidance also advises that no amount of alcohol is known to be safe during pregnancy.[^5]

## Does Ethanol have any benefits?
- Functional: It unlocks flavor compounds that water cannot dissolve and helps spread them evenly in foods and beverages.
- Processing: It evaporates quickly, which is useful for spray-applied flavors and coatings.
- Microbiology: At sufficient levels in certain formulas, ethanol can help limit microbial growth, supporting shelf life alongside other controls.

These are technological benefits; ethanol is not added for nutritional value.

## Who should avoid Ethanol?
- People who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should avoid alcohol exposure due to risks to the fetus.[^5]
- Individuals taking disulfiram (a medicine for alcohol use disorder) must avoid alcohol from all sources, including foods, medicines, and topical products that may contain ethanol.[^6]
- Anyone who needs to avoid alcohol for medical, recovery, religious, or personal reasons should check ingredient lists and speak with a healthcare professional if unsure.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Ethanol in food will make you drunk.” Fact: Foods usually contain very small amounts used as carriers or solvents; levels are far lower than alcoholic drinks, and cooking often reduces them further.
- Myth: “Alcohol-free always means zero ethanol.” Fact: Some “alcohol-free” claims refer to beverages and have legal definitions that can vary by country; always check local rules and labels.
- Myth: “All food ethanol is synthetic.” Fact: Much food-grade ethanol is made by fermentation, the same basic process used for brewing and winemaking.
- Myth: “Methanol and ethanol are the same.” Fact: Methanol is a different, toxic alcohol not permitted as a food additive; ethanol is the approved food-grade alcohol.

## Ethanol in branded foods
On labels, you may see ethanol listed as “ethyl alcohol” or simply “alcohol.” It commonly appears in flavor extracts sold at retail; by U.S. regulation, vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol, which is noted on many brand labels.[^1] In the EU, the same ingredient may appear as “E1510” in ingredient lists.[^3]
