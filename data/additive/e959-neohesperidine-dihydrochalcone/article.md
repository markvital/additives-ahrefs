Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone (NHDC), also called E959, is a high‑intensity sweetener made from a citrus compound found in bitter oranges. It delivers strong sweetness with very few calories and is used in small amounts to sweeten or round off flavor in foods and drinks.

## At a glance
- What it is: a high‑intensity sweetener derived from the citrus flavonoid neohesperidin
- What it does: adds intense sweetness and can help soften bitter or harsh notes
- Where it’s used: low‑ and no‑sugar drinks, sugar‑free confectionery, flavored dairy, chewing gum
- How it appears on labels: “E959” or “neohesperidine dihydrochalcone”
- Regulatory note (EU): authorized as a food additive with defined purity criteria and permitted uses

## Why is Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone added to food?
Food makers use E959 because it is many times sweeter than table sugar, so only tiny amounts are needed to achieve sweetness. That helps reduce sugars and calories while keeping a pleasant taste. In the European Union (EU), E959 is listed in the food additives law as a sweetener, which defines its function in foods.[^1] Its identity and purity requirements are set in a separate EU regulation that lays down detailed specifications for approved additives.[^2]

## What foods contain Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone?
You’ll most often see E959 in products that aim for strong sweetness with little or no sugar. Common examples include:
- Diet or “zero” soft drinks and flavored waters
- Sugar‑free candies and lozenges
- Chewing gum
- Flavored dairy or dessert products

In the EU, the food categories where E959 may be used, along with maximum levels if applicable, are listed in the Union list of authorized food additives.[^3]

## What can replace Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone?
Depending on the recipe and flavor goals, formulators might swap E959 for other high‑intensity sweeteners such as:
- [Sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}
- [Acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}
- [Aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}
- [Steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}
- [Saccharin](/e954-saccharin-and-its-salts){.additive}
- [Neotame](/e961-neotame){.additive} or [Advantame](/e969-advantame){.additive}

For bulk and mouthfeel, sugar alcohols like [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}, [xylitol](/e967-xylitol){.additive}, or [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive} can also be used, sometimes alongside a high‑intensity sweetener.

## How is Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone made?
NHDC is made from neohesperidin, a naturally occurring citrus flavonoid found in bitter orange and related fruits. Through chemical steps, the molecule is converted to a “dihydrochalcone,” purified, and crystallized for food use. In the EU, the final food‑grade material must meet the official specification for E959.[^2] Chemically, NHDC is the dihydrochalcone derivative of neohesperidin, which is why it carries that name.[^4]

## Is Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone safe to eat?
Within the EU, a food additive can only be used after a safety evaluation and authorization. E959 is authorized as a sweetener and may be added only to the foods and at the levels set by EU law.[^1] Products sold in the EU must also meet the EU purity criteria for E959, which include identity tests and limits for impurities.[^2] Always follow storage and use instructions on the finished food, especially for products formulated for special diets.

## Does Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone have any benefits?
- Strong sweetness at very low levels, which helps reduce sugars and calories
- A sweetness profile that can soften bitterness in some formulations
- Useful in blends with other sweeteners to fine‑tune taste and aftertaste

These are formulation benefits; they do not imply any medical or health effects.

## Who should avoid Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone?
- People who prefer to avoid high‑intensity sweeteners for personal or dietary reasons
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit specific sweeteners
If you have questions about whether a product fits your diet, check the ingredient list for “E959” or “neohesperidine dihydrochalcone” and speak with a qualified professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E959 is just sugar in disguise.”  
  Fact: NHDC is a distinct, high‑intensity sweetener used in tiny amounts and is not the same as sucrose (table sugar).
- Myth: “All high‑intensity sweeteners are the same.”  
  Fact: Each sweetener has its own taste profile, stability, and allowed uses. E959 is different from [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}, [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, or [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}.
- Myth: “If it’s in the ingredient list, it must be added in large amounts.”  
  Fact: Because E959 is very potent, it is used at very low levels compared with sugar.

## Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone in branded foods
On EU labels, look for “E959” or “neohesperidine dihydrochalcone.” You’re most likely to find it in diet soft drinks, sugar‑free confectionery and chewing gum, and flavored dairy desserts. Many products use it in combination with other sweeteners to shape the overall taste.
