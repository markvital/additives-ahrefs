## At a glance

- What it is: a synthetic brown azo dye used as a color
- Also called: Chocolate Brown HT, E155
- Why it’s used: to give or deepen chocolate‑like and other brown tones
- Where it shows up: flavored coatings, bakery icings, desserts, and drink powders
- Regulatory status: specified and regulated in the EU; not permitted for use in foods in the U.S.
- On labels: “E155,” “Brown HT,” or “Chocolate Brown HT”

## Why is Brown ht added to food?

Food makers use Brown HT to deliver a consistent brown shade when natural colors or cocoa alone cannot achieve the exact tone. It helps standardize appearance from batch to batch, which is important for brand consistency and consumer expectations.

## What foods contain Brown ht?

You might find Brown HT in:
- Chocolate‑flavored frostings, glazes, and coatings
- Dessert mixes and puddings
- Powdered drink mixes and syrups
- Candies and confectionery
- Savory sauces or seasonings that need a dark brown hue

Always check the ingredient list. In regions where it is allowed, it may appear as “Brown HT,” “Chocolate Brown HT,” or “E155.” In the U.S., this color is not approved for foods, so properly marketed domestic products should not list it.[^1]

## What can replace Brown ht?

Depending on the food and the exact shade, manufacturers may use:
- Caramel colors such as [caramel](/e150-caramel) (various E150 classes)
- Cocoa powder (for both flavor and color)
- Blends of permitted colors to create brown tones, for example [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red) with [Tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) or small amounts of [Brilliant Blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf), adjusted to the desired shade
- In some recipes, natural color sources (like roasted malt extracts) can contribute brown color

## How is Brown ht made?

Brown HT is produced by chemical synthesis. It belongs to the azo dye family, meaning its color comes from one or more azo (–N=N–) linkages connecting aromatic rings. Commercial material is supplied in sodium salt forms and must meet identity and purity specifications where it is authorized for use, such as those laid down by the European Union.[^2]

## Is Brown ht safe to eat?

Safety depends on jurisdiction and the conditions of use:
- European Union: Brown HT (E155) appears in the EU’s additives framework, which sets out purity specifications and lays the groundwork for permitted uses and levels in certain foods. Products must meet these rules to be placed on the market.[^2][^3]
- United States: Chocolate Brown HT (Brown HT) is not an approved color additive for foods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) flags it among colors that render foods adulterated if used in U.S. commerce. Imports containing this dye are subject to detention.[^1]

If you are unsure about local rules, check your national food authority’s guidance.

## Does Brown ht have any benefits?

- Color consistency: It helps deliver a uniform brown shade across batches.
- Formulation flexibility: It can be used in very small amounts to fine‑tune color without changing flavor or texture.
These are technological benefits; they do not imply nutritional value.

## Who should avoid Brown ht?

- Consumers in the U.S., where Brown HT is not permitted in foods[^1]
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic azo colors for personal or dietary reasons
- Anyone with a diagnosed sensitivity to this specific colorant should follow medical advice

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “Brown HT is the same as caramel color.”  
  Fact: Caramel colors are produced by heating sugars (E150 series). Brown HT is a synthetic azo dye; they are different additives with different specifications.[^2]

- Myth: “If it’s allowed somewhere, it must be allowed everywhere.”  
  Fact: Color additive approvals vary by country. Brown HT is not approved for food use in the U.S., even though it appears in EU specifications.[^1][^2]

- Myth: “Brown HT means the food tastes like chocolate.”  
  Fact: The name “Chocolate Brown HT” refers to the shade, not flavor. It does not add chocolate taste.

## Brown ht in branded foods

To see if a product uses Brown HT:
- Read the ingredient list for “E155,” “Brown HT,” or “Chocolate Brown HT.”
- Check the country of sale and manufacturer. Products intended for markets where Brown HT is not permitted (like the U.S.) should not list it.[^1]
- When in doubt, contact the brand’s consumer relations department for clarification.
