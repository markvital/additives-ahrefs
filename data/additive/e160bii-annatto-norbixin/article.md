Annatto norbixin (E160b(ii)) is a yellow–orange food color made from the seeds of the achiote tree (Bixa orellana). It is the water‑dispersible form of annatto color and is widely used to give dairy, snacks, and baked goods a warm hue.

## At a glance
- What it is: A plant-derived color from annatto seeds, in the water-dispersible “norbixin” form.
- E-number: E160b(ii); related to the oil‑soluble annatto form called [annatto bixin](/e160bi-annatto-bixin){.additive}.
- What it does: Colors foods from yellow to orange; useful where water-based colors are needed.
- Seen on labels as: Annatto, annatto extract, norbixin, color: E160b.
- Typical foods: Cheeses (like cheddar-style), dairy spreads, sauces, snacks, and baked goods.
- Regulatory status: Approved color additive in the EU and U.S. when used as directed.

## Why is Annatto norbixin added to food?
Manufacturers use annatto norbixin to give foods a consistent yellow to orange color that holds up in water‑based systems. Norbixin is the water‑dispersible counterpart to oil‑soluble bixin, so it mixes well into low‑fat or aqueous foods like cheeses, sauces, and drinks.[^3]

## What foods contain Annatto norbixin?
You’ll most often see it in dairy and cheese products, processed cheeses, flavored spreads, sauces, soups, snacks, and bakery items. Exposure assessments in Europe list annatto extracts among colors used across several food categories, with norbixin favored where water dispersion is needed.[^2]

## What can replace Annatto norbixin?
Depending on the shade and recipe, common swaps include:
- [Beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene){.additive} for yellow–orange tones
- [Paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive} for orange–red notes
- [Curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive} for bright yellow
- [Riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin){.additive} for yellow in some applications
- [Caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive} for brown to amber shades

Color choice depends on solubility (water vs. oil), pH stability, light stability, and flavor impact.

## How is Annatto norbixin made?
Annatto seeds naturally contain bixin, an oil‑soluble carotenoid. To make norbixin, producers extract annatto in alkaline solution, which saponifies (chemically converts) bixin into norbixin, a dicarboxylic acid that can be used as its sodium or potassium salts for water dispersion. The extract is then filtered, standardized, and adjusted to meet purity and performance specifications.[^3]

## Is Annatto norbixin safe to eat?
Regulators have evaluated annatto extracts, including norbixin. In the EU, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for norbixin, based on toxicology data.[^2] In the U.S., annatto extract (which contains bixin and norbixin) is an FDA‑permitted color additive exempt from certification for coloring foods in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## Does Annatto norbixin have any benefits?
This additive does not add nutrition, but it offers practical benefits:
- Plant-derived color with a familiar label name.
- Good dispersion in water‑based and low‑fat foods.
- Heat and pH performance suitable for many processed foods.

## Who should avoid Annatto norbixin?
- If your healthcare provider advises avoiding color additives, or you follow a dye‑elimination diet, you may choose products without annatto.
- If you have a confirmed sensitivity to annatto colors, avoid foods listing annatto, norbixin, bixin, or E160b on the label.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: All E‑numbers are artificial. Fact: Many, including E160b annatto, come from natural sources.
- Myth: Norbixin and bixin are the same. Fact: They are related annatto pigments; norbixin is water‑dispersible, while bixin is oil‑soluble.
- Myth: Annatto makes foods red. Fact: Norbixin gives yellow to orange hues.
- Myth: Annatto colors are banned in the U.S. Fact: Annatto extract is permitted by the FDA for coloring foods.[^1]

## Annatto norbixin in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “annatto,” “annatto extract,” “norbixin,” or “color: E160b.” In the EU, the E‑number may appear as E160b; in the U.S., the common name “annatto (for color)” is typical. You’ll often find it in cheddar‑style cheeses, processed cheeses, spreads, snacks, and sauces.
