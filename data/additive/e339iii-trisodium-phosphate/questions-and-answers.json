      "q": "is trisodium phosphate in cereal bad for you",
      "a": "The small amounts used in cereal are within regulatory limits and not considered harmful for the general population; the main concern is overall phosphorus and sodium intake. Those with kidney disease or on phosphate‑restricted diets should limit added phosphate sources.",
