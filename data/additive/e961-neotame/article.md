Neotame (E961) is a very strong, zero-calorie sweetener used at tiny amounts to sweeten foods and drinks. It also works as a flavor enhancer and stays sweet during cooking and baking. It’s approved for use in many countries, including the U.S. and the EU.

## At a glance
- Function: high‑intensity sweetener; also used as a flavor enhancer
- Sweetness: thousands of times sweeter than table sugar (sucrose), so only trace amounts are needed
- Heat and pH: designed to be more stable than some other sweeteners during cooking and over shelf life
- Calories and carbs: effectively none at typical use levels
- Label names: “neotame” or “E961” (in the EU)
- Regulators: evaluated and authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union

## Why is Neotame added to food?
Food makers use neotame because it delivers intense sweetness without adding sugar or calories, and it keeps its sweetness through processing and storage better than several older sweeteners.[^3] It can also be used as a flavor enhancer to round out or improve taste in certain recipes.[^2]

## What foods contain Neotame?
You may find neotame in:
- Sugar‑free or reduced‑sugar soft drinks, flavored waters, and powdered drink mixes
- Chewing gum, candies, and mints
- Baked goods, breakfast cereals, and snack bars
- Dairy desserts and yogurts
- Tabletop sweetener packets or drops

Ingredient lists usually show it as “neotame”; in the EU it may appear as “E961.”

## What can replace Neotame?
Depending on the recipe and label goals, manufacturers might swap neotame for:
- Other high‑intensity sweeteners: [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}, [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}, [saccharin](/e954-saccharin-and-its-salts){.additive}, [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}, or [advantame](/e969-advantame){.additive}
- Sugar alcohols (polyols) that add bulk and some sweetness: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}, [xylitol](/e967-xylitol){.additive}, [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive}, [isomalt](/e953-isomalt){.additive}, or [maltitol](/e965-maltitol){.additive}

Each option has its own taste, stability, and labeling profile, so blends are common.

## How is Neotame made?
Neotame is made by chemical synthesis. Its formal name is N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, and it must meet identity and purity specifications set in U.S. regulations and be used under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).[^2]

## Is Neotame safe to eat?
Yes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed neotame’s safety, set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and notes it is safe for people with phenylketonuria (PKU).[^1] In the European Union, neotame is authorized as food additive E 961 and listed in the EU’s additive specifications.[^4]

ADI means the amount you can consume every day over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. Typical diets stay far below this level because neotame is used in very small amounts.

## Does Neotame have any benefits?
- Lets manufacturers cut added sugars and calories while keeping sweetness
- Works in products that face heat or long storage, such as baked goods or shelf‑stable drinks
- Because only tiny amounts are needed, it doesn’t add bulk or texture—useful when you want sweetness without changing the product’s body

## Who should avoid Neotame?
Most people do not need to avoid neotame. If you’re following a diet that restricts high‑intensity sweeteners, or if you notice personal sensitivity, choose products without it. People with PKU do not need a phenylalanine warning for neotame‑sweetened products, according to the FDA.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Neotame isn’t allowed in the EU. Fact: It is authorized in the EU as E 961 and included in the official additive specifications.[^4]
- Myth: Neotame breaks down in the oven. Fact: It was developed to be more heat‑stable than some earlier sweeteners and can be used in cooking and baking.[^3]
- Myth: People with PKU must avoid neotame. Fact: FDA states neotame is safe for people with PKU and does not require the phenylalanine warning used for some other sweeteners.[^1]

## Neotame in branded foods
To spot neotame, check the ingredient list for “neotame.” In the EU, you may also see “E961.” It often appears alongside other sweeteners to balance taste. Categories where you might see it include diet soft drinks, sugar‑free gum, light yogurts, and reduced‑sugar baked snacks.
