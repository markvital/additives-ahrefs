Sodium sulphate (E514i) is an inorganic salt used mainly as a processing aid during food manufacturing. It is approved in the European Union and recognized as safe in the United States when used under good manufacturing practice. It rarely appears on retail labels and does not add flavor or nutrition.

## At a glance
- E-number: E514i; also written as sodium sulfate (US spelling).
- What it does: Used primarily as a processing aid; it does not contribute taste or color.
- Where it shows up: More common in factory processing steps than in finished, packaged foods.
- Safety: Authorized in the EU and considered GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the U.S. FDA when used as intended.

## Why is Sodium sulphate added to food?
Food makers use sodium sulphate as a processing aid. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium sulfate as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for direct use in food when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, it is listed as a food additive (E 514) with defined identity and purity specifications.[^2]

## What foods contain Sodium sulphate?
You are unlikely to see sodium sulphate in everyday ingredient lists. When it is present and must be declared, it will typically appear as “sodium sulphate,” “sodium sulfate,” or “E514.”

## What can replace Sodium sulphate?
Alternatives depend on why a manufacturer uses it:
- For acidity or buffering needs: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid).
- For texture or firmness in certain applications: [calcium sulphate](/e516-calcium-sulphate).
- For anti-caking or flow improvement in powders: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) or [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate).

## How is Sodium sulphate made?
Food-grade sodium sulphate can be produced by neutralizing [sulphuric acid](/e513-sulphuric-acid) with sodium bases such as [sodium carbonate](/e500-sodium-carbonates) or [sodium hydroxide](/e524-sodium-hydroxide), followed by purification and drying.[^1] The additive must meet the identity and purity specifications set out in the EU food additives regulation.[^2] Chemically, sodium sulphate is Na2SO4 and may be used in anhydrous form or as a hydrate (for example, the decahydrate is historically known as “Glauber’s salt”).[^5]

## Is Sodium sulphate safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the U.S., sodium sulfate is GRAS for direct addition to food under good manufacturing practice.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated sulfates (including E 514) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels; an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^3] Like other sulfate salts, very high intakes can have a laxative effect due to osmotic action, which is not relevant at typical food-use levels.[^3]

## Does Sodium sulphate have any benefits?
For consumers, sodium sulphate does not provide flavor, aroma, or nutrition. Its value is mainly technological: it helps manufacturers during processing so the final product is consistent.

## Who should avoid Sodium sulphate?
- People who notice digestive upset from sulfate salts should avoid large supplemental intakes; this effect is most often seen at amounts far above normal food-use levels.[^3]
- Those on sodium-restricted diets should consider total sodium from all sources, even though sodium sulphate is not a major source in most diets.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Sodium sulphate is the same as table salt. Fact: Table salt is sodium chloride; sodium sulphate is a different compound.
- Myth: It adds sweetness or flavor. Fact: It is essentially tasteless in typical use and is added for processing needs.
- Myth: It is banned in the EU. Fact: It is listed as E 514 with official specifications in the EU.

## Sodium sulphate in branded foods
- Label names you might see: “sodium sulphate,” “sodium sulfate,” “E514,” or “E514i.”
- Appearance on retail labels is uncommon; it is more often used in manufacturing steps where it may not remain in the finished food.
