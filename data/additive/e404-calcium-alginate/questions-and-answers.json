      "q": "how to apply calcium alginate dressing",
      "a": "Cleanse the wound, dry the surrounding skin, then lay or lightly pack the calcium alginate (sheet or rope) to cover/fill the wound without overpacking and cover with an appropriate secondary dressing; it will gel on contact with exudate and lifts out with gentle irrigation at change. Use it on moderate-to-heavily exuding wounds (not dry wounds) and follow product instructions or clinician guidance.",

      "q": "is calcium alginate and aquacel ag the same thing",
      "a": "No. Aquacel Ag is a hydrofiber (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) dressing with ionic silver, while calcium alginate is an alginate fiber dressing without silver unless specified; both gel and absorb exudate, but Aquacel Ag adds antimicrobial action.",

      "q": "is aquacel ag the same as calcium alginate",
      "a": "No—Aquacel Ag is carboxymethylcellulose with silver, whereas calcium alginate is alginate fiber; they’re different materials even though both form a gel and manage exudate. Aquacel Ag provides antimicrobial silver, which standard calcium alginate does not.",

      "q": "what does calcium alginate do for wounds",
      "a": "It absorbs moderate-to-heavy exudate and turns into a soft gel that maintains a moist healing environment while helping protect surrounding skin. Its calcium ions can also help support hemostasis in lightly bleeding wounds.",

    {
      "q": "how often to change calcium alginate dressing",
      "a": "Typically every 1–3 days, or sooner if the secondary dressing becomes saturated; frequency depends on exudate level and wound condition. Always follow the specific product directions or a clinician’s advice.",
