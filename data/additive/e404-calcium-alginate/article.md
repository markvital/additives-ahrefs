Calcium alginate (E404) is a gel-forming ingredient made from brown seaweed. It thickens, stabilizes, and holds water in many foods, from fruit fillings to dairy desserts. Safety reviews in the EU and globally find no concern at the levels used in food.

## At a glance
- What it is: the calcium salt of seaweed-derived alginic acid (E404); a thickener, stabiliser, and gelling agent.
- Where it’s used: sauces, jams and fruit fillings, bakery creams, dairy desserts, restructured foods, and modern “spherification.”
- How it works: calcium ions link alginate chains to form firm, heat-stable gels and to trap water.
- Label names: “calcium alginate,” “E404.”
- Diet and allergens: made from seaweed; typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans; not known as a common allergen.

## Why is Calcium alginate added to food?
Food makers use calcium alginate to build and hold texture. It can form firm, heat-stable gels, thicken liquids, reduce syneresis (weeping), and keep particles suspended. These functions help stabilize sauces, shape restructured foods, and give desserts a clean cut. It is authorized in the EU as a thickener, stabiliser, carrier, humectant, and sequestrant for various food categories.[^2]

## What foods contain Calcium alginate?
You may find E404 in:
- Fruit preps and fillings (to hold shape and reduce weeping)
- Dairy desserts and ice cream ripples
- Bakery creams and glazes
- Savory sauces, dressings, and marinades
- Reformed or shaped products (for example, olive “pearls” made by spherification)
- Plant-based products and meat or fish analogs

On labels, look for “calcium alginate” or “E404.” Related seaweed gums sometimes appear alongside it, such as [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate), [alginic acid](/e400-alginic-acid), or [potassium alginate](/e402-potassium-alginate).

## What can replace Calcium alginate?
Alternatives depend on the job:
- For thickening and suspension: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- For firm gels: [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), [agar](/e406-agar), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- For jam-like set with fruit acid/sugar: [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- For alginate-like systems that gel with calcium: [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate) combined with a calcium source such as [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride)

## How is Calcium alginate made?
Manufacturers extract alginic acid from brown seaweeds, purify it, and then neutralize it with a calcium source to form calcium alginate. After washing and drying, the product meets purity and composition limits set in EU additive specifications.[^1] Calcium ions link blocks within the alginate chains, creating strong gels that are central to its food uses.[^3]

## Is Calcium alginate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated alginic acid and its salts (E400–E404) and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels in food.[^2] The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assigned alginic acid and its salts an “ADI not specified,” meaning their use at levels needed for food technology is not considered a health risk.[^3] Alginates are not appreciably absorbed or metabolized; very high intakes may cause mild gastrointestinal effects in some people.[^3]

## Does Calcium alginate have any benefits?
- Technical: builds body, forms clean-cut gels, and prevents weeping in fillings and gels.
- Processing: helps shape or bind restructured foods and keeps particles evenly mixed.
- Culinary: enables “cold-set” gels and spherification without heating.
- Formulation: adds texture without adding sugar or fat.

## Who should avoid Calcium alginate?
- Young children should not consume “jelly mini-cups” containing certain gelling agents, including alginates, due to choking risk; the EU prohibits their use in that product format.[^4]
- Individuals who notice digestive sensitivity to hydrocolloids may wish to moderate intake, as large amounts can cause gas or loose stools.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Calcium alginate is synthetic.” Fact: It is derived from brown seaweed and then converted to a calcium salt.
- Myth: “It adds lots of calcium to your diet.” Fact: It is used in tiny amounts for texture, not as a mineral supplement.
- Myth: “All seaweed gums work the same.” Fact: Alginates gel with calcium; others like [agar](/e406-agar) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) set in different ways and at different conditions.
- Myth: “It’s the same as konjac.” Fact: [Konjac](/e425-konjac) is a different fiber (glucomannan) with different gel behavior.

## Calcium alginate in branded foods
You’ll most often see E404 in ingredient lists for fruit fillings, spoonable desserts, sauces, and some plant-based or restructured products. If you are checking a product, look for “Calcium alginate” or “E404” on the label, sometimes alongside related alginates like [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate).
