Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids (E477) are emulsifiers that help oil and water mix and stay mixed. Often called propylene glycol esters of fatty acids, they are used to make foods smoother, creamier, and more stable during storage. You’ll most often see E477 in baked goods, spreads, and frozen desserts.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made by joining propylene glycol with edible fatty acids
- What it does: Helps oil and water blend, stabilizes foams, and improves texture
- Common in: Bread and cakes, margarines and spreads, whipped toppings, coffee whiteners, and ice cream
- Other names: Propylene glycol esters of fatty acids; PGEs; E477
- Dietary notes: Fatty acids can come from vegetable or animal fats; check with the maker if you need vegetarian/vegan assurance
- Regulatory status: Permitted in both the U.S. and EU within set conditions

## Why is Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids added to food?
E477 is added because it acts like a bridge between oil and water. It reduces surface tension so ingredients blend evenly, and it helps keep air bubbles and fat droplets stable during mixing and storage. That makes baked goods softer, whipped toppings hold their shape, and frozen desserts feel creamy rather than icy.

## What foods contain Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids?
You’ll most often find E477 in:
- Bread, rolls, cake mixes, and pastries
- Margarines, spreads, and shortenings
- Whipped toppings and coffee whiteners
- Ice cream and other frozen desserts

In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits propylene glycol mono- and diesters of fats and fatty acids for direct addition to food under specified conditions.[^1] In the European Union (EU), E477 is on the Union list of approved food additives and may be used according to category rules.[^2]

On labels, look for “E477” or “propylene glycol esters of fatty acids.”

## What can replace Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe and the job the emulsifier must do:
- Other emulsifiers: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}, [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}, [DATEM](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [lactic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}
- Texture stabilizers and gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [cellulose derivatives](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose){.additive}
- Process tweaks: changing mixing speed, fat type, or cooling steps

## How is Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids made?
E477 is produced by reacting propane-1,2-diol (propylene glycol) with edible fatty acids from approved sources. The result is mainly mono- and di-esters, with small amounts of tri-esters. The fatty acids may come from vegetable, animal, or marine fats and oils, all meeting food-grade standards.[^3]

## Is Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended by law. In the U.S., the FDA lists propylene glycol mono- and diesters of fats and fatty acids as a food additive permitted for direct addition to food under stated conditions.[^1] In the EU, E477 appears on the Union list of approved additives, and detailed purity specifications (such as identity and allowed impurities) are set in a separate regulation.[^2][^3]

These official approvals mean E477 has been reviewed for safety and is acceptable at the levels and in the food categories defined by regulators.

## Does Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids have any benefits?
E477 has technical benefits for food quality:
- Creates a fine, even crumb in baked goods
- Helps spreads and toppings stay uniform
- Improves freeze–thaw stability in frozen desserts
These are processing and texture benefits, not nutrition or health benefits.

## Who should avoid Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids?
- Vegetarians, vegans, and those with religious dietary rules may wish to check the source of the fatty acids. Regulations allow fatty acids from vegetable, animal, or marine origins, so manufacturers should be consulted if the source matters to you.[^3]
- People following a clinician-advised diet that restricts propylene glycol or certain emulsifiers should review labels and seek personalized guidance.

If you have a diagnosed intolerance or allergy and are unsure whether it applies here, consult your healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E477 is just antifreeze.” Fact: E477 is a family of food-grade esters made from propylene glycol and fatty acids, and it is specifically authorized for use in foods by the FDA and the EU within set conditions.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “It must be animal-derived.” Fact: The fatty acids used can come from vegetable, animal, or marine sources; many makers use vegetable oils, but the source can vary.[^3]
- Myth: “If it’s approved, more is always better.” Fact: Approvals come with category rules and specifications; food makers must stay within those limits.[^2][^3]

## Propane-1‚2-diol esters of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E477” or “propylene glycol esters of fatty acids.” Some products may list it along with other emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or [lecithin](/e322-lecithins){.additive}. If you need vegetarian or allergen sourcing details, check the brand’s FAQ or contact the manufacturer.
