Disodium diphosphate (E450i), also called sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), is a phosphate salt used to help foods rise, keep their color, and hold moisture. It is common in baking powders, processed meats, and prepared potato products. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow it in foods when used properly.

## At a glance
- What it is: A phosphate salt in the E450 group; also known as sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP).
- What it does: Leavening acid, pH controller, sequestrant (binds metal ions), stabilizer, and moisture/texture aid.
- Looks like: Fine, white, odorless powder that dissolves in water.
- Where you’ll find it: Baking powders and mixes, self-rising flour, biscuits, donuts, tortillas, processed meat and seafood, and prepared potatoes.
- Paired with: Often used with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive} in baking systems.
- Regulatory status: Allowed in the U.S. and EU under good manufacturing practice with specifications set for identity and purity.[^1][^2]

## Why is Disodium diphosphate added to food?
Food makers use disodium diphosphate as a leavening acid. When mixed with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive}, it releases carbon dioxide to make doughs and batters rise evenly. It also binds trace metals (like iron and copper) that can drive off-flavors and discoloration, helps control pH, and supports texture and moisture in finished foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Disodium diphosphate?
You are most likely to see it in:
- Baking powders, cake and pancake mixes, self-rising flour, biscuits, donuts, waffles, and tortillas
- Prepared potato items such as hash browns, fries, and dehydrated potatoes
- Processed meat and poultry products (for yield and moisture), and some seafood
- Canned or retorted foods where color and texture need stability

On labels, look for “sodium acid pyrophosphate,” “SAPP,” “disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate,” or “E450i.”

## What can replace Disodium diphosphate?
Possible alternatives depend on the job it does:
- For leavening acid in baking: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate){.additive} or [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate){.additive}
- For slow-release leavening or milder acidification: [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone){.additive}
- For acidity control and tart flavor: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid){.additive}
- For sequestration or phosphate systems: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates){.additive}, [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates){.additive}, or [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates){.additive}

Choice depends on desired rise speed, flavor, sodium level, and processing conditions.

## How is Disodium diphosphate made?
Food-grade disodium diphosphate is produced from food-grade phosphoric acid and sodium sources (such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide). The material is then heated to remove water and form the pyrophosphate structure, and it is milled to a controlled particle size. Identity and purity specifications for E450i are laid out in EU additive specifications.[^2]

## Is Disodium diphosphate safe to eat?
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms sodium acid pyrophosphate as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice for its intended technical functions.[^1]
- European Union: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus/kg body weight per day (as total phosphorus from all phosphate additives E 338–341, E 343, E 450–452). Some population groups may approach or exceed this level at high intakes.[^3]

In processed meat and poultry, U.S. rules limit the amount of added phosphates in the finished product (calculated as P2O5) to ensure safe and suitable use.[^4]

## Does Disodium diphosphate have any benefits?
- In baking, it gives reliable, even rising and helps control the timing of gas release for better crumb and volume.
- In potato and other prepared foods, it supports stable color and texture during cooking and holding.
- In meats and seafood, it helps retain moisture and tenderness during processing and heating.[^4]

These are technological benefits; disodium diphosphate is not added for nutrition.

## Who should avoid Disodium diphosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease or those told to limit phosphorus intake should keep an eye on phosphate additives, including E450i.[^3]
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to restrict phosphate or sodium should read labels and choose products accordingly.

## Myths & facts
- “Phosphates are always unsafe.” False. Phosphates, including E450i, are permitted and regulated; safety depends on dose and overall diet.[^1][^3]
- “It’s only a baking powder ingredient.” Not quite. It also helps manage color, pH, and moisture in many processed foods.
- “It adds aluminum.” False. Disodium diphosphate contains sodium and phosphate, not aluminum. Aluminum-based acids are different additives, such as [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate){.additive}.

## Disodium diphosphate in branded foods
You will find disodium diphosphate on many ingredient lists, especially in baking powders, mixes, tortillas, processed meats, and prepared potatoes. On the label it may appear as “sodium acid pyrophosphate,” “SAPP,” or “E450i.” In baking powders, it is commonly paired with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive} as the acid component. If you are limiting phosphate additives, compare similar products and choose versions that use alternatives like [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate){.additive} or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} when suitable.
