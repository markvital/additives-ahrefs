      "q": "how to cook amaranth",
      "a": "E123 amaranth is a synthetic food dye, not the edible grain, so it isn’t cooked; where legal, manufacturers dissolve tiny amounts into foods to add red color. It’s banned in the United States and not intended for home use.",

      "q": "how to eat amaranth",
