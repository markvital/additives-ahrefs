Plain caramel (E150a) is a brown color made by heating sugars. It adds warm amber to deep brown tones to foods and drinks and is the simplest “caramel color,” produced without ammonia or sulfites. It is used widely and is considered safe when used as allowed by regulators.

## At a glance
- What it is: a brown colouring made by heating carbohydrates (sugars)
- E-number: E150a; also called caramel color, plain caramel, caramel coloring
- What it does: gives consistent brown shades in drinks, sauces, and baked foods
- How it’s made: heat treatment of sugars; no ammonium or sulfite compounds
- Typical form: dark brown liquid or powder; water‑soluble
- Flavor impact: very mild at normal use levels
- Related types: [caustic sulphite caramel](/e150b-caustic-sulphite-caramel){.additive}, [ammonia caramel](/e150c-ammonia-caramel){.additive}, [sulphite ammonia caramel](/e150d-sulphite-ammonia-caramel){.additive}

## Why is Plain caramel added to food?
Manufacturers use E150a to give a reliable brown color that looks the same from batch to batch. It helps products keep their expected look over shelf life, even when they are heated, cooled, or stored for a long time.

## What foods contain Plain caramel?
Plain caramel appears across many categories, including soft drinks, brewed beverages, baked goods, breakfast cereals, confectionery, sauces, dressings, and soups. In the United States, caramel color is a color additive “exempt from certification” and may be used in foods in line with good manufacturing practice, which is why you see it in so many products.[^1]

## What can replace Plain caramel?
- Other caramel classes for stronger or different brown tones: [caustic sulphite caramel](/e150b-caustic-sulphite-caramel){.additive}, [ammonia caramel](/e150c-ammonia-caramel){.additive}, or [sulphite ammonia caramel](/e150d-sulphite-ammonia-caramel){.additive}
- Natural orange‑to‑red options when a different hue is acceptable: [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}
- Food ingredients that also add flavor and body: cocoa powder or malt extracts (not always listed as additives)

Each substitute changes hue, transparency, taste, and stability, so developers choose based on the product’s needs.

## How is Plain caramel made?
E150a is made by controlled heating of food‑grade carbohydrates (such as glucose syrup or sucrose). For “plain” caramel, no ammonium or sulfite compounds are used; only acids, alkalis, or salts may be added to guide the process, followed by purification and concentration to a syrup or powder.[^2]

## Is Plain caramel safe to eat?
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated caramel colours and concluded that Plain caramel (Class I, E150a) does not raise a safety concern at reported use levels and set an ADI “not specified,” meaning risk is low when used as intended.[^3] ADI stands for Acceptable Daily Intake. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists caramel as a permitted color additive exempt from certification, allowed in foods under good manufacturing practice, subject to identity and purity specifications.[^1]

## Does Plain caramel have any benefits?
- Gives a stable, uniform brown color that holds up during processing and storage
- Minimal taste at typical levels, so it does not mask the food’s flavor
- Works in water‑based systems (beverages, sauces) and many baked foods

It does not provide nutritional benefits; its role is visual.

## Who should avoid Plain caramel?
Most people do not need to avoid E150a. People who choose to limit color additives for personal reasons may opt out. Those sensitive to sulfites may prefer E150a over sulfite‑processed caramels because Class I (plain) caramel is made without sulfite reagents by specification.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All caramel colors contain 4‑MEI.” Fact: 4‑MEI (4‑methylimidazole) is associated with ammonia‑processed caramels (Classes III and IV). Plain caramel (Class I, E150a) is produced without ammonia.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s just burnt sugar.” Fact: It is a controlled heat process with defined ingredients and purity limits to ensure consistent color and safety.[^2]
- Myth: “Caramel color always adds a roasted flavor.” Fact: At normal use levels, E150a’s flavor impact is low; it mainly changes appearance.

## Plain caramel in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll usually see it as “caramel color,” “plain caramel,” or “E150a” (in regions that use E‑numbers). It commonly appears in colas and other soft drinks, some beers and ciders, brown sauces and gravies, cereals, baked goods, and candies.
