Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids (E470a) are food-grade “soap-like” compounds made by combining common fatty acids with minerals. They help oil and water mix, keep powders free‑flowing, and stop foods from sticking to equipment. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow their use within good manufacturing practice.

## At a glance
This additive keeps foods stable and easy to process.

- What it is: Mineral salts of common dietary fatty acids (for example, sodium stearate or calcium stearate)
- What it does: Emulsifier, stabiliser, anti-caking agent, and release agent
- Where it appears: Baked goods, confectionery, powdered mixes, seasonings, and more
- Label names: “E470a,” “calcium stearate,” “sodium stearate,” “potassium stearate,” or “salts of fatty acids”
- Sourcing note: Can be made from vegetable or animal fats; ask the maker if you need a specific source
- Regulatory status: Permitted in the EU and U.S. under established specifications and good manufacturing practice

## Why is Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids added to food?
Manufacturers use E470a to help oil and water blend (emulsify), to stabilise textures during shelf life, to keep powders from clumping (anti‑caking), and to reduce sticking in molds and on processing equipment (release agent). These functions make production more reliable and keep foods consistent from batch to batch.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids?
You may find E470a in a wide range of everyday products. Typical examples include breads and fine bakery wares, cake and dessert mixes, confectionery, chewing gum, seasonings and spice blends, beverage and soup powders, and some dairy or dairy‑analog items. Actual permissions and maximum levels depend on the food category and local rules.[^4]

## What can replace Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids?
Alternatives depend on the job it is doing in the recipe:
- Emulsifying and texture: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate)
- Dough conditioning and crumb: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Thickening and suspension: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), [sodium carboxymethyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose)

## How is Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids made?
Food producers start with fatty acids obtained from edible fats and oils, then neutralise them with sodium, potassium, or calcium compounds to form salts such as sodium stearate and calcium palmitate. Food‑grade specifications set purity criteria (for example, limits on contaminants and residuals) for these salts before they are used in foods.[^2]

## Is Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated E470a and found no safety concern at the reported uses and levels in food.[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits “salts of fatty acids” as direct food additives when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^3]

## Does Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids have any benefits?
Beyond making production run smoothly, E470a helps:
- Keep emulsions stable so sauces and fillings don’t separate
- Improve flow in dry mixes and seasonings
- Reduce sticking in molds and pans, aiding clean release and uniform shapes
- Support uniform texture in baked goods and confectionery

## Who should avoid Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids?
Most people do not need to avoid E470a. If you follow a vegan, vegetarian, kosher, or halal diet, note that the fatty acids can be sourced from either vegetable or animal fats; check the label or contact the manufacturer for sourcing details.[^2] Individuals on medically restricted sodium or potassium diets should discuss any concerns with a healthcare professional, though the amounts used in foods are typically very small.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just soap, so it doesn’t belong in food.” Fact: Although chemically related to soaps, food‑grade salts of fatty acids meet strict composition and purity specifications and are approved for use in foods under GMP.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s banned in some countries.” Fact: It is authorised in both the EU and the U.S., subject to conditions of use.[^4][^3]
- Myth: “It adds lots of fat and calories.” Fact: These salts are used at low levels for functionality, not as a fat source, so they do not meaningfully change a product’s calorie content.

## Sodium/potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids in branded foods
Ingredient lists may show this additive as “E470a,” “calcium stearate,” “sodium stearate,” or “potassium stearate.” It appears most often in baked goods, confectionery, gum, and powdery products like mixes and seasonings. Formulas change and vary by region, so check the label of the specific brand and product you buy.
