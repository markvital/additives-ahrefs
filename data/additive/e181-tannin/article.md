Tannin (E181) is a plant-derived polyphenol best known for the dry, puckering feel in tea and red wine. In foods, the additive form is usually tannic acid, used in tiny amounts to adjust flavor, help clarify beverages, and stabilize color.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural polyphenol; in additives, it’s typically “tannic acid,” a specific type of tannin.
- What it does: Adds a gentle astringent taste, helps clarify beverages, and can stabilize color.
- Where it’s used: Specialty beverages (like wine and some teas), and certain processed foods.
- Also called: Tannin, tannic acid (E181).
- Dietary notes: Plant-derived and generally suitable for vegetarians and vegans.
- Regulation: Permitted uses and limits vary by country; in the U.S., tannic acid is affirmed as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) when used at good manufacturing practice levels as a flavoring agent or adjuvant.[^1]

## Why is tannin added to food?
Tannin is added mainly for its astringent taste and its ability to fine or clarify beverages, improve mouthfeel, and help stabilize color, especially in grape and fruit-based drinks.[^2] In the United States, “tannic acid” is an approved flavoring agent or adjuvant that may be used in line with good manufacturing practice, which means the smallest amount needed to achieve the intended effect.[^1]

## What foods contain tannin?
You’ll most often encounter added tannin in beverage applications:
- Wine and cider, where it can fine, clarify, or adjust astringency.[^2]
- Some brewed or bottled teas, for consistent astringency and color.
- Certain specialty or craft beverages where flavor structure or clarity needs fine-tuning.

Note: Many foods naturally contain tannins (tea leaves, grape skins, certain nuts and fruits), so astringency is not always due to the additive.

## What can replace tannin?
Alternatives depend on the job tannin is doing:
- For tangy brightness instead of astringency: acids such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive}.
- For antioxidant or color-hold roles in some foods: [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive} or fruit pigments like [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins){.additive} (product- and regulation-dependent).
- For beverage clarity and mouthfeel: fining or texturizing agents such as [gelatine](/e428-gelatine){.additive} (not vegan) or silica-based agents like [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide){.additive}, used where permitted.

## How is tannin made?
Food-grade tannic acid is typically produced by extracting tannin-rich plant materials (such as certain galls or pods) with water or alcohol, then purifying and drying the extract to meet food specifications.[^3] International specifications describe identity and purity criteria for tannic acid used as a food additive (INS 181).[^3]

## Is tannin safe to eat?
When used as allowed in foods, tannic acid (E181) is recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a flavoring agent or adjuvant at good manufacturing practice levels.[^1] In alcoholic beverages, its use for treating and clarifying wine and juice is specifically regulated by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).[^2]

## Does tannin have any benefits?
From a food-making view, tannin can:
- Balance taste with a gentle drying, tea-like finish.
- Help clarify beverages by aiding precipitation of haze-forming compounds (especially in wine).[^2]
- Support color stability in some fruit beverages.[^3]

These are product-quality benefits, not health claims.

## Who should avoid tannin?
- People with iron-deficiency anemia or those at risk of low iron might limit tannin-rich foods and drinks around mealtimes, because tannins can reduce the absorption of non-heme iron from plant foods.[^4]
- Anyone who notices personal sensitivity to astringent compounds should check labels for “tannin” or “tannic acid.”

If you have medical or dietary concerns, ask a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Tannin always makes drinks bitter.” Fact: Tannin mainly adds a dry, puckering feel (astringency). Bitterness is a different taste.
- Myth: “If a drink is hazy, tannin will fix it.” Fact: Tannin can help in some beverages, but clarity depends on many factors, and different fining agents work for different haze types.
- Myth: “Tannin is a preservative.” Fact: Tannin can contribute to stabilization, but it’s not a broad-spectrum preservative like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or [potassium metabisulphite](/e224-potassium-metabisulphite){.additive}.

## Tannin in branded foods
You may see “tannin” or “tannic acid” on labels of some bottled teas, wine-making kits, and specialty beverages. In alcoholic drinks such as wine, use is regulated by TTB, and labeling rules can differ from those for general packaged foods.[^2] If you’re curious, check the ingredient list for “tannin” or “tannic acid,” or consult the producer.
