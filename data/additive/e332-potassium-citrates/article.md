Potassium citrates (E332) are the potassium salts of citric acid. They help foods keep a steady, gentle acidity and protect flavor, color, and texture during storage and heating. They are widely used and considered safe at normal food-use levels.

## At a glance
- What it is: A group of salts made from citric acid and potassium (mono-, di-, and tripotassium citrate).
- What it does: Controls acidity (acts as a buffer), binds trace metals (sequestrant), and helps stabilize foods.
- Where it’s found: Drinks, jams and jellies, canned fruits, desserts, powdered mixes, and many shelf-stable foods.
- Label names: “Potassium citrate,” “tripotassium citrate,” or “E332.”
- Dietary notes: Generally vegan and vegetarian friendly; not a common allergen.
- Why use potassium instead of sodium: Can help reduce sodium in recipes while giving similar technical effects.

## Why is potassium citrates added to food?
Food makers use potassium citrates to control pH, the measure of acidity. By buffering acidity, they keep foods from becoming too sour or too alkaline, which helps flavor and shelf life. They also act as sequestrants, meaning they bind tiny amounts of metals like iron and copper that can speed up off-flavors or color changes.[^1] The additive covers several specific salts—mono-, di-, and tripotassium citrate—grouped under E332 in the European Union (EU).[^2]

## What foods contain potassium citrates?
You’ll most often see potassium citrate on ingredient lists for:
- Flavored waters and soft drinks
- Fruit spreads, jams, and fillings
- Canned or jarred fruits and vegetables
- Confectionery, dessert mixes, and powdered beverages
- Some dairy-style and plant-based products

On labels, look for “potassium citrate,” “tripotassium citrate,” or “E332.”

## What can replace potassium citrates?
Depending on the job, formulators might use:
- Other citrates: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) for sharper acidity, or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) and [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates) for similar buffering.
- Other acidity regulators: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid) for mild tang, or phosphate buffers such as [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) and [potassium phosphates](/e340-potassium-phosphates).
Choice depends on taste impact, mineral content, cost, and local rules.

## How is potassium citrates made?
Potassium citrates are typically produced by neutralizing purified citric acid with a potassium base, such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate, followed by crystallization and drying. The degree of neutralization determines whether the mono-, di-, or tripotassium salt forms.[^2]

## Is potassium citrates safe to eat?
In its 2018 re-evaluation, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern for citric acid and its salts (E 330–E 333), including potassium citrates, at reported use levels, and did not set a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI).[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists potassium citrate on its Food Additive Status List, reflecting its accepted use in foods according to good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^4]

## Does potassium citrates have any benefits?
- Product quality: Stable pH helps protect flavor, color, and texture during processing and storage.
- Recipe flexibility: Works with other acids to fine-tune tartness without making foods too sour.
- Sodium reduction: Using potassium salts instead of sodium salts can support lower-sodium formulations while still providing buffering.

## Who should avoid potassium citrates?
Most people don’t need to avoid it. However, those who must limit potassium—such as people with kidney disease or individuals taking certain medicines (for example, potassium-sparing diuretics or ACE inhibitors)—should ask a healthcare professional before regularly consuming potassium-fortified or potassium-rich products.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- “E-numbers are always artificial.” E-numbers are just ID codes used in the EU. Many are familiar substances, including fruit acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- “Potassium citrate makes foods taste salty.” It has a mild taste and mainly controls acidity; it’s not a salt substitute for flavor.
- “All citrates are the same.” Different citrates (sodium, potassium, calcium) behave similarly but change mineral content and may affect taste or nutrition goals.

## Potassium citrates in branded foods
You can spot E332 on ingredient lists as “potassium citrate” or “tripotassium citrate.” It appears in many everyday items, from drinks and jams to canned fruit and dessert mixes. If you track minerals, remember it adds potassium but no sodium.
