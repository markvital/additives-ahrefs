Extracts of rosemary (E392) are natural antioxidants made from the leaves of the rosemary plant. They help keep fats and oils from going rancid, which can protect flavor, color, and nutrients in many foods. You’ll most often see them on labels as “rosemary extract” or “E 392.”

## At a glance
- What it is: Antioxidant extracts from rosemary leaves, rich in compounds like carnosic acid and carnosol
- What it does: Slows oxidation of fats and oils to keep foods fresher longer
- Common in: Cooking oils, meat and fish products, snacks, sauces, and bakery fats
- How it’s made: Extracted from rosemary using food-grade methods, then standardized for antioxidant strength
- Safety: Approved in the EU with an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI); current uses considered safe by EFSA
- Taste: Designed to work without adding strong rosemary flavor when used at antioxidant levels
- Label names: “rosemary extract,” “extracts of rosemary,” or “E 392”

## Why is Extracts of rosemary added to food?
Food fats and oils react with oxygen over time, causing off-flavors, off-odors, and loss of quality. Extracts of rosemary act as antioxidants, slowing this process so foods keep their taste and texture longer and waste is reduced.[^1] The main active compounds are carnosic acid and carnosol, two polyphenols naturally present in rosemary leaves.[^1]

## What foods contain Extracts of rosemary?
You’ll most often find rosemary extract in foods with fats and oils, where protection against oxidation is most needed. Examples include vegetable oils and fats, processed meat and fish products, cereal and bakery products, snacks, soups, and sauces.[^2] Its use and maximum levels are regulated in the EU’s food additives framework.[^3]

## What can replace Extracts of rosemary?
Several antioxidants can play a similar role, depending on the food and label goals:
- Mixed tocopherols (vitamin E), such as [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive} or [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol){.additive}
- [Ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} and synergists like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}
- Gallates such as [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate){.additive}
- Synthetic antioxidants like [tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive} or [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}

Formulators choose among these based on flavor neutrality, cost, consumer preference for “natural” options, and regulatory limits.

## How is Extracts of rosemary made?
Manufacturers start with dried rosemary leaves and extract the antioxidant compounds using food-grade processes, then purify and standardize the extract to a defined antioxidant content.[^1] EU specifications set identity criteria and limits for contaminants and residual solvents to ensure consistent quality of E 392 sold as a food additive.[^4]

## Is Extracts of rosemary safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated rosemary extracts (E 392) as a food additive and established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as the sum of carnosic acid and carnosol.[^1] A later refined exposure assessment concluded that estimated intakes from approved uses do not exceed the ADI for the general population.[^2] Within EU rules, E 392 is authorized as an antioxidant in defined food categories and at specified maximum levels.[^3]

ADI means the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Extracts of rosemary have any benefits?
For food quality, the main benefit is longer shelf life and better flavor stability, especially in fat-rich foods.[^1] This can also help keep color and reduce nutrient loss tied to oxidation. It is not used as a source of vitamins or to provide health effects to the consumer.

## Who should avoid Extracts of rosemary?
- Anyone with a known allergy or sensitivity to rosemary or related herbs should avoid products containing it.
- People advised by their healthcare professional to limit botanical extracts should check labels and follow medical guidance.
If you have specific dietary needs, ask your health professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It will make my food taste like rosemary.” Fact: When used at antioxidant levels, E 392 is formulated to minimize added flavor.
- “Natural additives don’t have limits.” Fact: Even natural additives can have ADIs and maximum use levels set by regulators.[^1]
- “It’s just ground rosemary.” Fact: The food additive is a standardized extract concentrated in antioxidant components, not the whole herb.[^4]

## Extracts of rosemary in branded foods
You can spot it on ingredient lists as “rosemary extract,” “extracts of rosemary,” or “E 392.” On multi-ingredient foods, it may appear after a category name such as “antioxidant (rosemary extract).” It is common in oils, meat and fish products, snacks, sauces, and bakery fats where keeping flavors fresh matters most.
