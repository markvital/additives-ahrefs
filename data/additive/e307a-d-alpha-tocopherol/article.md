D-Alpha-tocopherol (E307A) is the natural form of vitamin E used in foods. It acts as an antioxidant, helping keep oils and fats from turning rancid, and can also add vitamin E to a food.

## At a glance
- What it is: the natural, most active form of vitamin E (also called RRR-α-tocopherol).
- What it does: protects fats from oxidation and can fortify foods with vitamin E.
- Where it comes from: typically purified from vegetable oils.
- Label names: “D-alpha-tocopherol,” “vitamin E,” or “E307A.”
- Status: permitted in the EU as E307A and considered GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) in the U.S.
- Typical uses: cooking oils, spreads, nut and cereal products, dressings, and snack foods.

## Why is D-Alpha-tocopherol added to food?
Food makers add D-Alpha-tocopherol to slow oxidation, which is the reaction that makes fats taste stale and smell “off.” This helps keep flavor and color stable during storage.[^1] It also serves as a source of vitamin E when foods are fortified.[^1]

## What foods contain D-Alpha-tocopherol?
You’ll most often find it in foods rich in fat:
- Vegetable oils and oil blends
- Margarine and spreads
- Roasted nuts, nut butters, and trail mixes
- Baked goods and breakfast cereals
- Snack foods and salad dressings

On ingredient lists it can appear as “D-alpha-tocopherol,” “vitamin E,” or “E307A.”

## What can replace D-Alpha-tocopherol?
Several antioxidants can do similar jobs, depending on the food:
- Natural options: [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract){.additive}, [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol){.additive}, and [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary){.additive}
- Vitamin C–type helpers (synergists): [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} and [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate){.additive}, sometimes with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}
- Synthetic antioxidants: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha){.additive}, [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene){.additive}, and [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq){.additive}

## How is D-Alpha-tocopherol made?
D-Alpha-tocopherol for food use is typically obtained from vegetable oils. It is isolated and purified to meet food-grade specifications, resulting in the natural RRR-α-tocopherol form known in the EU as E307A.[^2] By contrast, the fully synthetic mixture of isomers is labeled as [DL-alpha-tocopherol (E307c)](/e307c-dl-alpha-tocopherol){.additive}.[^1]

## Is D-Alpha-tocopherol safe to eat?
In the European Union, EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) reviewed tocopherols (E306–E309) and found no safety concern at reported use levels as food additives.[^1] In the United States, the FDA lists tocopherols as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) for use in foods.[^3]

## Does D-Alpha-tocopherol have any benefits?
Yes. D-Alpha-tocopherol is vitamin E, a fat‑soluble nutrient that helps protect cells from oxidative damage.[^4] In fortified foods, it can contribute to your vitamin E intake. Natural D- forms generally have higher biological activity than synthetic DL- forms.[^4]

## Who should avoid D-Alpha-tocopherol?
- People taking blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin) should avoid high-dose vitamin E supplements because large amounts may increase bleeding risk; levels used as food additives are far lower.[^4]
- If your doctor has advised limits on fat-soluble vitamins, ask about vitamin E in supplements and fortified foods.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All vitamin E in foods is synthetic.”  
  Fact: E307A is the natural D- (RRR-) form typically purified from vegetable oils.[^2]
- Myth: “Vitamin E as an additive is used in high doses.”  
  Fact: As an antioxidant, it’s added in small amounts to protect fats; EFSA saw no safety concern at reported use levels.[^1]
- Myth: “Natural and synthetic vitamin E work the same.”  
  Fact: Natural D-α-tocopherol has higher biological activity than the DL- synthetic form.[^4]

## D-Alpha-tocopherol in branded foods
You might see D-Alpha-tocopherol on labels of cooking oils, nut mixes, breakfast cereals, snack bars, and dressings. It may be listed near the end of the ingredient list because only small amounts are needed to protect flavor and freshness.
