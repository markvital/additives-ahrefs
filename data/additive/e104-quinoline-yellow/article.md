Quinoline yellow (E104) is a synthetic lemon-yellow color used to make foods look brighter and more uniform. It is allowed in the European Union for certain foods but is not approved for use in foods in the United States. Its main role is visual—adding or restoring color.

## At a glance
- What it is: a man‑made yellow food color also called Quinoline Yellow WS and C.I. 47005
- What it does: colors foods so they look consistent from batch to batch
- Where it’s allowed: approved for selected foods in the European Union; not approved for use in U.S. foods
- How it’s labeled: “Quinoline Yellow” or “E104” on ingredient lists
- Safety notes: the EU uses an acceptable daily intake (ADI) and requires a warning label about possible effects on activity and attention in children

## Why is Quinoline yellow added to food?
Manufacturers use Quinoline yellow to give a bright, clear yellow shade. Color helps signal flavor and quality, and it keeps products looking the same over time and across seasons. Without color, many foods can look dull or inconsistent after processing or storage.

## What foods contain Quinoline yellow?
Availability depends on where you live. In the European Union, E104 is permitted in specific categories—such as some flavored drinks, confectionery, desserts, and bakery items—within set maximum levels defined in law.[^1] In the United States, Quinoline yellow is not approved for use in foods; it is permitted in certain drugs and cosmetics under the name D&C Yellow No. 10, but not in foods.[^2]

## What can replace Quinoline yellow?
Food makers often swap in other yellow-to-orange colors, depending on the shade and the rules in their market:
- Synthetic colors: [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) and [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf)
- Nature-derived colors: [curcumin](/e100-curcumin), [beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene), [annatto](/e160b-annatto), [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin), and [lutein](/e161b-lutein)

Each option has its own color tone, stability, and labeling requirements.

## How is Quinoline yellow made?
Quinoline yellow is produced by chemical synthesis. The core dye, called quinophthalone, is sulfonated (sulfur groups are added) to make water‑soluble forms; the final product is mainly the sodium salts of these sulfonated compounds.[^3] “WS” in the name stands for “water soluble.”

## Is Quinoline yellow safe to eat?
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the evidence and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. ADI means the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.[^4] The EU also requires a label statement that this color “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children,” applied to certain colors including E104, as a precautionary measure.[^5]

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Quinoline yellow for foods; it is permitted only for certain uses in drugs and cosmetics (as D&C Yellow No. 10).[^2]

## Does Quinoline yellow have any benefits?
Its benefit is visual. It gives a bright, consistent yellow color that helps consumers identify flavors and expect a certain look. It does not add taste or nutrition.

## Who should avoid Quinoline yellow?
- Caregivers who wish to follow the EU precaution about children’s attention and activity may choose products without E104.[^5]
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic colors can look for items colored with nature-derived options like [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) or [beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene).
- In the U.S., it is already absent from foods, so avoidance mainly concerns drugs and cosmetics labeled with “D&C Yellow No. 10.”[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Quinoline yellow is an azo dye. Fact: It is a quinophthalone dye; the food-grade material is a mixture of sulfonated quinophthalone salts.[^3]
- Myth: It’s banned everywhere. Fact: It is permitted in the EU in specific foods with limits, but not permitted in U.S. foods.[^1][^2]
- Myth: It is proven to cause hyperactivity. Fact: Evidence is mixed; EFSA kept an ADI after review, while the EU applies a precautionary warning label for certain colors, including E104.[^4][^5]

## Quinoline yellow in branded foods
If you shop in the EU or other countries where it is allowed, check ingredient lists for “Quinoline Yellow” or “E104.” You’ll most often see it in brightly colored soft drinks, candies, desserts, and some baked goods. In the U.S., you should not find it in foods; in drugs and cosmetics, look for “D&C Yellow No. 10.”
