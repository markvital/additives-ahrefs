      "q": "how to get e104 form",
      "a": "There is no 'E104 form' related to the food additive—E104 is simply the E‑number for the color Quinoline Yellow. If you meant the EU social-security E104 document, that’s unrelated to food additives.",

    {
      "q": "what is e104 certificate",
      "a": "There’s no special 'E104 certificate'; E104 is just the code for the color additive Quinoline Yellow (CI 47005). Suppliers may issue a certificate of analysis or specifications for a batch of the dye, but that isn’t an official E‑number certificate.",

      "q": "e104 used in what medications?",
      "a": "As a colorant excipient, Quinoline Yellow (E104; also CI 47005/D&C Yellow No. 10) is used in some tablets, capsules, and oral liquids where permitted (e.g., in the EU/UK and in U.S. drugs/cosmetics, though not in U.S. foods). Check the product’s excipient list for 'Quinoline Yellow', 'E104', 'CI 47005', or 'D&C Yellow No. 10'.",

      "a": "That query isn’t related to the food color E104; Quinoline Yellow is a synthetic dye used to color foods and some medicines. I can’t identify people or media from such references.",
