Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (E433), better known as polysorbate 80, is an emulsifier that helps oil and water mix smoothly. It keeps sauces from separating, improves the texture of ice cream, and stabilizes flavor emulsions in drinks. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow its use within set limits.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier and stabilizer that helps oil and water blend and stay mixed.
- Also called: Polysorbate 80; E433.
- What it does: Gives stable sauces and dressings, improves whipped structure and melt resistance in frozen desserts, and keeps flavor oils evenly dispersed in beverages.
- Where it’s used: Ice cream, frozen desserts, coffee creamers, salad dressings, sauces, bakery mixes, and flavored drinks.
- How much is used: Very small amounts are typically added to get the desired texture and stability.

## Why is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate added to food?
Food makers use E433 because it is a reliable “bridge” between fat and water. It lowers surface tension so tiny droplets of oil can spread and stay put. In ice cream, it helps fat and air form a fine, stable network, giving a creamy body and slower melt. In dressings and sauces, it helps prevent separation. In beverages, it can keep citrus or spice oils from rising to the top.

E433 often works alongside other emulsifiers and stabilizers. You may see it paired with [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or hydrocolloids such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) and [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum) to fine‑tune thickness and shelf stability.

## What foods contain Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate?
You might find E433 in:
- Ice cream, frozen custard, and nondairy frozen desserts
- Coffee creamers and whipped toppings
- Mayonnaise, salad dressings, and creamy sauces
- Bakery mixes, fillings, and frostings
- Flavored drinks and syrups with added oils (for example, citrus oil emulsions)
- Chewing gum and confectionery coatings

Labels may list it as “polysorbate 80,” “E433,” or “polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.”

## What can replace Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate?
Suitable substitutes depend on the food and the problem to solve:
- Emulsifiers: [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), or [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) in chocolate systems.
- Stabilizers and thickeners: [Xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum), or [sodium carboxymethyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose).
- Related polysorbates: [E432](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate), [E434](/e434-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monopalmitate), [E435](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate), and [E436](/e436-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-tristearate) can be used in similar ways, depending on fat type and processing.

## How is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate made?
E433 is produced by first making sorbitan monooleate (from sorbitol and oleic acid), then reacting it with ethylene oxide to add chains of polyoxyethylene. The result is a nonionic surfactant—meaning it carries no charge—that blends oil and water effectively.[^1]

## Is Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate safe to eat?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists polysorbate 80 as a permitted food additive for specified uses and maximum levels in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 172.840). Manufacturers must follow those limits and good manufacturing practice.[^2]

In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated polysorbates (E432–E436) and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 25 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. EFSA concluded that, at authorized uses and typical exposures, these additives are not a safety concern.[^3] The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has established the same group ADI for polysorbates.[^4]

## Does Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate have any benefits?
E433 does not provide nutritional benefits, but it improves food quality:
- Smoother texture and creaminess in frozen desserts
- Stable, uniform sauces and dressings that resist separation
- Better flavor distribution in beverages and syrups
- Improved whip and foam stability in toppings

## Who should avoid Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate?
Most people do not need to avoid E433 when it is used as authorized. Individuals who have been advised by their healthcare professional to limit emulsifiers, or who have experienced a sensitivity to polysorbates, should read labels and choose products accordingly.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Polysorbate 80 is banned.” Fact: It is authorized for use in both the U.S. and the EU under defined conditions.[^2][^1]
- Myth: “All emulsifiers are interchangeable.” Fact: Emulsifiers differ in structure and behavior; E433 is chosen for specific oil types, textures, and processing needs.
- Myth: “It’s only used in ice cream.” Fact: E433 also stabilizes dressings, toppings, bakery fillings, and flavor emulsions in drinks.

## Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate in branded foods
You can spot E433 on ingredient lists for many national and store brands of ice cream, nondairy creamers, salad dressings, and flavored beverages. Look for “polysorbate 80” or “E433” on the label. Presence and amount vary by recipe, so two similar products may differ—one may use E433 while another relies on [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids).
