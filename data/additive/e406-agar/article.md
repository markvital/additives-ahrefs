Agar (E406) is a plant-based gelling and thickening agent made from red seaweed. It helps foods set into firm, heat-stable gels and keeps sauces and desserts smooth. It is widely used in cooking and food manufacturing.

## At a glance
- What it is: a polysaccharide extracted from red seaweeds such as Gelidium and Gracilaria; affirmed as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for use in food in the United States.[^1]
- In the EU, it is an approved additive with the name “E 406 Agar” and has official purity specifications.[^2]
- What it does in food: creates firm gels, thickens, and stabilizes texture at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1]
- Safety: the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found no safety concern for agar at the levels reported for its current uses in food.[^3]

## Why is Agar added to food?
Agar is added because it forms firm, clean-tasting gels and helps stabilize and thicken many recipes. It keeps water and other ingredients evenly mixed, improving body and mouthfeel in desserts, fillings, and sauces.[^1] In short, it gives consistent texture and helps products hold their shape during storage and transport.[^1]

## What foods contain Agar?
You are most likely to find agar in:
- Fruit jellies, jelly candies, and dessert gels
- Jam, marmalade, and fruit spreads
- Plant-based yogurts and dairy-style desserts
- Bakery icings, glazes, and pie fillings
- Sauces and ready-to-eat meals where a firm or stable set is needed

Check the ingredient list for “agar,” “agar-agar,” or “E406.”

## What can replace Agar?
Depending on the texture you need, these common substitutes may work:
- For firm, sliceable gels: [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive} or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- For soft gels and fruit spreads: [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- For thickening without a firm gel: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive} or [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}
- For elastic, animal-derived gels: [gelatine](/e428-gelatine){.additive}
- For seaweed-derived thickening: [alginic acid](/e400-alginic-acid){.additive} or [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive}
- For creamy, scoopable textures: [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}, often blended with other gums

## How is Agar made?
Agar is produced by extracting natural polysaccharides from certain red seaweeds with hot water, clarifying the extract, and letting it gel. The gel is then pressed and dried (often through a freeze–thaw or drum-drying process) and milled into flakes or powder for use as a food ingredient.[^4] These steps concentrate the gelling components while removing salts, pigments, and other seaweed solids.[^4]

## Is Agar safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, agar is affirmed as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice for its stated technical effects (such as thickening and stabilizing).[^1] In the European Union, it is an authorized additive with specifications that control identity and purity.[^2] EFSA’s re‑evaluation concluded there is no safety concern for agar at the reported levels of use in foods.[^3]

## Does Agar have any benefits?
- It is plant-based, so it suits vegetarian and vegan diets.
- It makes firm gels that stay stable at warm serving temperatures.
- It is not digested to a significant extent and functions like dietary fiber in the gut, contributing little energy while helping texture and stability.[^3]

## Who should avoid Agar?
Most people do not need to avoid agar in normal food amounts. If you are on a medically prescribed low-fiber diet, have known gastrointestinal narrowing, or have been told to limit bulking agents, ask your healthcare provider before using high-gelling products made with agar.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Agar is the same as gelatin.” Fact: Agar comes from seaweed and makes firmer, heat-stable gels; [gelatine](/e428-gelatine){.additive} is animal-derived and gives elastic, melt-in-the-mouth gels.
- Myth: “Agar and carrageenan are identical.” Fact: Both are seaweed-derived, but they are different additives with different properties and E-numbers (E406 vs. [E407](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}).
- Myth: “Agar is unsafe because of heavy metals from the ocean.” Fact: EU specifications set strict purity limits for contaminants in E 406, including heavy metals, to ensure safety and quality.[^2]

## Agar in branded foods
On labels you may see it listed as “agar,” “agar-agar,” or simply “E406.”[^4] It is common in shelf-stable dessert cups, fruit jellies and spreads, plant-based dairy alternatives, filled pastries, and some ready meals. If you need to avoid or choose it, read ingredient lists and look for these names.
