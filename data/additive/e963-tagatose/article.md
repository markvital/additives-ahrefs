Tagatose (E963) is a low-calorie sweetener that tastes and behaves a lot like table sugar. It sweetens, adds bulk, and even browns during baking, which helps reduced-sugar foods keep a familiar taste and texture. It is authorized as a food additive in the EU and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for specific uses in the United States.

## At a glance
- What it is: A sugar-like sweetener used to reduce sugar while keeping taste and texture
- What it does: Sweetens, provides bulk, browns in baking, and works well with other sweeteners
- Label names: “Tagatose,” “D-tagatose,” or “E963”
- Typical foods: Sugar-reduced chocolate, cereals, frozen desserts, dairy drinks, chewing gum, candies, baked goods
- Heat and pH: Heat-stable enough for many baked and cooked foods; performs best at neutral to slightly acidic pH
- Nutrition: Fewer calories than sucrose (table sugar); still counts toward total carbohydrates
- Tolerance: Large servings may cause gas or a laxative effect in some people
- Dietary notes: Made from milk sugar (lactose), but the final ingredient is purified carbohydrate; check the label or manufacturer for allergen statements

## Why is Tagatose added to food?
Food makers use tagatose to cut sugar while keeping a sugar-like taste and body. It helps with browning and caramel-like notes in baked goods, improves mouthfeel in reduced-sugar chocolate and dairy, and balances flavor in beverages. In the European Union, tagatose is listed as food additive E963 under the food additives framework, which defines how and where it may be used.[^4]

## What foods contain Tagatose?
You’ll most often see tagatose in:
- Reduced-sugar or “no added sugar” chocolate and confectionery
- Ready-to-eat cereals and cereal bars
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Yogurt drinks and flavored milks
- Chewing gum and hard or chewy candies
- Baked goods, frostings, and fillings
- Powdered drink mixes and flavored waters

On ingredient lists, look for “tagatose,” “D-tagatose,” or “E963” (EU). It is often blended with other sweeteners to fine-tune sweetness and flavor.

## What can replace Tagatose?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- To sweeten without adding much bulk: [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}, or [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}
- To add bulk and some sweetness: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}, [xylitol](/e967-xylitol){.additive}, [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive}, or [mannitol](/e421-mannitol){.additive}
- To keep a more “natural” label: [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive} from stevia
No single sweetener mimics sugar in every way, so blends are common.

## How is Tagatose made?
Commercial tagatose usually starts from lactose (milk sugar). Manufacturers split lactose into glucose and galactose, then convert galactose to D‑tagatose through an enzyme‑catalyzed epimerization step, followed by purification and crystallization.[^2] In the EU, there are official identity and purity specifications for E963 that set limits on impurities and ensure consistent quality.[^1]

## Is Tagatose safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed tagatose and allow it for specific uses. In the United States, D‑tagatose has GRAS status for certain food categories based on safety data reviewed by the FDA.[^2] Internationally, Codex Alimentarius lists tagatose (INS 963) as a sweetener in its General Standard for Food Additives.[^3]

Like many low-digestible carbohydrates, large single servings may cause gas, bloating, or diarrhea in some people, especially when consumed quickly or on an empty stomach.[^2] Start with small portions to gauge your personal tolerance.

## Does Tagatose have any benefits?
- Sugar-like function: It sweetens and browns, so you can reduce added sugar without losing as much taste, color, or texture.
- Fewer calories than sucrose: It can help lower the calorie content of sweet foods.
- Works in blends: It can smooth out the taste of high‑intensity sweeteners and improve mouthfeel.

These are formulation benefits; overall diet and portion size still matter.

## Who should avoid Tagatose?
- People sensitive to FODMAPs or prone to GI upset may want to limit large servings.
- Children may be more sensitive to laxative effects from big single doses.
- Individuals with medical conditions affecting carbohydrate digestion or metabolism should follow advice from their healthcare professional.
If you have a milk allergy, check the product’s allergen statement; tagatose is purified, but manufacturers control allergen management differently.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a sugar alcohol.” — Myth. Tagatose is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar), not a sugar alcohol.
- “It’s calorie‑free.” — Myth. Tagatose has fewer calories than sugar, but it still contributes some calories and carbs.
- “It won’t brown like sugar.” — Myth. Tagatose participates in browning reactions, which is one reason bakers like it.
- “All sweeteners taste the same.” — Myth. Tagatose has a sugar‑like profile and can mask off‑notes from other sweeteners in blends.

## Tagatose in branded foods
You’ll find tagatose in many reduced‑sugar products across grocery stores: chocolates, ice creams, breakfast cereals, nutrition bars, flavored milks, chewing gum, and more. Check the ingredient list for “tagatose” or “E963.” Products may also pair it with other sweeteners to reach the desired sweetness and texture while keeping calories and sugars lower.
