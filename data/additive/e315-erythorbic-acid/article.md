Erythorbic acid (E315), also called isoascorbic acid, is an antioxidant used to keep foods fresh-looking and flavorful. It slows down browning and rancidity, especially in cured meats and processed foods, and helps protect color and taste during storage.

## At a glance
- What it is: A stereoisomer (close chemical cousin) of vitamin C used as a food antioxidant.
- What it does: Helps prevent oxidation, supports cured meat color, and protects flavor.
- Common places you’ll see it: Bacon and deli meats, canned and frozen produce, sauces, and drinks.
- Label names: “Erythorbic acid” or “isoascorbic acid.”
- Regulatory status: Permitted as a food additive in the U.S. and EU under specific rules.

## Why is Erythorbic acid added to food?
Food makers add erythorbic acid to slow oxidation—the chemical reactions that cause browning, color loss, off-flavors, and rancid notes. In cured meats, it also acts as a “cure accelerator,” helping nitrite do its job faster and more reliably so the meat develops the expected color and flavor. In the U.S., its use in meat and poultry products is specifically allowed, and for certain products like pumped bacon, ascorbate or erythorbate is required alongside nitrite to control unwanted nitrosamine formation.[^1] The European Union (EU) likewise authorizes E315 as an antioxidant in various food categories.[^4]

## What foods contain Erythorbic acid?
You’re most likely to find E315 in:
- Cured meats such as bacon, ham, corned beef, and hot dogs/sausages (used to stabilize color and flavor)[^1]
- Canned or bottled vegetables and fruits (to limit browning)[^4]
- Frozen and prepared potato products (to maintain color)[^4]
- Sauces, dressings, and beverages (to protect flavor and color)[^4]

Exact uses and limits vary by product type and region; manufacturers must follow applicable regulations.[^1][^4]

## What can replace Erythorbic acid?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and goal:
- Vitamin C forms: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate), or the closely related [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate)
- Other antioxidants: [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Acidulants and natural extracts that can support color/flavor stability in some foods: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) and [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)

The best substitute depends on the food’s pH, fat content, processing steps, and label goals.

## How is Erythorbic acid made?
Commercial erythorbic acid is produced from sugars using a combination of fermentation and chemical steps that build the same antioxidant ring structure found in vitamin C, but with a different spatial arrangement. The EU sets identity and purity specifications for E315, outlining accepted manufacturing routes and quality criteria for the additive used in food.[^5]

## Is Erythorbic acid safe to eat?
Regulators in the United States (Food and Drug Administration, FDA) and the European Union permit erythorbic acid as a food additive when used according to good manufacturing practice and any product-specific limits.[^2][^4] In meat and poultry, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations list erythorbic acid/erythorbate among the allowed ingredients and specify when and how they can be used.[^1]

## Does Erythorbic acid have any benefits?
Erythorbic acid helps foods keep their intended color and taste. In cured meats, it speeds curing reactions and is used to help limit the formation of nitrosamines, particularly in products like bacon where it is paired with nitrite by rule.[^1] Chemically, it’s a stereoisomer of vitamin C, but in food it’s used for technology and quality, not as a nutrient.[^6]

## Who should avoid Erythorbic acid?
- There are no specific consumer groups that regulators single out to avoid E315 when it’s used as intended.
- If you are following medical advice to limit certain additives, or you react to antioxidant additives in general, review labels and consult your healthcare provider.
- Watching sodium? The related salt [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate) appears on labels separately from erythorbic acid.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Erythorbic acid is the same as vitamin C.” Fact: It’s a close chemical cousin (stereoisomer), but it’s added for antioxidant performance in foods, not as a vitamin.[^6]
- Myth: “It cures meat by itself.” Fact: It supports curing with nitrite; it doesn’t replace nitrite.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s only used in meat.” Fact: It’s authorized in a range of foods to help prevent oxidation and browning.[^4]

## Erythorbic acid in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “erythorbic acid” or “isoascorbic acid.” You’ll often see it on labels of bacon, deli meats, and hot dogs, and sometimes in canned vegetables, frozen potatoes, sauces, and drinks. Availability and usage vary by brand and region—check the ingredient list for the most accurate information.
