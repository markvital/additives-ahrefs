Orcein (E 182) is a reddish-brown dye made from certain lichens. It is a niche food color today, used mainly in a few specialty applications and tightly regulated in some regions. It does not add flavor or nutrition—its role is purely visual.

## At a glance
- What it is: a natural mixture of color compounds made from lichens
- What it does: gives foods a red‑brown to purple‑brown tint on the surface
- How common: rare in modern foods; use is limited by law in many places
- Labeling: may appear as “Orcein” or “E 182”
- Regulatory status: authorized for restricted uses in the European Union (EU); not listed for food use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

## Why is Orcein added to food?
Orcein is used to add or restore a brownish or reddish tone. It helps give a uniform, traditional look to certain specialty foods where color is applied on the surface rather than throughout the product. Because it is a natural color, some makers choose it to match historic recipes or regional styles.[^2]

## What foods contain Orcein?
You are unlikely to find orcein in everyday groceries. Where allowed, it has niche roles, most often for coloring the outside of specialty items rather than the whole food. Always check the ingredient list for “Orcein” or “E 182” if you are looking for it.[^2]

## What can replace Orcein?
Depending on the shade and use, makers may choose other approved colors:
- For brown tones: [caramel](/e150-caramel)
- For orange-red: [annatto](/e160b-annatto) or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
- For red: [cochineal](/e120-cochineal) or [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red)

## How is Orcein made?
In the EU specification, orcein is described as a mixture of related dye molecules produced from certain lichens. Manufacturers extract lichen material with ammonia, then allow air (oxygen) to react with the extract to form the characteristic orcein colors. The specification also sets identity and purity rules, including limits for contaminants and permitted processing aids.[^1]

## Is Orcein safe to eat?
In the European Union, food additives can be used only after a safety evaluation and an authorization that defines where and how much may be used. Orcein (E 182) has an official EU specification and is authorized only in limited uses, which keeps exposure very low.[^2] Its composition and purity are controlled by detailed EU criteria to help ensure safe use in foods.[^1]

In the United States, orcein is not listed by the FDA as a color additive for use in foods. This means it is not permitted for general food coloring under U.S. regulations.[^3]

## Does Orcein have any benefits?
Orcein does not add nutrients or flavor. Its benefit is cosmetic: it gives a traditional brown-red look that some producers and consumers expect in certain specialty foods.[^2]

## Who should avoid Orcein?
- If you prefer to avoid added colors of any kind, choose products labeled without added color.
- If you live in or buy products made for the U.S. market, you are unlikely to encounter orcein, because it is not approved there for food coloring.[^3]
- People with a history of reactions to food colors may wish to consult a healthcare professional before consuming foods with added colors.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Orcein is a synthetic dye. Fact: EU specifications describe it as a mixture obtained from lichens via ammonia extraction and air oxidation.[^1]
- Myth: Orcein is widely used in modern foods. Fact: Its authorized uses are narrow and limited in the EU, and it is not listed for food use by the U.S. FDA.[^2][^3]
- Myth: Orcein changes flavor. Fact: It is used as a color only; it does not add flavor when used as intended.[^2]

## Orcein in branded foods
You will mostly see orcein, if at all, on the labels of specialty products sold in markets where its limited uses are authorized. Look for it by name or as “E 182” on the ingredient list.[^2]
