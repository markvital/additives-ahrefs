Calcium benzoate (E213) is a preservative used to keep foods and drinks from spoiling, especially when they are acidic. It helps prevent the growth of yeasts, molds, and some bacteria, which can extend shelf life and reduce food waste. It is one of several benzoate salts approved for use in many regions.

## At a glance
- Role: preservative for acidic foods and beverages
- Chemistry: the calcium salt of [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid){.additive}
- Works best at low pH (more acidic foods)
- Common in fruit drinks, pickles, sauces, and dressings
- EU re-evaluation keeps a group ADI (acceptable daily intake) for benzoates of 5 mg/kg body weight per day, expressed as benzoic acid[^1]
- Authorized in the EU as E213 and subject to purity criteria; permitted in the U.S. under good manufacturing practice[^2][^3]

## Why is calcium benzoate added to food?
Food makers use calcium benzoate to slow the growth of microbes that spoil food. It is most effective in acidic products because the undissociated form of benzoic acid is the active antimicrobial species at low pH.[^1] By keeping yeast and mold in check, it helps maintain taste, texture, and safety during shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain calcium benzoate?
You are most likely to find calcium benzoate in products that are already acidic or are formulated to be acidic. Examples include:
- Fruit-flavored drinks and carbonated beverages
- Pickles, relishes, and some condiments and sauces
- Vinegar-based salad dressings and marinades
- Sweet spreads and dessert toppings

In the EU, benzoates (the group that includes E210–E213) are authorized in selected food categories with maximum levels defined in legislation; exact allowances vary by product type.[^2]

## What can replace calcium benzoate?
Depending on the recipe and pH, food makers may use:
- Other benzoates: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} or [potassium benzoate](/e212-potassium-benzoate){.additive}
- Sorbates: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}
- Acidification to improve preservative action: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive}, [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid){.additive}, or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive}

The best substitute depends on taste, pH, and the microbes of concern.

## How is calcium benzoate made?
Manufacturers typically neutralize purified [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid){.additive} with a calcium base (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate) to form the calcium salt, then filter and dry it. The final product must meet additive purity criteria set in EU specifications for food additives.[^1][^2]

## Is calcium benzoate safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed benzoates extensively. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for benzoates of 5 mg/kg body weight per day, expressed as benzoic acid, and concluded current uses do not raise safety concerns when used within authorized levels.[^1] In the United States, calcium benzoate appears on FDA’s Food Additive Status List as permitted when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

One known issue is benzene formation: in beverages that contain both benzoate and [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} (vitamin C), small amounts of benzene can form over time, especially with heat and light. FDA has investigated this and works with manufacturers to control it; most tested beverages have levels well below drinking water standards.[^4]

## Does calcium benzoate have any benefits?
- Extends shelf life by slowing spoilage from yeasts and molds[^1]
- Helps keep foods safe and reduces product waste
- Offers a non-sodium benzoate option where sodium content is a concern (it contributes calcium instead of sodium)

## Who should avoid calcium benzoate?
- Individuals with a known sensitivity to benzoates should avoid it and related preservatives.
- People following specific medical advice to avoid benzoates (for example, due to a diagnosed intolerance) should read labels carefully.
- For infants and very young children, always follow regional rules and product guidance; preservative use is more restricted in these foods in many jurisdictions.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Benzoates are effective in any food.” Fact: Benzoates work best in acidic foods; their antimicrobial action drops as pH rises.[^1]
- Myth: “Benzoates always create dangerous benzene.” Fact: Benzene can form only under certain conditions (with vitamin C, heat, light); industry and regulators monitor and manage this issue in beverages.[^4]
- Myth: “Calcium benzoate isn’t allowed in the U.S.” Fact: FDA lists calcium benzoate as permitted when used according to good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Calcium benzoate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “calcium benzoate” or “E213” (the E-number may be shown in the EU). It most often appears in acidic drinks, pickled products, sauces, and dressings. If you are checking a specific brand, the package label or the company’s product page usually lists preservatives.
