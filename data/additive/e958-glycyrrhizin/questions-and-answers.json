      "q": "how much glycyrrhizin in licorice root",
      "a": "Dried licorice root typically contains about 2–9% glycyrrhizin by weight, while concentrated licorice extracts can contain roughly 10–25%.",

    {
      "q": "does red licorice contain glycyrrhizin",
      "a": "Usually no—red licorice candy is typically flavored without real licorice and lacks glycyrrhizin unless “licorice extract” (or glycyrrhizin/ammonium glycyrrhizate) appears on the ingredient list.",

    {
      "q": "glycyrrhizin licorice which one works",
      "a": "Glycyrrhizin is the licorice component that provides the characteristic sweetness and the mineralocorticoid-like effects; products labeled DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) have most glycyrrhizin removed and won’t produce those glycyrrhizin-related effects.",

    {
      "q": "how does glycyrrhizin lower potassium",
      "a": "It’s metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid, which inhibits 11β‑HSD2 in the kidney, allowing cortisol to activate mineralocorticoid receptors—this increases sodium retention and potassium loss (hypokalemia).",

    {
      "q": "how much glycyrrhizin in whole foods dgl",
      "a": "DGL is processed to remove glycyrrhizin and usually contains only trace amounts (often under 1%, sometimes <0.1%); check the specific product label for its stated glycyrrhizin content.",
