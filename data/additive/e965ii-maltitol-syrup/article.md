Maltitol syrup (E965II) is a sugar alcohol used to sweeten foods with fewer calories than sugar. It also adds bulk and moisture, making it useful in sugar-free candies, baked goods, and frozen desserts. It tastes similar to sugar and helps keep products soft.

## At a glance
- What it is: A sweet, viscous sugar alcohol syrup made from starch
- What it does: Sweetener, humectant (keeps moisture), stabiliser, and thickener
- Where you’ll see it: “Sugar-free” or “no added sugar” chocolates, biscuits, bars, ice creams, and chewing gum
- Calories: 2.4 kcal per gram in U.S. labeling, lower than table sugar
- E-number: E965II (the solid form is [maltitol](/e965-maltitol){.additive})

## Why is Maltitol syrup added to food?
Maltitol syrup sweetens like sugar but with fewer calories. It also provides bulk, body, and shine, which high-intensity sweeteners alone cannot do. As a humectant, it helps products stay soft and prevents them from drying out. In fillings and glazes, it adds a smooth texture and helps resist crystallisation.

## What foods contain Maltitol syrup?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Sugar-free or no-added-sugar chocolates and chocolate-coated bars
- Biscuits, cakes, and pastries with reduced sugar
- Chewing gum and chewy candies
- Ice creams, gelato, and frozen desserts
- Dessert sauces, fruit preps, and bakery fillings

On labels, it may appear as “maltitol syrup” or “E965ii” (in the EU).

## What can replace Maltitol syrup?
It depends on what you need:
- For similar bulk and mild sweetness: [maltitol](/e965-maltitol){.additive} (crystalline), [isomalt](/e953-isomalt){.additive}, [xylitol](/e967-xylitol){.additive}, or [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}
- For moisture control: [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive} or [glycerol](/e422-glycerol){.additive}
- For more sweetness without bulk: [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}, [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}, [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}
- For syrups with similar functionality: [polyglycitol syrup](/e964-polyglycitol-syrup){.additive}
Sometimes a blend works best—for example, maltitol syrup for bulk plus a high‑intensity sweetener for sweetness, and a stabiliser like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive} for texture.

## How is Maltitol syrup made?
Maltitol syrup is produced by hydrogenating starch hydrolysates (starch broken down into smaller sugars, especially maltose). The result is a mixture mainly containing maltitol, along with small amounts of sorbitol and higher hydrogenated saccharides. In the EU, detailed identity and purity specifications for E965ii are set by Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1]

## Is Maltitol syrup safe to eat?
Maltitol syrup is an authorised food additive in the European Union (E965ii), with specifications laid out in EU law.[^1] In the United States, sugar alcohols like maltitol are permitted ingredients and must be counted for calories under the Nutrition Facts rules; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets 2.4 kcal per gram for sugar alcohols (except erythritol).[^2] Like other polyols (sugar alcohols), large amounts can cause gas or a laxative effect in some people. FDA requires a laxative warning for certain other polyols (sorbitol and mannitol) when consumed at high amounts, which reflects this general tolerance issue.[^3]

## Does Maltitol syrup have any benefits?
- Fewer calories than sugar: U.S. labeling assigns sugar alcohols 2.4 kcal/g (sucrose is 4 kcal/g).[^2]
- Tooth-friendly: FDA allows a health claim for “noncariogenic” carbohydrate sweeteners that do not promote dental caries when used to replace sugar in foods, a category that includes sugar alcohols.[^4]
- Functionality: It provides bulk, browning, body, and moisture closer to sugar than many other sugar replacers, which helps match the taste and texture of the original recipe.

## Who should avoid Maltitol syrup?
- People sensitive to sugar alcohols: Some individuals experience bloating, gas, or a laxative effect when consuming large amounts of polyols.[^3]
- Young children and those new to polyols: Start with small portions to assess tolerance.
- People tracking carbs: Maltitol syrup still provides calories and carbohydrates. Check the Nutrition Facts and serving size.[^2]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Maltitol syrup is zero‑calorie.” Fact: Sugar alcohols count as 2.4 kcal/g for U.S. labeling (less than sugar, but not zero).[^2]
- Myth: “It rots your teeth like sugar.” Fact: FDA recognises certain sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, as noncariogenic when they replace sugars and do not lower plaque pH below the critical level.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s just another artificial sweetener.” Fact: It’s a sugar alcohol made by hydrogenating starch-derived sugars; it also adds bulk and texture, unlike high‑intensity sweeteners.

## Maltitol syrup in branded foods
You’ll see maltitol syrup in many “sugar-free” or “no added sugar” chocolates, biscuits, cereal and protein bars, chewing gums, and ice creams. On ingredient lists, look for “maltitol syrup,” sometimes alongside another sweetener for extra sweetness. If you are sensitive to polyols, check the serving size and consider starting with a small amount.
