Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30), also known by its E‑number E160f, is an orange carotenoid food color. It gives foods and drinks a warm yellow‑orange shade, similar to what you get from other carotenoids like beta‑carotene.

## At a glance
This additive is a synthetic carotenoid used to color foods and beverages.  
- Role: colour (orange to yellow‑orange)  
- Typical formats: oil suspensions or water‑dispersible preparations  
- Common uses: beverages, confectionery, bakery items, sauces, and spreads  
- Labeling: may appear as “E160f” or “ethyl ester of beta‑apo‑8'-carotenic acid (C 30)”  
- Regulatory status: authorized in the EU with purity specifications; also listed by the U.S. FDA on its Color Additive Status List  

## Why is Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30) added to food?
Manufacturers use E160f to bring back or boost an appetizing orange or yellow‑orange color. Color can fade during processing or storage, so a stable colorant helps products look consistent on the shelf. As a carotenoid, it provides a warm, natural‑looking hue similar to [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), but with its own shade and stability profile.

## What foods contain Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30)?
You’ll mainly see it in foods where an orange tint is desired:
- Soft drinks and flavored beverages
- Confectionery, gummies, and coated sweets
- Bakery items, fillings, and frostings
- Sauces, soups, seasonings, and savory snacks
- Fats and spreads such as margarine and similar products

In the EU, E160f is an authorized color additive listed in the food additives regulation; permitted use depends on the food category and must follow the conditions set out in Annex II of the law.[^2]

## What can replace Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30)?
Alternatives depend on the exact shade and processing needs:
- Other carotenoids: [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), and [beta-apo-8'-carotenal (C 30)](/e160e-beta-apo-8-carotenal-c30)
- Plant extracts: [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract), [annatto](/e160b-annatto), or [curcumin](/e100-curcumin)
- Non-carotenoid colors for brownish tones: [plain caramel](/e150a-plain-caramel)

Formulators choose based on color shade, solubility (oil vs water), heat/light stability, and label preferences.

## How is Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30) made?
E160f is produced by chemical synthesis to create the carotenoid molecule known as the ethyl ester of beta‑apo‑8'‑carotenic acid. The pure pigment is usually blended and standardized in edible oils or prepared as dispersible forms so it can be dosed accurately into foods. Its identity and purity (including limits for contaminants) are defined in the EU food additive specifications.[^1]

## Is Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30) safe to eat?
In the European Union, E160f is authorized as a food color and must meet strict composition and purity criteria before it can be used.[^1] Authorizations for food additives in the EU are based on a safety evaluation and conditions of use laid down in the food additives regulation.[^2] In the United States, the additive appears on FDA’s Color Additive Status List, which tracks colors permitted for specified uses under federal regulations.[^3]

As with all colors, manufacturers must use only as much as needed to achieve the intended effect and comply with any category‑specific rules.

## Does Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30) have any benefits?
Its purpose is aesthetic—it adds color. E160f is not added for nutrition, flavor, or preservation. In regulatory terms it is a “colour” additive, not a nutrient or supplement, and its use is limited to coloring foods under the applicable rules.[^2]

## Who should avoid Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30)?
- People who prefer to avoid added colors for personal reasons can check labels for “E160f” or the full chemical name.  
- Individuals with sensitivities to specific formulation ingredients (for example, certain emulsifiers or antioxidants sometimes used in color preparations) should review ingredient lists or contact the manufacturer. The pigment itself is not a known common allergen.

If you have dietary restrictions or medical advice to limit food colors, consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E160f is the same as beta‑carotene (vitamin A).”  
  Fact: E160f is a related carotenoid used only for color. It is not used as a vitamin A source.

- Myth: “All orange colors are natural plant extracts.”  
  Fact: Some are plant‑derived (like [annatto](/e160b-annatto) or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)), while E160f is produced by synthesis to deliver a consistent shade.

- Myth: “Colors are added only to hide poor quality.”  
  Fact: Colors help keep appearance uniform after heat, light, or storage changes. They don’t replace quality control or safety standards set by law.[^2]

## Ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid (C 30) in branded foods
On labels, look for:
- “E160f”
- “Ethyl ester of beta‑apo‑8'-carotenic acid (C 30)”
- Sometimes listed within a “color” or “colours” grouping

It’s most common in brightly colored drinks, sweets, bakery decorations, and orange‑toned spreads. Many brands use a mix of colors to fine‑tune shade and stability, so E160f may appear alongside other carotenoids like [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) or plant colors such as [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract).
