Hydrogenated poly-1-decene (E907) is a food-grade synthetic wax used mainly to coat or glaze foods. It helps give products a smooth, shiny surface and keeps pieces from sticking together during storage and transport.

## At a glance
- What it is: a clear, odorless, crystalline hydrocarbon wax made by hydrogenating polymerized 1-decene.
- What it does: acts as a glazing agent and protective surface coating; also helps reduce sticking.
- Where you’ll see it: on ingredient lists as “E907,” “hydrogenated poly-1-decene,” or “crystalline wax.”
- Source and diet: petroleum-derived and not animal-based.
- Regulation: authorized in the European Union (EU) with set purity criteria and defined uses.

## Why is Hydrogenated poly-1-decene added to food?
Manufacturers use E907 to form a thin, even coating that adds gloss, limits moisture loss or pickup, and prevents pieces from sticking together. In EU law, it falls under the functional class of “glazing agents,” which are used to give a protective coating or shine to the surface of foods.[^2]

## What foods contain Hydrogenated poly-1-decene?
You’ll most often find E907 in items that benefit from a smooth, shiny surface or an anti-sticking finish—for example, coated confectionery and similar glazed or polished products. In the EU, its authorized uses and conditions are listed on the Union list of food additives (Annex II of the food additives regulation). Always check the ingredient list for “E907” or “hydrogenated poly-1-decene.”[^3]

## What can replace Hydrogenated poly-1-decene?
Food makers can choose other glazing or surface treatment agents depending on the product and label goals:
- Plant waxes such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax)
- Resin-based coatings like [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- Bee-derived waxes such as [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax)
- Petroleum-derived waxes like [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax)
- Other specialty coatings such as [montanic acid esters](/e912-montanic-acid-esters)

## How is Hydrogenated poly-1-decene made?
E907 is produced by first polymerizing 1-decene (a simple hydrocarbon) into a mixture of higher molecular weight molecules and then hydrogenating (adding hydrogen to) that mixture. Hydrogenation saturates the molecules, yielding a stable, food-grade crystalline wax with defined purity and composition criteria in EU specifications.[^1]

## Is Hydrogenated poly-1-decene safe to eat?
In the EU, food additives are authorized only after safety evaluation and are subject to strict specifications and use conditions. E907 has specific identity and purity criteria and is listed for use as a glazing agent under EU food additive rules.[^1][^2] Its permitted uses and maximum levels (or good manufacturing practice limits, where applicable) are set out in the Union list of food additives.[^3]

## Does Hydrogenated poly-1-decene have any benefits?
- Improves product appearance by adding a uniform shine.
- Acts as a moisture and stick barrier to help maintain texture during shelf life.
- Aids processing by reducing sticking and dusting during coating or polishing.

## Who should avoid Hydrogenated poly-1-decene?
- People who prefer to avoid petroleum-derived ingredients for personal or dietary reasons.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit specific food additives should follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are automatically unsafe.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is authorized for use in the EU with defined conditions following safety evaluation.[^2]
- Myth: “Hydrogenated poly-1-decene is just ‘plastic’ on food.” Fact: E907 is a specific food-grade hydrocarbon wax with strict identity and purity criteria set in EU law.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s hidden on labels.” Fact: In the EU it must appear in the ingredient list by name or as “E907,” so consumers can identify it.

## Hydrogenated poly-1-decene in branded foods
On labels, look for “hydrogenated poly-1-decene,” “crystalline wax,” or “E907,” especially on glazed or polished confectionery and other coated products. Availability and usage vary by brand and country, so checking the ingredient list is the most reliable way to confirm its presence.
