Monocalcium phosphate (E341i) is a calcium phosphate salt used mainly as a fast-acting leavening acid in baking. It helps doughs and batters rise, stabilizes acidity, and can add a small amount of calcium to foods. It is widely used in baking powder and self-rising flour.

## At a glance
- What it is: a food-grade mineral salt of calcium and phosphate
- What it does: leavening acid, acidity regulator, stabilizer, and calcium source
- Where it’s found: baking powder, self-rising flour, pancake mixes, biscuits, cakes
- Diet notes: typically vegan and gluten-free; sodium-free leavening acid
- Regulation: permitted in the U.S. and EU with specifications and use limits

## Why is Monocalcium phosphate added to food?
Bakers use monocalcium phosphate because it reacts with baking soda to release carbon dioxide gas, which makes doughs and batters rise. As a “fast-acting” leavening acid, it starts working as soon as it is moistened, so it is common in baking powders and quick-bake mixes.

It also helps control acidity (pH) and can improve dough handling and crumb texture. In some products it contributes a small amount of calcium without adding sodium, which is helpful in low-sodium formulations.

## What foods contain Monocalcium phosphate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Baking powder and self-rising flour
- Pancake and waffle mixes
- Biscuits, scones, muffins, and cakes
- Some tortillas and flatbreads
- Ready-to-bake cookie and cake doughs

In the U.S., the standard of identity for self-rising flour explicitly allows leavening systems that include monocalcium phosphate alongside baking soda.[^1]

## What can replace Monocalcium phosphate?
Depending on the recipe or product, food makers may use other leavening acids or acidulants:
- [Dicalcium phosphate](/e341ii-dicalcium-phosphate){.additive} (E341ii)
- [Disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate){.additive} (E450i, often called SAPP)
- [Sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate){.additive} (E541)
- [Monopotassium tartrate](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate){.additive} (E336i, “cream of tartar”)
- [Glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone){.additive} (E575)
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} (E330) in some quick bakes and beverages

These alternatives differ in reaction speed, taste impact, sodium content, and how they behave during mixing and baking.

## How is Monocalcium phosphate made?
Food-grade monocalcium phosphate is made by carefully neutralizing purified [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} with a calcium source such as [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate){.additive} or [calcium hydroxide](/e526-calcium-hydroxide){.additive}, then drying and milling the crystals.[^2] It is produced as a monohydrate or anhydrous form, both of which have defined purity criteria in the EU food additive specifications.[^2]

Within the EU additive family “E341 calcium phosphates,” monocalcium phosphate is designated as E341(i), distinct from dicalcium (E341(ii)) and tricalcium (E341(iii)) phosphates.[^2]

## Is Monocalcium phosphate safe to eat?
Yes. Monocalcium phosphate is an approved food additive in both the United States and the European Union when used as intended in foods.[^3] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphate additives of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day, covering E338–E341 and related phosphate additives.[^4]

EFSA also noted that in some population groups, high consumers (especially children) could exceed this ADI, so overall phosphate intake from diet and additives should be monitored.[^4] If you are watching your phosphorus intake, check labels for phosphate ingredients.

## Does Monocalcium phosphate have any benefits?
- Reliable rise: It provides consistent gas release for quick breads, biscuits, and cakes.
- Low sodium: It supplies leavening without adding sodium, unlike some alternatives.
- Calcium contribution: It can add a small amount of calcium to the finished food.
- Predictable handling: It helps set batter pH, which supports even crumb and color.

In many formulas, it pairs with [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive} to deliver the desired rise during mixing and baking.

## Who should avoid Monocalcium phosphate?
People who must limit phosphorus—such as those with chronic kidney disease—should monitor intake of phosphate additives, including monocalcium phosphate, as part of their overall phosphorus management.[^5] If your clinician has advised a low-phosphorus diet, review ingredient lists for “phosphate” additives and discuss suitable alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Monocalcium phosphate contains aluminum.”  
  Fact: It is aluminum-free. Aluminum-based leavening acids are separate additives, such as [sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate){.additive}.

- Myth: “All phosphates are the same.”  
  Fact: E341(i) (mono-), E341(ii) (di-), and E341(iii) (tri-calcium phosphates) behave differently and are used for different purposes.

- Myth: “It’s synthetic and not from natural sources.”  
  Fact: Food-grade monocalcium phosphate is made from mineral sources (calcium compounds and phosphoric acid) under strict purity standards.[^2]

## Monocalcium phosphate in branded foods
You’ll commonly find it on ingredient lists for national-brand baking powders, self-rising flours, pancake mixes, biscuit mixes, tortillas, and many shelf-stable baking kits. On labels, it may appear as “monocalcium phosphate,” “E341(i),” or simply “E341i.”
