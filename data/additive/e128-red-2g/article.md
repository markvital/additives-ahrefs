Red 2G (E128) is a synthetic red azo dye that was once used to give meat products a brighter, stable red color. The European Union suspended its use in 2007 after new safety concerns, and it is not approved in the United States. Today, it is rarely seen on ingredient lists.

## At a glance
- Function: colour (synthetic red azo dye)
- Typical past uses: breakfast sausages and burger meat mixes
- Status: suspended in the EU since 2007; not approved in the U.S.
- Other names: E128, Red 2G

## Why is Red 2G added to food?
Manufacturers used Red 2G to make certain meat products look fresh and evenly red. It offered heat stability and a uniform color in comminuted (ground or minced) meat.

## What foods contain Red 2G?
Before its suspension in the EU, Red 2G was authorized mainly for certain sausages and burger meat mixtures.[^1] Because authorization was withdrawn, products on the EU market should no longer contain it.[^1] In the U.S., it has never been an approved food color, so you should not find it in American foods.[^3]

## What can replace Red 2G?
- Plant-based reds such as [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red)
- Animal-derived reds such as [cochineal](/e120-cochineal)
- Synthetic reds like [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r) or [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red)

The best substitute depends on the food, the desired shade, heat stability, and labeling needs (for example, whether a vegan or “no artificial colors” claim is required).

## How is Red 2G made?
Red 2G is a man‑made “azo” dye. Azo dyes are synthetic colorants that contain an azo bond (–N=N–) linking two aromatic rings.[^2] Red 2G is not naturally derived.

## Is Red 2G safe to eat?
In 2007, the European Commission suspended the authorization of Red 2G (E128) for use in foods, following new risk assessments.[^1] EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) concluded that Red 2G is readily converted in the body to aniline, and that a genotoxic and carcinogenic risk from that metabolite could not be excluded; as a result, the previous acceptable daily intake was withdrawn.[^2] In the United States, Red 2G is not listed among color additives permitted for use in food.[^3]

## Does Red 2G have any benefits?
Benefits are cosmetic only: it adds or restores a red color and helps keep that color stable during cooking. It does not provide nutritional value.

## Who should avoid Red 2G?
- Consumers in regions where it is not permitted (EU, U.S.) generally will not encounter it in legal food products.
- If you avoid synthetic azo dyes for personal or medical reasons, choosing products colored with natural alternatives like [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red) may better fit your needs.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: An E‑number means a food is unsafe. Fact: An E‑number is just an EU identifier; some additives keep approval, others lose it if new evidence emerges, as happened with Red 2G in 2007.[^1]
- Myth: Red 2G is still common in Europe. Fact: Its authorization was suspended in the EU, so it should not appear in compliant products.[^1]
- Myth: All azo dyes are banned. Fact: Regulatory status varies by dye and region; decisions are made case by case.[^2]

## Red 2G in branded foods
After the EU suspension and in the absence of U.S. approval, major brands in these markets do not use Red 2G. If you are checking older products or imports from other regions, read the ingredient list for “Red 2G” or “E128.”
