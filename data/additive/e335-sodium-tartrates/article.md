Sodium tartrates (E335) are the sodium salts of L(+)-tartaric acid. They help control acidity and bind trace metals in foods, which keeps flavors, colors, and textures stable. In the EU, E335 is an approved additive used across many food categories at defined levels.

## At a glance
- Name: Sodium tartrates (E335)
- What it does: acidity regulator, metal-ion binder (sequestrant), stabiliser
- Where it’s found: a range of processed foods and drinks that need controlled acidity or protection against discoloration
- Made by: neutralising [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid){.additive} with sodium bases
- Safety: evaluated by EU authorities; only the L(+) form is allowed in food

## Why is sodium tartrates added to food?
Food makers use sodium tartrates to keep acidity in the right range and to buffer pH so it stays steady during storage and heating. As a sequestrant, it ties up metal ions such as iron and copper that can speed up spoilage, cause off-flavors, or lead to color changes.[^1] In EU law, E335 is listed as a food additive with specifications defining its identity and purity for these functions.[^2]

## What foods contain sodium tartrates?
You may find E335 in products where a stable, mild acidity is important or where trace metals could harm quality—for example, flavored drinks, confectionery, jams and jellies, canned or jarred foods, and baked goods. In the EU, sodium tartrates are authorized for use in a range of categories under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and its implementing measures.[^3] On labels, it can appear as “E335,” “sodium tartrates,” “monosodium tartrate,” or “disodium tartrate.”

## What can replace sodium tartrates?
Possible substitutes depend on the job you need done:
- For acidity control or buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}, [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid){.additive}, or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive}.
- For metal-ion control (sequestration): [sodium polyphosphate](/e452i-sodium-polyphosphate){.additive}, other [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates){.additive}, or calcium disodium EDTA ([E385](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate){.additive}).[^1]

## How is sodium tartrates made?
Sodium tartrates are produced by neutralising [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid){.additive} with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, yielding mono- and/or disodium salts. EU specifications require the L(+)-isomer and set purity criteria, including limits for contaminants and by-products.[^2]

## Is sodium tartrates safe to eat?
EU experts have reevaluated tartaric acid and its salts (including E335) and concluded there is no safety concern at the currently authorized uses and levels, provided only the L(+)-isomer is used.[^1] The additive also has legally defined specifications and use conditions in EU law.[^2][^3]

## Does sodium tartrates have any benefits?
In addition to setting and holding pH, E335 can:
- Protect flavors and colors by binding metal ions that catalyze oxidation
- Improve stability of some gels and textures by keeping the ionic environment consistent
These effects help maintain quality during shelf life and heat processing.[^1]

## Who should avoid sodium tartrates?
- People on medically prescribed low-sodium diets may wish to monitor total sodium from all sources, including additives.
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to tartrates should avoid them. Such reactions are uncommon but possible, as with many food acids and salts.
If you have specific dietary needs, check product labels for “E335” or “sodium tartrates.”

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as cream of tartar.” Not quite. Cream of tartar is potassium bitartrate, which is [E336(i)](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate){.additive}. Sodium tartrates are different salts of the same acid.
- “It’s only a souring agent.” Sodium tartrates can add tang, but they are mainly used to buffer pH and to bind metals that cause quality loss.[^1]
- “All tartrates are allowed.” EU rules permit only the L(+)-tartaric acid salts for food use, with clear purity specs.[^2]

## Sodium tartrates in branded foods
On ingredient lists you might see:
- E-number: “E335”
- Names: “sodium tartrates,” “monosodium tartrate,” “disodium tartrate”
These may appear in beverages, sweets, fruit spreads, bakery items, and preserved foods where acidity and color stability matter. Always check the label for the exact name or E-number.
