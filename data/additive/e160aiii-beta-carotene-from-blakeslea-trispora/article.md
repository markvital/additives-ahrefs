Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora (E160AIII) is an orange-yellow food color made by fermenting the filamentous fungus Blakeslea trispora. It gives foods a natural-looking carrot or orange hue and is widely used in drinks, dairy, and bakery items. It is approved in the U.S. and EU and considered safe at normal use levels.

## At a glance
- What it is: A carotenoid color made by fermentation of Blakeslea trispora.
- E-number: E160AIII (a form of beta-carotene).
- Function: Food color (adds yellow to orange shades).
- Appearance: Deep orange crystals or oil-based dispersions; oil-soluble.
- Typical uses: Soft drinks, juices, yogurts, margarine, ice cream, baked goods, confectionery.
- Dietary notes: Usually suitable for vegetarians and vegans when standardized in plant oils; check the label for carriers and emulsifiers.

## Why is Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora added to food?
Food makers use this additive to create warm yellow-to-orange colors that consumers expect in fruit drinks, dairy desserts, margarine, and many snacks. It is relatively stable in processing and storage when protected from oxygen and light, especially in oil-based forms or when antioxidants such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid){.additive} or [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol){.additive} are present. It can replace or reduce the need for synthetic dyes while delivering a familiar, “from plants” look and label.

## What foods contain Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Beverages: fruit drinks, flavored waters, and soft drinks
- Dairy and alternatives: yogurts, ice cream, custards, margarine and spreads
- Bakery and cereals: cakes, biscuits, breakfast cereals
- Confectionery: gummies, coated sweets, chewing gum
- Sauces and prepared foods: soups, dressings, and ready meals

On labels, it may appear as “beta-carotene,” “E160a,” or “beta-carotene (Blakeslea trispora).”

## What can replace Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora?
Alternatives depend on the target shade, processing, and label goals:
- Other carotenoids: [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene){.additive} (synthetic), [plant carotenes](/e160aii-plant-carotenes){.additive}, [algal carotenes](/e160aiv-algal-carotenes){.additive}, [lutein](/e161b-lutein){.additive}, [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene){.additive}
- Spice and plant colors: [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}, [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive}
- Formulation aids for beverages: emulsified or encapsulated forms using carriers like [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum){.additive} or [starch sodium octenyl succinate](/e1450-starch-sodium-octenyl-succinate){.additive} to keep the color evenly dispersed

## How is Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora made?
Manufacturers ferment selected, mated strains of the fungus Blakeslea trispora under controlled conditions to build up beta-carotene. The carotenoid is then extracted, purified, and typically standardized in vegetable oil or made into dispersions with permitted carriers and antioxidants to improve stability and ease of use in foods.[^2]

EU specifications define identity and purity requirements for E160a(iii), including how the material is produced by fermentation and what processing aids and carriers are acceptable for the final additive placed on the market.[^2]

## Is Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the United States, beta-carotene is a listed color additive exempt from certification and may be used in foods in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, E160a(iii) is authorized; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated beta-carotene (E160a) and found no safety concern at the reported use levels in foods.[^3]

Beta-carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid, and the body converts it to vitamin A as needed. This self-limiting conversion helps reduce the risk of vitamin A toxicity from typical dietary intakes.[^4]

## Does Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora have any benefits?
Its main role in foods is color. However, beta-carotene can act as a source of vitamin A because the body can convert it to retinol as needed, supporting normal vision and immune function. In regular foods, the amounts added for coloring are small and should not be relied upon to meet vitamin A needs.[^4]

## Who should avoid Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora?
- People taking high-dose beta-carotene supplements, especially smokers or those exposed to asbestos, should avoid those supplements. A large clinical trial in male smokers found an increased risk of lung cancer with high-dose beta-carotene supplementation; this does not apply to typical food-use levels but is relevant to supplement choices.[^6]
- Anyone with specific dietary restrictions should check labels for carriers or emulsifiers that may not fit their diet.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: All beta-carotene in food is synthetic. Fact: E160AIII is made by fermentation of a fungus, though other approved sources include plant, algal, and synthetic forms.
- Myth: Beta-carotene color makes foods high in vitamin A. Fact: Coloring levels are low; beta-carotene can contribute to vitamin A, but not usually in meaningful amounts from color use.
- Myth: Natural colors are always unstable. Fact: Modern oil-dispersed or encapsulated forms are designed to be stable in many foods, especially when protected with antioxidants like [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol){.additive}.

## Beta-carotene from blakeslea trispora in branded foods
To spot it on labels, look for “beta-carotene,” “E160a,” or “beta-carotene (Blakeslea trispora).” Some products list the specific form or give the E-number. In beverages and dairy, it may appear in the ingredients together with carriers or emulsifiers that keep the color evenly mixed.
