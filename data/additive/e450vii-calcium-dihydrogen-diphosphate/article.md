Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate (E450VII) is a calcium salt of pyrophosphate used mainly as a leavening acid and dough conditioner. It helps baked goods rise evenly and keeps texture stable during mixing, freezing, and baking. You may also see it called calcium acid pyrophosphate on ingredient lists.

## At a glance
- E-number: E450VII (a member of the diphosphates group)
- Other names: calcium dihydrogen diphosphate, calcium acid pyrophosphate, E450vii
- What it does: leavening acid, stabiliser, sequestrant (binds metals), and texture aid
- Where it’s used: baking powder, self-rising flour, cakes, biscuits, pancakes, tortillas, frozen doughs
- Label note: mineral-based; typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans
- Often paired with: a base like [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)

## Why is Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate added to food?
Bakers use it as a leavening acid. When it reacts with a base such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate), carbon dioxide forms and makes batter or dough rise. Its reaction can be controlled to give lift during mixing and again in the oven, improving crumb and volume.

It also helps keep mixtures stable. As a stabiliser and “sequestrant” (a substance that binds metal ions like iron and copper), it can protect color and flavor, and support even texture in processed foods. Regulators group phosphate additives as raising agents, acidity regulators, stabilisers, and sequestrants.[^1]

## What foods contain Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Baking powder and self-rising flour
- Cake, muffin, pancake, and waffle mixes
- Biscuits, cookies, doughnuts, and batter-coated foods
- Shelf-stable tortillas and flatbreads
- Refrigerated or frozen doughs that need steady, delayed leavening

It may also appear with other phosphate salts in processed foods to manage texture and moisture.

## What can replace Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate?
Possible substitutes depend on the recipe and desired rise time:
- Faster leavening acids: [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate)
- Heat-activated acids for oven spring: [acid sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541i-acid-sodium-aluminium-phosphate)
- Other acids with different flavor/kinetics: [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone) or cream of tartar ([monopotassium tartrate](/e336i-monopotassium-tartrate))
- Other diphosphates in blends: [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate)

Note that swapping acids changes how quickly gas is released, which can affect taste, spread, and texture.

## How is Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate made?
In practice, manufacturers start with food-grade phosphorus sources (such as [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)) and a calcium source. The mixture is neutralized and then heated so part of the phosphate units join to form a “diphosphate” (also called pyrophosphate). This yields calcium dihydrogen diphosphate as a fine, white powder.

In the European Union, it is listed as “calcium dihydrogen diphosphate (acid calcium pyrophosphate)” under E 450(vii), with purity specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for all phosphate additives of 40 mg/kg body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus (P). EFSA also noted that some population groups could exceed this level depending on diet.[^1] ADI means the amount that can be eaten daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists calcium acid pyrophosphate among regulated or generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additives when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

As with all phosphate salts, overall phosphorus intake matters. Very high phosphorus intakes can upset mineral balance, especially for people with kidney problems.[^4]

## Does Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate have any benefits?
- Reliable rise: Provides controlled leavening for consistent volume and crumb.
- Texture help: Supports dough stability through mixing, holding, and baking.
- Calcium source: Being a calcium salt, it can contribute some calcium to recipes.
- Lower sodium swaps: Useful when formulating reduced-sodium baked goods compared with sodium-only acids.

## Who should avoid Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or anyone told to limit phosphorus should be cautious with phosphate additives, including this one.[^4]
- Individuals advised by a health professional to follow a low-phosphate diet.
- If you are managing your phosphorus intake, check labels for “phosphate,” “diphosphate,” “pyrophosphate,” or E-numbers E338–E452, including E450VII.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All phosphates are the same.” Fact: There are many phosphate additives with different roles, from [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates) to [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates) and [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates).
- Myth: “It contains aluminum.” Fact: Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate does not contain aluminum; you’ll see aluminum only in additives labeled with aluminium/aluminum in the name (for example, [acid sodium aluminium phosphate](/e541i-acid-sodium-aluminium-phosphate)).
- Myth: “It’s just a preservative.” Fact: Its primary role is leavening and texture control, not preservation.

## Calcium dihydrogen diphosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “calcium dihydrogen diphosphate,” “calcium acid pyrophosphate,” “E450,” or “E450(vii).” You’ll commonly see it in:
- Baking powders and self-rising flours
- Pancake and cake mixes
- Refrigerated biscuit doughs and frozen bakery items
- Packaged tortillas and flatbreads

It often appears alongside a base such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) and may be blended with other leavening acids like [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate).
