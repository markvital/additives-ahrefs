Glyceryl triacetate (E1518), also called triacetin, is a clear, nearly odorless liquid used in foods mainly as a carrier for flavors and to help keep moisture and texture. It blends flavor ingredients evenly and helps them stay stable during processing and storage.

## At a glance
- What it is: an ester made from [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) and [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), also known as triacetin or glycerin triacetate.
- What it does: works as a carrier/solvent for flavors, a humectant to hold moisture, and a texture helper; also used as a plasticizer in chewing gum base.
- Where it’s found: flavor preparations for beverages, candies, icings, baked goods, and chewing gum.
- Appearance and taste: colorless liquid with little to no taste or smell.

## Why is Glyceryl triacetate added to food?
Food makers use glyceryl triacetate because it dissolves and carries flavor compounds, helping them mix evenly into foods and drinks and remain stable over time.^[^1] It can also hold moisture (humectant action) and improve texture in some products. In chewing gum, it softens the gum base so the chew stays flexible and smooth.^[^3]

## What foods contain Glyceryl triacetate?
You’ll most often find it:
- In flavor preparations used for soft drinks, confectionery, icings, and baked goods, where it acts as a solvent/carrier for the flavors.^[^1]
- In chewing gum, as part of the gum base to keep it soft and pliable.^[^3]

Because it is often part of a flavor preparation, it may appear on labels near flavoring ingredients or listed as “triacetin,” “glyceryl triacetate,” or “E1518.”

## What can replace Glyceryl triacetate?
Depending on the job it does in the recipe, formulators may use:
- Other carriers/solvents for flavors: [ethanol](/e1510-ethanol), [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol)
- Plasticizers/humectants or emulsifiers: [triethyl citrate](/e1505-triethyl-citrate), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins)

The best substitute depends on the flavor system, labeling goals, and the texture or moisture target.

## How is Glyceryl triacetate made?
Glyceryl triacetate is produced by reacting [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) with [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid) or acetic anhydride to form the triester, followed by purification to meet food-grade specifications.^[^2]

## Is Glyceryl triacetate safe to eat?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms triacetin (glyceryl triacetate) as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for direct addition to food at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.^[^1] It is also specifically allowed as a component of chewing gum base.^[^3] In the body, triacetin is quickly broken down (hydrolyzed) to glycerol and acetate—substances that are normal parts of human metabolism.^[^4]

## Does Glyceryl triacetate have any benefits?
For consumers, its benefits are mostly about quality, not nutrition:
- Helps flavors dissolve, blend, and stay consistent across batches.
- Supports moisture retention and soft, smooth textures (notably in chewing gum).
- Has very little taste or odor, so it doesn’t mask or distort flavors.

## Who should avoid Glyceryl triacetate?
Regulators have not identified specific groups that need to avoid glyceryl triacetate when it is used as intended. If you have a medical reason to limit acetate or glycerol intake, or you follow a diet that restricts certain additives, ask your healthcare provider for guidance.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a plasticizer, so it must be a phthalate.” False. Glyceryl triacetate is a simple acetate ester of glycerol, not a phthalate.
- “It’s the same as glycerol.” False. Triacetin is an ester of glycerol; the body can convert it back to glycerol and acetate, but they are not the same ingredient.^[^4]
- “It’s used in large amounts.” Generally false. As a carrier or processing aid, it is typically used at low levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.^[^1]

## Glyceryl triacetate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “glyceryl triacetate,” “triacetin,” or “E1518.” It may appear:
- In flavored beverages, candies, baked goods, and desserts as part of flavor preparations
- In chewing gum, as part of the gum base or near flavoring ingredients
