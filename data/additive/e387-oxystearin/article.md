Oxystearin (E387) is an oxidized form of the fatty acid stearic acid that has been used as an antioxidant and stabilizer in fats and oils. It is uncommon on today’s ingredient lists and is not widely authorized across major markets.

## At a glance
- Additive name: Oxystearin
- E-number: E387
- What it does: Antioxidant and texture stabilizer for fats and oils
- Where you might see it: Historically in edible oils, shortenings, and margarine-type products; now rare
- Label names: “Oxystearin” or “E387”
- Dietary notes: Derived from stearic acid, which can come from vegetable or animal fats
- Regulatory note: Authorization varies by country; in the EU it is not on the current Union list

## Why is Oxystearin added to food?
Manufacturers add antioxidants to fats and oils to slow rancidity. Rancidity happens when oxygen reacts with fatty acids, creating off-flavors and odors. Oxystearin was used to help keep oils, shortenings, and fat-rich foods stable during storage and heating.

## What foods contain Oxystearin?
You are unlikely to find E387 on modern ingredient lists. If present, it would most likely appear in refined fats and oils, frying shortenings, or fat-rich spreads.

In the European Union (EU), only additives on the Union list in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 may be used in foods placed on the market.[^1] Oxystearin (E387) is not listed with specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which sets the official specifications for permitted additives.[^2]

## What can replace Oxystearin?
Several permitted antioxidants and synergists can serve similar roles in fats and oils:
- Natural-source antioxidants such as [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)
- Synthetic antioxidants like [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Fat-soluble vitamin C derivatives such as [ascorbyl palmitate](/e304i-ascorbyl-palmitate)
- Chelators and acidulants that slow oxidation, for example [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) in appropriate applications

The best choice depends on the food, process, and local regulations.

## How is Oxystearin made?
Oxystearin is produced from stearic acid (a common 18‑carbon saturated fatty acid) through controlled oxidation. This creates a waxy mixture of oxygenated stearic acid derivatives that disperses in fats and oils and can help slow oxidation during storage and heating.

## Is Oxystearin safe to eat?
Safety and use depend on regulatory approval in each country:
- European Union: Food additives must be listed in the Union list under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 to be used; E387 is not on that list.[^1] It also does not have specifications under Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]
- United States: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows only approved food additives or substances that are “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS). The FDA maintains a public Food Additive Status List as a quick reference for current authorizations.[^3]
- International reference: The Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) outlines permitted additives by food category and is used by many countries when setting national rules.[^4]

Always check your local regulations; if an additive is not authorized, it should not be used in foods sold in that market.

## Does Oxystearin have any benefits?
- For food quality: Helps delay rancidity in fats and oils, which can reduce off-flavors and extend shelf life.
- For nutrition: No direct nutritional benefits are known; its purpose is technological, not dietary.

## Who should avoid Oxystearin?
- Strict vegetarians, vegans, and some faith-based diets may wish to avoid it unless the source of stearic acid (plant vs. animal) is confirmed.
- People following specific additive-avoidance diets should read labels carefully and consult local rules.
- As with any fat-soluble additive, those advised to limit certain processed fats should consider the overall product, not just the additive.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Oxystearin is the same as stearic acid.” Fact: It is derived from stearic acid but is an oxidized mixture with different properties.
- Myth: “It’s a trans fat.” Fact: Oxystearin is not a trans-fat; it functions as an antioxidant/stabilizer in fats.
- Myth: “If it has an E‑number, it’s allowed everywhere.” Fact: E‑numbers are used in Europe, but only additives on the current EU Union list may be used in foods sold in the EU.[^1]

## Oxystearin in branded foods
Because it is not included in the current EU Union list or EU specifications, you should not see E387 on food labels in the European Union.[^1][^2] In other markets, always check the ingredient list—if present, it would appear as “oxystearin” or “E387,” subject to local labelling rules.[^3]
