Paprika extract (E160c) is a natural color made from red peppers (Capsicum annuum). It gives foods warm orange to deep red shades with little to no taste at typical use levels. You’ll see it in snacks, sauces, soups, cheeses, and more as a simple way to make foods look appetizing.

## At a glance
- What it is: a color made from peppers; main pigments are capsanthin and capsorubin
- What it does: adds orange–red color with minimal flavor
- Typical foods: chips, noodles, dressings, sauces, processed meats, cheeses, plant-based foods
- Label names: “paprika extract,” “paprika oleoresin,” or “paprika (for color)”
- Dietary notes: plant-derived; usually suitable for vegetarians and vegans
- Regulations: permitted as a food color in both the U.S. and EU
- Formats: oil-soluble or water-dispersible preparations for easy mixing

## Why is Paprika extract added to food?
Color matters to how we judge freshness, flavor, and quality. Paprika extract provides a stable orange–red hue that helps products look consistent from batch to batch. In the U.S., paprika oleoresin is a color additive “exempt from certification,” meaning it doesn’t need synthetic dye certification because it is derived from a natural source and must meet identity and purity rules.[^1] FDA also lists it among color additives permitted for use in foods under good manufacturing practice.[^2] It is likewise authorised as a food color in the European Union under the general food additives regulation.[^3]

## What foods contain Paprika extract?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Snack foods such as flavored chips, crackers, and popcorn
- Instant noodles, rice mixes, and meal kits
- Salad dressings, mayonnaise, and dips
- Soups, sauces, and condiments like ketchup or chili sauce
- Sausages, deli meats, and meat alternatives
- Cheeses and cheese spreads
- Breakfast cereals, bakery glazes, and confectionery coatings
- Ready meals and plant-based analogues

## What can replace Paprika extract?
Depending on the shade and the recipe, formulators may use:
- Yellow–orange carotenoids like [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene){.additive} or [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive}
- Orange–red carotenoids such as [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive} or [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene){.additive}
- Red options like [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive}
- Brown hues from [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive}
Each color behaves differently with heat, light, pH, and fats, so the best substitute depends on the food and desired shade.

## How is Paprika extract made?
Paprika extract (often called “paprika oleoresin”) is obtained by extracting ground Capsicum annuum peppers with food-grade solvents, then concentrating the pigments and diluting them in an edible oil for consistent coloring. U.S. regulations describe the identity of paprika oleoresin and list permitted extraction solvents such as ethanol and hexane, along with required processing and purity criteria.[^1] Manufacturers also prepare water-dispersible forms by blending the oleoresin with carriers and emulsifiers so it mixes easily into watery foods.

## Is Paprika extract safe to eat?
When used as intended, paprika extract is considered safe by major regulators. In the U.S., it’s an approved color additive for foods when used in line with good manufacturing practice and the listing’s identity and purity specifications.[^2] In the EU, it is on the Union list of authorized food additives and must meet detailed composition and purity specifications (for example, limits for contaminants).[^3][^4]

## Does Paprika extract have any benefits?
Paprika extract is added for its color, not as a nutrient. It can help products look uniform and appetizing, and in some recipes it may subtly round out a savory profile. Unlike some carotenoids, its main pigments (capsanthin and capsorubin) are not used to deliver vitamin A.

## Who should avoid Paprika extract?
- People with allergies or sensitivities to peppers (Capsicum species) should avoid it.
- If your doctor has advised you to avoid certain color additives or spices, check labels for “paprika extract,” “paprika oleoresin,” or “paprika (for color).”
- For very strict elimination diets, consult a clinician or dietitian before excluding colored foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Paprika extract makes food spicy. Fact: At typical levels it contributes color with little to no heat.
- Myth: It’s an artificial dye. Fact: It’s derived from peppers and regulated as a color additive.
- Myth: It adds vitamin A like beta-carotene. Fact: It’s used for color; its main pigments are not provitamin A.
- Myth: It always tastes smoky. Fact: The extract itself is not smoked; any smoky taste comes from other ingredients.

## Paprika extract in branded foods
On ingredient lists, paprika color may appear as:
- Paprika extract
- Paprika oleoresin
- Paprika (for color) or “colored with paprika”
Placement varies by product, but it often sits near spices or other colors. The actual shade can range from orange to deep red, depending on the formulation and dose.
