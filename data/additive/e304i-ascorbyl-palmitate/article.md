Ascorbyl palmitate (E304i) is a fat‑soluble form of vitamin C made by joining ascorbic acid to palmitic acid. Food makers use it as an antioxidant to keep fats and oils from turning rancid, helping protect flavor, color, and nutrients during shelf life. It’s approved in the EU as E‑number E304i and is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the United States.

## At a glance
- What it is: An antioxidant made from vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and palmitic acid that dissolves in fats and oils.
- What it does: Slows oxidation to help keep foods from going stale or developing off‑flavors.
- Where you’ll find it: Fried snacks, roasted nuts, bakery fats and fillings, margarines and spreads, sauces, and some fortified foods and supplements.
- How it looks: White to off‑white powder, nearly odorless, with little taste at normal use levels.
- Label names: “Ascorbyl palmitate,” “L‑ascorbyl palmitate,” sometimes “antioxidant (E304i).”

## Why is Ascorbyl palmitate added to food?
Food fats and oils can react with oxygen and break down. Ascorbyl palmitate helps block this process, so foods keep their taste and color longer, and sensitive nutrients are better protected.[^1] Because it dissolves in fat, it can safeguard the oil phase where water‑soluble antioxidants like [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) do not work as well.[^1]

## What foods contain Ascorbyl palmitate?
You’ll most often see it in foods with meaningful fat or oil: snack chips, crackers, dry‑roasted nuts, cereal and bakery coatings, chocolate fillings, margarine and spreads, dressings and sauces, and some powdered mixes with added fats. It is also used in certain food supplements and specialty products where oxidation needs control, as allowed under EU food additive rules.[^3]

## What can replace Ascorbyl palmitate?
- Other antioxidants: [tocopherol‑rich extract (mixed vitamin E)](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [alpha‑tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), and [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq).
- Natural extracts: [rosemary extracts](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary).
- Synergists and helpers: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) can help control metals that speed oxidation; [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) can improve dispersion in fats.
The best choice depends on the food’s fat type, flavor goals, labeling needs, and processing conditions.

## How is Ascorbyl palmitate made?
It is produced by esterifying vitamin C (L‑ascorbic acid) with palmitic acid to form a fat‑soluble antioxidant. Food‑grade material is made under controlled conditions so it meets purity and performance specifications for use in foods.[^2]

## Is Ascorbyl palmitate safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, ascorbyl palmitate is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as an antioxidant in foods.[^1] In Europe, it is an authorized additive (E304i); EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, re‑evaluated E304i and did not identify safety concerns at reported uses and use levels.[^2] Its use is covered by the EU’s food additive regulation framework.[^3]

## Does Ascorbyl palmitate have any benefits?
For consumers, the main benefit is better‑tasting products for longer: fewer rancid notes, slower color fade, and improved freshness during shelf life. For manufacturers, it is valued because it works in the fat phase and pairs well with other antioxidants like [alpha‑tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol) to boost overall protection.

## Who should avoid Ascorbyl palmitate?
Most people do not need to avoid it. If you have been told to avoid vitamin C derivatives or specific additives, have unusual sensitivities, or follow strict ingredient policies for personal or religious reasons, check product labels and ask the brand about sourcing and processing.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s just vitamin C.” Not exactly. It’s a vitamin C derivative designed to work in fats, so it behaves differently in foods.
- “It makes food oily.” No. It is used at very low levels and does not make foods taste greasy.
- “It’s only for processed snacks.” It’s used wherever fats need protection—from nuts and baked goods to spreads and some fortified foods.

## Ascorbyl palmitate in branded foods
On packaging, look for “ascorbyl palmitate,” “L‑ascorbyl palmitate,” or “antioxidant (E304i).” In U.S. products it may appear without the E‑number; in EU products the E‑number is often shown alongside the name.
