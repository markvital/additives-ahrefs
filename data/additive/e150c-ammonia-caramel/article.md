Ammonia caramel (E150c) is a dark brown food color made by heating sugars with ammonium compounds. It gives a stable, appealing brown shade to drinks and foods, especially colas, sauces, and baked goods. Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow its use when it meets strict specifications.

## At a glance
- Also called E150c, baker’s caramel, confectioner’s caramel, and beer caramel
- Purpose: water‑soluble brown color for drinks and foods
- Common in colas, beers, sauces, gravies, and baked goods
- Made by heating sugars in the presence of ammonium compounds
- Regulated in both the U.S. and EU; manufacturing controls limit by‑products like 4‑MEI (4‑methylimidazole)
- May appear on labels as “caramel color,” “caramel (class III),” or “E150c”

## Why is Ammonia caramel added to food?
Food makers use E150c to create consistent brown tones, from light amber to deep cola brown. It dissolves well in water and holds its color in acidic, salty, and heat‑processed foods, which is why it works in soft drinks, syrups, and cooked sauces.

## What foods contain Ammonia caramel?
You’ll most often see it in cola‑style soft drinks, beers and malt beverages, brown sauces and gravies, savory snacks, breakfast cereals, candies, and baked goods. In the U.S., “caramel” is a color additive exempt from certification and may be used in foods at levels needed to achieve color, following good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, E150c is an authorized food color with detailed identity and purity specifications laid down in law.[^2]

## What can replace Ammonia caramel?
- Other caramel classes, chosen for process or flavor needs:
  - [plain caramel (E150a)](/e150a-plain-caramel)
  - [caustic sulphite caramel (E150b)](/e150b-caustic-sulphite-caramel)
  - [sulphite ammonia caramel (E150d)](/e150d-sulphite-ammonia-caramel)
- Non‑caramel colors for brown/amber shades:
  - [annatto (E160b)](/e160b-annatto) for yellow‑orange tones
  - [vegetable carbon (E153)](/e153-vegetable-carbon) for near‑black
  - [anthocyanins (E163)](/e163-anthocyanins) blended for red‑brown hues
Choice depends on the target shade, flavor neutrality, label goals, and process conditions.

## How is Ammonia caramel made?
Manufacturers heat carbohydrates (such as glucose or sucrose) with ammonium compounds (for example, ammonium hydroxide) to trigger controlled browning and polymer formation. U.S. regulations describe “caramel” as the brown material from controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates with or without certain acids, alkalis, and salts, and list ammonium compounds among the permitted reactants.[^1] In the EU, the class III process (ammonia caramel) and its composition are defined in binding specifications, which also include limits for process by‑products like 4‑MEI (4‑methylimidazole).[^2]

## Is Ammonia caramel safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits caramel color in foods and has stated that current levels of 4‑MEI in caramel‑colored foods do not pose a risk that would require consumers to change their diets.[^3] In Europe, EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) has re‑evaluated caramel colors (E150a–d) and concluded that exposure at authorized uses does not raise safety concerns, with acceptable daily intakes set for the different classes.[^4] EU specifications also cap certain impurities, including 4‑MEI, as an added safety margin.[^2]

## Does Ammonia caramel have any benefits?
Its benefit is visual: it standardizes and stabilizes brown color so foods and drinks look the same from batch to batch. It does not add meaningful nutrition or sweetness and is used at very low levels.

## Who should avoid Ammonia caramel?
- People following personal or medical advice to limit caramel‑colored soft drinks may wish to choose alternatives.
- Those sensitive to sulfites should know that E150c is made via the ammonia process (without sulfites), unlike some other caramel classes; always check the label to be sure which class is used.[^2]
- If you are managing overall added‑sugar intake, remember that the color itself is not sugar, but the foods that use it (like sodas) may be.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Caramel color always contains dangerous levels of 4‑MEI.” Fact: FDA monitoring indicates 4‑MEI levels found in foods do not require dietary changes, and manufacturers can control levels through processing.[^3]
- Myth: “Caramel color isn’t regulated.” Fact: It’s regulated in the U.S. as a color additive exempt from certification and must meet identity and safety requirements.[^1]
- Myth: “EU rules don’t address impurities.” Fact: The EU sets binding specifications for E150c, including limits for by‑products like 4‑MEI.[^2]
- Myth: “EFSA flagged caramel colors as unsafe.” Fact: EFSA re‑evaluated E150a–d and concluded no safety concern at authorized uses, establishing ADIs for the classes.[^4]

## Ammonia caramel in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “caramel color,” “caramel (class III),” or “E150c” (common in the EU). The exact class may or may not be stated on U.S. labels. If you want to avoid a specific class, check brand product pages or contact the manufacturer for details.
