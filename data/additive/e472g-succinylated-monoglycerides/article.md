Succinylated monoglycerides (E472g) are emulsifiers made by attaching parts of succinic acid to monoglycerides from edible fats and oils. They help oil and water mix, steady foams, and keep textures consistent in foods like baked goods and whipped toppings.
They are approved for specific uses in the United States and have official specifications in the European Union.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier made by reacting monoglycerides with succinic compounds
- Also called: E472g, succinylated monoglycerides
- What it does: helps oil and water blend, stabilizes foams, improves dough handling and sliceability
- Where it’s found: breads and baked mixes, non-dairy creamers, whipped toppings, sauces, and shortenings
- Regulation: permitted for specified uses in the U.S. and listed with specifications in the EU
- Labeling: appears as “succinylated monoglycerides” or “E472g” (EU/UK); the fat source may be plant- or animal-derived, so check with manufacturers if that matters to you

## Why is Succinylated monoglycerides added to food?
Food makers use succinylated monoglycerides (often shortened to SMG) as emulsifiers, which are ingredients that help oil and water stay mixed. By adding extra acid groups from succinic acid, SMG becomes more water-friendly than plain monoglycerides, so it can stabilize emulsions, foams, and batters more effectively. In practice, this supports even crumb structure in baked goods, prevents oiling-off in toppings, and improves freeze–thaw stability in some formulations.[^1]

## What foods contain Succinylated monoglycerides?
You’ll most often see SMG in:
- Baked goods and baking mixes (bread, rolls, cakes)
- Oils and shortenings
- Whipped toppings and dessert foams
- Beverage bases and non-dairy creamers
- Sauces and similar emulsified foods

In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows succinylated monoglycerides as an emulsifier in specific categories such as oils and shortenings, baked goods and mixes, beverage bases, toppings, and related foods, with maximum use levels defined by regulation.[^1] In the European Union (EU), E472g is listed with official identity and purity specifications and carries its E-number on labels where used under the EU food additive rules.[^2][^3]

## What can replace Succinylated monoglycerides?
Depending on the recipe and the job to be done (emulsifying, aeration, or crumb softening), possible alternatives include:
- Other emulsifiers based on glycerides, such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or their esters like [lactic acid esters](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive} and [mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}
- Natural options like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}
- Other process-friendly emulsifiers like [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate){.additive}
- For viscosity or stabilization (not true emulsification), gums such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive} may help, depending on the product

Choosing a substitute depends on pH, fat type, processing steps, and whether you need aeration, emulsification, or crumb conditioning.

## How is Succinylated monoglycerides made?
SMG is produced by reacting monoglycerides (from edible fats and oils) with succinic compounds, typically succinic anhydride. The result is a mixture of succinylated mono- and diglycerides with both fat-loving and water-loving parts, which is why it works as an emulsifier. U.S. regulations specify how it is made and the food-grade purity it must meet, and the EU sets comparable identity and purity specifications.[^1][^2]

## Is Succinylated monoglycerides safe to eat?
When used as permitted, succinylated monoglycerides are considered safe by major regulators. In the U.S., the FDA lists SMG as a direct food additive with defined food categories and maximum use levels; manufacturers must meet identity and purity requirements and follow good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, E472g is part of the food additive framework and must comply with EU specifications and authorisation rules before use in foods.[^2][^3]

## Does Succinylated monoglycerides have any benefits?
Yes. SMG helps oil and water blend smoothly, supports stable foams, and can improve the texture and volume of baked goods. It can also help prevent separation in emulsified foods and reduce staling in some recipes by improving dispersion of fats in the dough or batter.

## Who should avoid Succinylated monoglycerides?
- People who avoid certain sources of fats (for religious, ethical, or dietary reasons) may wish to check the origin of the monoglycerides, as fats and oils can be plant- or animal-derived depending on the manufacturer.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit food additives should follow that guidance.
- If you are highly sensitive to formulation changes, choose products with simpler ingredient lists.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: E472g is the same as MSG. Fact: It is not related to monosodium glutamate; E472g is an emulsifier made from fats and succinic compounds.
- Myth: Emulsifiers “add water” to foods. Fact: Emulsifiers help keep existing water and oil mixed; they do not add water themselves.
- Myth: All emulsifiers are synthetic. Fact: Some, like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}, can be derived from natural sources such as soy or sunflower.

## Succinylated monoglycerides in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “succinylated monoglycerides” or “E472g.” You’ll most commonly find it in sliced bread and rolls, tortillas, cake and baking mixes, whipped toppings, non-dairy creamers, and certain sauces. Availability and naming can vary by country and brand.
