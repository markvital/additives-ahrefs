Sodium formiate (E237), also called sodium formate, is the sodium salt of formic acid. It has been used for its preservative action, but today it is uncommon in foods in many regions. Rules vary by country, so labels and local laws matter.

## At a glance
- What it is: the sodium salt of formic acid, a simple organic acid.
- Main role: antimicrobial preservative potential; keeps microbes from growing.
- Status today: not widely used in foods and not authorised as a food additive in the European Union.
- Common stand-ins: preservatives like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), and [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate).

## Why is Sodium formiate added to food?
Sodium formiate is the sodium salt of formic acid. In simple terms, it is a neutralized form of an acid that can help control microbes. [^1]  
It has antimicrobial properties, which is why similar substances are used to slow spoilage from bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Most practical use of formic acid/formates today is in preservation of feed, not food. [^2]

## What foods contain Sodium formiate?
You are unlikely to see sodium formiate on ingredient lists in the European Union because E237 is not on the Union list of authorised food additives under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. [^3]  
In the United States and many other countries, only additives that have been reviewed and authorized (or found “GRAS,” generally recognized as safe) may be added to foods, so use depends on specific approvals in each market. [^4]

## What can replace Sodium formiate?
Food makers typically choose other, widely authorized preservatives to achieve a similar effect, such as:
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) for many bakery and dairy-style products
- [Sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) for acidic drinks and sauces
- Acidulants like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium acetates](/e262-sodium-acetates) to help limit microbial growth by lowering pH

The best choice depends on food type, target microbes, pH, taste, and label goals.

## How is Sodium formiate made?
Sodium formiate is the sodium salt of formic acid and can be prepared by neutralizing formic acid with a sodium base (for example, sodium hydroxide). This straightforward acid–base reaction produces the salt and water. [^1]

## Is Sodium formiate safe to eat?
Food additives are only allowed after a safety review and authorization by regulators. In the EU, sodium formiate (E237) is not on the current Union list of approved food additives, so it is not permitted for use as a food additive there. [^3] In the U.S., additives must be approved or determined GRAS for their intended uses before they appear in foods, and manufacturers are responsible for compliance. [^4]  
If you have questions about a specific product, check the ingredient list or contact the maker.

## Does Sodium formiate have any benefits?
In principle, sodium formiate can help inhibit the growth of unwanted microbes, which is why related substances are used as preservatives. Today, this function is mainly supported in animal feed applications rather than foods. [^2]

## Who should avoid Sodium formiate?
- People on a sodium-restricted diet should watch for all sodium-based ingredients in general, since total sodium intake matters for blood pressure. [^5]  
- Anyone with specific medical advice to limit certain additives should follow their clinician’s guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “If an additive has an E‑number, it is always allowed in the EU.”  
  Fact: E‑numbers are identification codes. Some numbers refer to additives that are no longer authorised for food use in the EU.
- Myth: “All preservatives are harsh chemicals.”  
  Fact: Some preservatives are familiar substances such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) that occur in nature; safety depends on dose and context.
- Myth: “If it’s not common in foods, it must be unsafe.”  
  Fact: Lack of use can reflect regulatory choices, effectiveness, taste impact, label goals, or better alternatives—not just safety.

## Sodium formiate in branded foods
Sodium formiate is rarely seen on modern ingredient lists, especially in the EU. If you think you’ve found it in a product, look for the names “sodium formiate,” “sodium formate,” or “E237” on the label, and ask the manufacturer for details about where the product is sold and which regulations apply.
