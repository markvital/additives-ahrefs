Hydroxypropyl cellulose (E463) is a modified plant fiber used to make foods smooth, stable, and creamy. It acts as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier, and can also form clear, flexible films on foods. It is widely approved for use in many countries and is considered safe at typical food levels.

## At a glance
- What it is: a cellulose ether made from plant cellulose with added hydroxypropyl groups
- What it does: thickens, stabilises, emulsifies, and forms films; helps texture and shelf-life
- Where it’s found: sauces, dressings, baked fillings, dairy-style desserts, confectionery, beverages
- Dietary notes: vegan-friendly, gluten-free, and not an allergen
- Regulation: permitted in the EU as E463 and regulated in the U.S.

## Why is Hydroxypropyl cellulose added to food?
Food makers use hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) to control texture and stability. It helps water and oil mix more evenly (emulsification), keeps particles suspended (stabilisation), and adds body or thickness to sauces, fillings, and drinks. It can also create a thin, clear film on foods to reduce stickiness or moisture loss, and it resists separation during heating, cooling, and freeze–thaw cycles.

## What foods contain Hydroxypropyl cellulose?
You may find E463 in:
- Sauces, gravies, and salad dressings
- Fruit fillings, glazes, and icings for baked goods
- Dairy-style desserts and puddings, including plant-based versions
- Confectionery, gum, and chewy candies
- Ready-to-drink beverages and powdered drink mixes

Authorised uses and typical categories are listed in EU evaluations of cellulose derivatives used as food additives.[^1]

## What can replace Hydroxypropyl cellulose?
Depending on the recipe, formulators may swap HPC for:
- Other cellulose ethers: [methyl cellulose](/e461-methyl-cellulose){.additive}, [hydroxypropyl methylcellulose](/e464-hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose){.additive}, or [sodium carboxymethylcellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose){.additive}
- Gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, or [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- Base cellulose: [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive}

Each alternative behaves a bit differently. For example, xanthan builds viscosity at low levels and is very shear-stable; methyl cellulose gels when heated; carrageenan works well with proteins; and pectin sets in high-sugar, acidic systems.

## How is Hydroxypropyl cellulose made?
HPC is made by reacting purified plant cellulose with propylene oxide under alkaline conditions. This attaches hydroxypropyl groups to the cellulose chain, creating a water‑dispersible cellulose ether with the desired viscosity and film-forming properties.[^2]

## Is Hydroxypropyl cellulose safe to eat?
Based on EU scientific reviews of cellulose and its ethers (including E463), these additives are not absorbed intact in the gut, show no concern for genotoxicity or carcinogenicity, and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was considered “not specified,” meaning low toxicity at typical use levels.[^1] In the United States, hydroxypropyl cellulose is included in FDA’s Food Additive Status List and may be used in food in line with regulations and good manufacturing practice.[^3]

Some people may notice mild gastrointestinal effects (such as gas or softer stools) if they consume large amounts, as cellulose derivatives are poorly digested and can be fermented by gut bacteria.[^1]

## Does Hydroxypropyl cellulose have any benefits?
- Technical benefits: improves thickness, creaminess, suspension of particles, and freeze–thaw stability; helps prevent syneresis (weeping) in gels and fillings; and can reduce stickiness via a thin film.
- Formulation flexibility: works in water-based and some mixed systems, and helps stabilise reduced-fat or reduced-sugar recipes.
- Nutrition note: contributes negligible calories and is not digested like starch or sugar.

## Who should avoid Hydroxypropyl cellulose?
- Individuals with very sensitive digestion or those prone to gastrointestinal discomfort may wish to limit large intakes, as with many fiber-like additives.[^1]
- People under special medical diets should follow their healthcare provider’s advice.
- For most consumers, E463 is suitable, including vegetarian and vegan diets, as it is derived from plant cellulose.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E463 is plastic.”  
  Fact: It is a modified plant fiber (cellulose ether), not a plastic polymer used for packaging.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s the same as MSG.”  
  Fact: Hydroxypropyl cellulose is unrelated to glutamates like [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}; it is a cellulose derivative used mainly for texture.
- Myth: “It isn’t allowed in the U.S.”  
  Fact: FDA lists hydroxypropyl cellulose on its Food Additive Status List; it may be used under applicable regulations and good manufacturing practice.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s unsafe long-term.”  
  Fact: EU scientific panels re‑evaluated cellulose ethers (including E463) and found no safety concern at reported use levels, with an ADI not specified.[^1]

## Hydroxypropyl cellulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “hydroxypropyl cellulose,” “hydroxypropylcellulose,” or “E463.” It often appears in ingredient lists for salad dressings, fruit pie fillings, glazes, confectionery, chewing gum, dairy-style desserts, and beverage mixes. Levels are typically low and used to fine‑tune texture and stability.
