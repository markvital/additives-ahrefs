      "q": "what is e1420 in food",
      "a": "E1420 is acetylated starch, a plant-derived modified starch made by adding small acetyl groups to food starch; it functions as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier. This improves texture and stability, such as better freeze–thaw tolerance and reduced water separation in products like sauces and desserts.",

      "q": "what is the e number for acetylated oxidized starch",
      "a": "E1451 is the E‑number for acetylated oxidized starch (distinct from E1420, which is acetylated starch).",

    {
      "q": "why is starch acetylated",
      "a": "Starch is acetylated to improve processing and storage stability—maintaining consistent viscosity, resisting heat/acid/shear, and reducing retrogradation and syneresis. These changes provide smoother textures and better freeze–thaw stability, enhancing its use as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier.",
