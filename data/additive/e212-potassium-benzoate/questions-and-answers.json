      "q": "is potassium benzoate bad for you",
      "a": "At permitted food-use levels it's considered safe by regulators (JECFA ADI for benzoates: 0–5 mg/kg body weight/day, expressed as benzoic acid); a small number of people may be sensitive. In acidic drinks with vitamin C and heat/light, trace benzene can form, so manufacturers manage formulations and conditions.",
