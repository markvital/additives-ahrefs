Chlorine dioxide (E926) is a yellow-green gas used in food processing water as a powerful antimicrobial. It helps control bacteria on foods and equipment and is usually generated on-site and used at very low levels, leaving minimal residues in the final food when used correctly.

## At a glance
- What it is: Chlorine dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent and disinfectant assigned E-number E926.
- What it does: Reduces harmful microbes in processing water and on food surfaces; also used to sanitize process streams.
- Where it’s used: Common in wash water for fruits and vegetables and in approved systems for meat and poultry processing.
- How it’s made: Generated on-site from precursors like sodium chlorite because it’s too reactive to store.
- Labeling: Often treated as a “processing aid,” so it may not appear on the ingredient list of retail foods in the U.S.
- Dietary notes: Not made from animal sources; suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

## Why is Chlorine dioxide added to food?
Processors use chlorine dioxide to control bacteria, yeasts, and molds during washing and handling. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits its use in certain food-contact waters under specific conditions detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).[^1] The goal is to improve hygiene and reduce the risk of foodborne illness while keeping residues very low.

## What foods contain Chlorine dioxide?
You are most likely to encounter chlorine dioxide in the processing of fresh produce (for example, flumes and wash waters) and in approved antimicrobial systems for meat and poultry operations.[^1][^2] Because it functions as a processing aid and does not have a technical effect in the finished food, it is generally exempt from declaration on the ingredient label in the U.S.[^4]

## What can replace Chlorine dioxide?
Alternatives depend on the food, equipment, and local rules. Common options include:
- [Chlorine](/e925-chlorine) solutions
- Peracetic acid systems
- Ozone-based treatments
- Organic acid rinses
- Modified-atmosphere packaging using gases such as [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) and [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen) to slow spoilage

Approval and effective use levels differ by application and country.

## How is Chlorine dioxide made?
Chlorine dioxide is typically produced at the point of use by reacting sodium chlorite with an acid or with chlorine, yielding an aqueous solution. It is not shipped as a compressed gas because it is reactive and unstable, so on-site generation ensures both safety and effectiveness.[^3]

## Is Chlorine dioxide safe to eat?
When used as allowed by FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA FSIS), chlorine dioxide helps reduce microbes while keeping residues in food and processing water within strict limits.[^1][^2] For perspective on safety in water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets maximum residual disinfectant levels for chlorine dioxide and its by-product chlorite in public drinking water supplies.[^5] Consumers should not ingest products marketed to contain chlorine dioxide for “health” purposes; FDA warns these are dangerous and not approved.[^6]

## Does Chlorine dioxide have any benefits?
Its main benefit is food safety: it reduces microbial contamination on foods and in processing systems, helping to control pathogens that can cause illness.[^2] By lowering microbial load, it can also support better product quality during distribution.

## Who should avoid Chlorine dioxide?
- Do not ingest any product marketed as a drink or “supplement” containing chlorine dioxide; such products can cause serious harm and are not approved for medical use.[^6]
- People who are sensitive to disinfectants may prefer to rinse ready-to-eat produce under clean running water before eating. This is a general kitchen practice, not specific to chlorine dioxide.
- For home use, follow label directions on any produce-wash or surface sanitizing product and keep chemicals away from children.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Chlorine dioxide is the same as household bleach. Fact: While both are oxidizing disinfectants, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is a different chemical from sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) and behaves differently in water and on surfaces.[^3]
- Myth: It leaves high levels of chemicals on food. Fact: FDA rules limit how and where it can be used in food processing, with controls designed to keep residues very low.[^1]
- Myth: Drinking chlorine dioxide cures diseases. Fact: FDA warns that ingesting chlorine dioxide “miracle” products is dangerous and can cause serious health problems.[^6]

## Chlorine dioxide in branded foods
You will rarely see “chlorine dioxide” on retail ingredient lists because it is usually used as a processing aid with no function in the finished food and is therefore exempt from labeling in the U.S.[^4] Brands may mention it in technical quality documents or facility audits, but it is not commonly presented to shoppers as an ingredient.
