      "q": "does chlorophyll have magnesium",
      "a": "Yes—chlorophylls (E140i) contain a central magnesium ion. If Mg is lost during processing (forming pheophytin), the green color dulls.",

      "q": "\"what is the function of the magnesium atom in a chlorophyll molecule\"",
      "a": "The magnesium sits at the center of the chlorin ring, coordinating four nitrogens and tuning the electronic structure to absorb light. This enables efficient energy/electron transfer in photosynthesis and contributes to the green color.",

      "q": "1 gram contains 2.68 % magnesium. how many atoms of mg will there be in 1.00 g of chlorophyll?",
      "a": "At 2.68% Mg, 1.00 g contains 0.0268 g Mg ≈ 0.00110 mol (24.305 g/mol). That is about 6.6×10^20 magnesium atoms (0.00110 × 6.022×10^23).",

    {
      "q": "2. what is the function of the magnesium atom in a chlorophyll molecule?",
      "a": "The Mg ion is the central coordinating atom of the pigment’s ring, shaping the absorption spectrum so chlorophyll can harvest light and transfer energy.",

    {
      "q": "3. what is the function of the magnesium atom in a chlorophyll molecule?",
      "a": "It serves as the central metal that stabilizes the chlorin ring and enables light absorption; removing Mg alters the color and photochemistry (pheophytin formation).",

    {
      "q": "what does chlorophyll do",
      "a": "In foods, E140i (chlorophylls) are natural green pigments used as a color additive to give or restore a green hue; they don’t change the taste.",

    {
      "q": "is chlorophyll good for you",
      "a": "As a food colorant it’s considered safe at permitted levels, but it isn’t a nutrient and has no proven health benefits at typical intake.",

    {
      "q": "what is chlorophyll good for",
      "a": "It’s used to color foods green—such as beverages, sauces, and confectionery—and to help maintain a natural-looking green tone in plant-based products.",

    {
      "q": "what does chlorophyll do for the body",
      "a": "At the small amounts used as a color additive, it has no specific physiological benefits and is largely not absorbed.",

    {
      "q": "does chlorophyll make you poop",
      "a": "Not usually, though it can turn stools green; high supplemental intakes may cause mild gastrointestinal upset, including loose stools, in some people.",
