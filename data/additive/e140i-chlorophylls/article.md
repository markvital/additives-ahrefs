Chlorophylls (E140i) are green pigments extracted from edible plants and used to color foods. They give a natural-looking green shade and are most at home in fatty or oily foods like sauces, fillings, and confectionery coatings. This page covers what they do, where they show up, and how they’re regulated.

## At a glance
- Name on label: “Chlorophylls” or “E140i”
- What it does: Green food color
- Where it comes from: Edible leafy plants (for example, grass, alfalfa, spinach)
- Solubility: Best in fats and oils (for water-based foods, manufacturers often use related [chlorophyllins](/e140ii-chlorophyllins))
- Typical uses: Ice creams, dessert toppings, confectionery, sauces, and seasonings
- Dietary notes: Plant-derived; final products must meet purity specs set by law in the EU
- How to spot it: Look for “chlorophylls” or “E140i” in the ingredients list

## Why is Chlorophylls added to food?
Food makers add chlorophylls to create or restore a green color that signals freshness or a mint/herb flavor idea. E140i works well in fatty or oily foods because it is fat‑soluble, while related [chlorophyllins](/e140ii-chlorophyllins) disperse better in water-based products.[^1]  
When brighter, more light-stable greens are needed, you may also see the [copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins).

## What foods contain Chlorophylls?
You’re most likely to find E140i in:
- Confectionery and chewing gum (mint, herbal, or lime flavors)
- Ice cream, frozen desserts, and dessert sauces
- Cake decorations, frostings, and fillings
- Savory sauces, dressings, pesto-style spreads, and snacks
- Seasonings and herb mixes

Always check the ingredient list—manufacturers must list the color by name or E‑number in the EU.

## What can replace Chlorophylls?
Depending on the recipe and desired shade:
- [Chlorophyllins](/e140ii-chlorophyllins) for water-based foods
- [Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) for a brighter, more stable green
- Plant powders (spinach, parsley) for a muted, culinary green
- Other permitted colors where appropriate, such as [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) for yellow‑green tones or [carotene](/e160a-carotene) for warm hues

## How is Chlorophylls made?
In the EU, E140i is defined as the mixture of natural chlorophyll pigments obtained by extracting edible plant material. The process typically involves:
- Selecting edible leafy sources (such as alfalfa or spinach)
- Extracting the pigments with food‑grade solvents or vegetable oils
- Purifying and standardizing the color to meet legal purity specifications[^1]

Chlorophylls (E140i) are the fat‑soluble pigments. Related “chlorophyllins” (E140ii) are water‑dispersible derivatives made by converting the chlorophyll molecule into salt forms; they are listed separately and have their own specifications.[^1]

## Is Chlorophylls safe to eat?
In the European Union, chlorophylls are authorized food colors under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and must comply with strict identity and purity criteria set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2][^1] Food colours in the EU are assessed for safety by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before or during authorization and can be re‑evaluated over time as new data appear.[^3]  
When used as intended and within the applicable rules, chlorophylls are considered safe for the general population in the EU.[^2]

## Does Chlorophylls have any benefits?
Chlorophylls are added for appearance, not nutrition. The amounts used for coloring are small and are not a meaningful source of vitamins or minerals. Their benefit is cosmetic—making foods look green and appealing.

## Who should avoid Chlorophylls?
- People following “color-free” or elimination diets may wish to avoid all added colors, including E140i.
- Anyone who has experienced a sensitivity to green colorants should check labels and speak with a healthcare professional.
- If you have specific dietary restrictions, always review the ingredient list. In the EU, labels must show the additive name or E‑number so you can identify it.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Chlorophyll in foods detoxes the body.”  
  Fact: In foods, chlorophylls serve as colors. They are regulated for safety and labeling, not for health or medicinal effects.
- Myth: “All greens in food are artificial.”  
  Fact: Chlorophylls (E140i) are plant‑derived colors; other green shades may come from different permitted colorants.
- Myth: “If it’s natural, it never fades.”  
  Fact: Natural greens can be sensitive to light, heat, and acidity. That’s why makers sometimes use [chlorophyllins](/e140ii-chlorophyllins) or [copper complexes](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) for better stability.

## Chlorophylls in branded foods
You’ll see E140i most often in green candies, mint chewing gums, dessert toppings, herbal sauces, and snack seasonings. To check, read the ingredient list for “chlorophylls” or “E140i.”[^4] Products may switch between E140i, [E140ii](/e140ii-chlorophyllins), or [E141](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) to fine‑tune the shade and stability.
