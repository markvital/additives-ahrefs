      "q": "is ascorbic acid bad for you",
      "a": "No—ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is considered safe at typical food levels and is essential for health; it’s GRAS in the U.S. and approved in the EU. Very high supplemental doses can cause gastrointestinal upset and, in susceptible people, increase kidney stone risk.",

      "q": "how is ascorbic acid made",
      "a": "Industrially, D‑glucose is converted to 2‑keto‑L‑gulonic acid by fermentation (or via the older Reichstein process: glucose → sorbitol → L‑sorbose → 2‑KGA) and then chemically cyclized to ascorbic acid. Modern methods use two-step fermentation to improve efficiency.",
