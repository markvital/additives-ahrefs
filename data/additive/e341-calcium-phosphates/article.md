Calcium phosphates (E341) are a group of calcium salts of phosphoric acid used in foods mainly as leavening acids, anti-caking agents, and acidity regulators. They also serve as calcium sources for fortification and help stabilize powders and blends. In ingredient lists, you may see them as monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, or tricalcium phosphate.

## At a glance
- E-number: E341; a family that includes monocalcium (E341i), dicalcium (E341ii), and tricalcium phosphate (E341iii)
- What it does: leavening acid in baking, anti-caking in powders, buffer/acidity regulator, stabilizer, and calcium fortifier
- Where it’s found: baking powder, self-rising flour, cake mixes, powdered drinks, table salt, spices, creamers, and fortified foods
- Dietary notes: mineral-based; typically suitable for vegan and vegetarian diets
- Label names: “calcium phosphate,” “monocalcium/dicalcium/tricalcium phosphate,” or simply “E341”

## Why is Calcium phosphates added to food?
Calcium phosphates are added because they perform several behind-the-scenes jobs that keep foods consistent and easy to use. Monocalcium phosphate (E341i) is a fast-acting leavening acid that reacts with baking soda to release carbon dioxide and raise baked goods. Tricalcium phosphate (E341iii) helps powders like salt and spices flow freely by preventing clumping, and the group as a whole helps buffer acidity and stabilize dry blends.[^1][^2] In the U.S., several calcium phosphate forms are affirmed or listed by FDA for specific technical functions when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## What foods contain Calcium phosphates?
You will most often find calcium phosphates in:
- Baking staples: baking powder, self-rising flour, pancake and cake mixes
- Dry powders: table salt, spice blends, powdered drink mixes, cocoa, and dairy creamers
- Fortified foods: breakfast cereals, plant-based drinks, and nutrition bars (as calcium sources)
- Confectionery and snacks: certain candies, coatings, and crisp snacks

On labels, the specific form may be named, for example [monocalcium phosphate](/e341i-monocalcium-phosphate), [dicalcium phosphate](/e341ii-dicalcium-phosphate), or [tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate).

## What can replace Calcium phosphates?
The best substitute depends on the job it is doing.
- Leavening acid in baking: options include [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate) or other [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates), and they are typically paired with baking soda ([sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate)).
- Anti-caking in powders: common alternatives are [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) and [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate).
- Buffering/acidity control: formulators may use [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or organic acids such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), depending on the recipe.
- Calcium fortification: other calcium salts like [calcium carbonates](/e170-calcium-carbonates) are often used.

## How is Calcium phosphates made?
Food-grade calcium phosphates are produced by carefully reacting food-grade phosphoric acid with calcium sources such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide, followed by filtration, drying, and milling. Varying the ratio of calcium to phosphate and the processing conditions yields monocalcium, dicalcium, or tricalcium phosphate. The EU specifications define identity, purity, and limits for contaminants for E341 additives.[^2]

## Is Calcium phosphates safe to eat?
Regulators assess calcium phosphates as part of the wider phosphate group. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day, covering E341 among others.[^1] In the U.S., several calcium phosphate forms are recognized by FDA for specified uses when used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, which includes using the minimum amount needed for the effect.[^3] As with many additives, actual exposure depends on your diet; typical use levels in foods are low relative to the ADI.[^1]

## Does Calcium phosphates have any benefits?
- Technological: Helps dough rise, keeps powders free-flowing, stabilizes blends, and buffers acidity.
- Nutritional: When used to fortify, it can contribute calcium to the diet, which supports bone and teeth health. The actual benefit depends on the product and serving size.

## Who should avoid Calcium phosphates?
Most people don’t need to avoid calcium phosphates in ordinary amounts. However:
- Individuals with chronic kidney disease or on phosphate-restricted diets are often advised to limit phosphorus intake from additives, including phosphate salts.[^4]
- EFSA noted that high use of phosphate additives across many processed foods can push intake above the ADI for some young children, so a diet high in such products may warrant attention from caregivers.[^1]

If you have a kidney condition or a medically prescribed low-phosphate diet, follow your healthcare provider’s guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as phosphoric acid in sodas.” Fact: Calcium phosphates are salts, not acids; they behave differently in food.
- Myth: “It’s only there to add calcium.” Fact: It can add calcium, but it’s most often used for leavening, anti-caking, or buffering.
- Myth: “It’s an animal-derived additive.” Fact: Food-grade calcium phosphates are mineral-based and typically suitable for vegan diets.
- Myth: “It makes food taste chalky.” Fact: At the low levels used, its role is functional; it usually does not affect taste when properly formulated.

## Calcium phosphates in branded foods
You can spot E341 on ingredient lists of baking powder, self-rising flour, pancake mixes, powdered drink mixes, flavored salts, and some fortified cereals. Formulas change over time, so always check the current label. If you are tracking phosphorus intake, compare similar products—some use phosphate additives while others rely on alternatives.
