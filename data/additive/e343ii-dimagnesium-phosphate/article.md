Dimagnesium phosphate (E343II) is a mineral salt made from magnesium and phosphate. In foods, it is mainly used as a stabiliser and thickener, and sometimes to help control acidity. It is approved in the EU and appears on labels as E343, E343ii, or dimagnesium phosphate.

## At a glance
- Dimagnesium phosphate is the dibasic magnesium salt of phosphoric acid; also called magnesium hydrogen phosphate and dimagnesium orthophosphate.
- It functions mostly as a stabiliser and thickener, and can help buffer acidity in certain recipes.
- You may find it in powdered mixes, dairy alternatives, baked goods, confectionery, and some dietary supplements.
- It is vegan and allergen-free by composition.
- Regulators in the EU group it with other phosphates and set limits to keep intake within safe ranges.

## Why is Dimagnesium phosphate added to food?
Food makers use dimagnesium phosphate to stabilise texture, thicken liquids and gels, and keep acidity within a steady range. In EU law, it is listed as a permitted food additive with these functions, alongside other phosphate salts.[^3]

## What foods contain Dimagnesium phosphate?
Dimagnesium phosphate shows up in places where a firm, even texture or buffering is needed. Examples include:
- Powdered drink and dessert mixes
- Dairy alternatives and processed dairy-style products
- Confectionery and chewing gum
- Baked goods and baking mixes
- Certain dietary supplements (as a mineral salt)

Approved uses and maximum levels vary by food category under EU rules.[^3]

## What can replace Dimagnesium phosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job it does in the recipe:
- For acidity control and buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or other [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) and [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates)
- For thickening or stabilising: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- For general phosphate functionality: [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) or [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates)

The best substitute depends on pH, saltiness, heat treatment, and the desired mouthfeel.

## How is Dimagnesium phosphate made?
Food‑grade dimagnesium phosphate is produced by neutralising food‑grade phosphoric acid with a magnesium source (such as magnesium oxide or hydroxide), then filtering and drying the salt. Its identity and purity must meet EU specifications for E‑numbers, including defined assay ranges and impurity limits for contaminants like heavy metals and fluoride.[^2]

## Is Dimagnesium phosphate safe to eat?
In 2019, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated phosphates used as food additives (including E343) and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day from all phosphate additives. Typical intakes from permitted uses are considered safe when overall phosphorus consumption stays within this limit.[^1] Food‑grade dimagnesium phosphate must also meet strict composition and purity specifications in EU law.[^2]

## Does Dimagnesium phosphate have any benefits?
Its main benefits are technological: it helps keep foods stable and consistent. As a magnesium salt, it can contribute small amounts of magnesium, an essential mineral that supports muscle and nerve function, among other roles. However, additives are not a reliable way to meet magnesium needs; a balanced diet remains the best source.[^5]

## Who should avoid Dimagnesium phosphate?
- People with kidney disease or those told to limit phosphorus should be careful with phosphate additives, including E343II, because their bodies may have trouble clearing excess phosphorus.[^6] EFSA has also noted that sensitive groups with impaired kidney function could be at higher risk from high phosphate intakes.[^1]
- Individuals on magnesium‑restricted diets or taking medications that interact with magnesium salts (for example, some tetracycline antibiotics) should seek medical advice. Magnesium can interfere with absorption of certain drugs if taken at the same time.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Dimagnesium phosphate is a preservative. Fact: It is mainly a stabiliser, thickener, and acidity regulator.
- Myth: All phosphates act the same. Fact: Different phosphate salts have different solubilities, pH effects, and uses in food.
- Myth: E‑numbers are always artificial. Fact: E‑numbers are simply approvals; dimagnesium phosphate is a mineral salt.
- Myth: It contains aluminium. Fact: Dimagnesium phosphate is a magnesium salt and does not contain aluminium.

## Dimagnesium phosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “dimagnesium phosphate,” “magnesium hydrogen phosphate,” or the codes “E343,” “E343ii,” or “E343 (ii).” Placement on the list reflects how much is used. If you are managing phosphorus or magnesium intake, compare products and serving sizes and consult a healthcare professional if unsure.
