Sodium salts of fatty acids (E470AI) are food-grade “soaps” made from edible fats and oils. In tiny amounts, they help mix ingredients that don’t naturally blend and keep powders from clumping. You’ll mostly see them in dry mixes, baked goods, and confectionery.

## At a glance

- What it is: Food-grade sodium salts of common fatty acids (such as stearic or palmitic acid) made from edible fats and oils.
- What it does: Works as an emulsifier, stabiliser, and flow aid to keep mixtures smooth and free‑flowing.
- Where it’s used: Dry mixes, baking powders, confectionery, seasonings, beverages, and more.
- Status: Authorized for use in both the U.S. and EU under good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^1][^3]

## Why is Sodium salts of fatty acids added to food?

Food makers use E470AI to help oil and water mix (emulsifying), steady that mixture over time (stabilising), and improve flow in dry blends so they don’t cake or clump. It can also act as a processing aid, for example helping powders release from equipment or molds. These uses are allowed at levels needed to achieve the intended effect under GMP in the U.S. and EU.[^1][^3]

## What foods contain Sodium salts of fatty acids?

You’re most likely to find E470AI in:

- Baking mixes, dessert powders, and instant drink powders
- Seasoning blends, cocoa, and powdered creamers
- Confectionery and chewing gum bases[^4]
- Some baked goods and snack coatings

On labels, it may appear as “sodium stearate,” “sodium palmitate,” or “sodium salts of fatty acids.”

## What can replace Sodium salts of fatty acids?

Options depend on the job it’s doing:

- Emulsifying/stabilising: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}, or certain [citric acid esters](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}
- Dough/batter strengthening or whipping: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}
- Powder flow and anti-caking: [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive} or [sodium carboxy‑methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose){.additive} in some formulas

If you need a broader family alternative, see [E470a (sodium, potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids)](/e470a-sodium-potassium-and-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or the mixed‑salt group [E470 (sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids)](/e470-sodium-potassium-calcium-and-magnesium-salts-of-fatty-acids){.additive}.

## How is Sodium salts of fatty acids made?

E470AI is produced by reacting edible fatty acids—obtained from food‑grade fats and oils—with a sodium base (such as sodium hydroxide), forming sodium salts of those fatty acids.[^2] The result is a white, fine powder that disperses in water and performs well in dry systems. EU specifications require it to be made from edible sources and meet defined purity criteria.[^2]

## Is Sodium salts of fatty acids safe to eat?

Yes. In the United States, “salts of fatty acids” are permitted for direct addition to food under GMP conditions in 21 CFR 172.863.[^1] In the European Union, E470a (which includes the sodium variants) appears on the Union list of authorized food additives, with detailed identity and purity set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^3][^2] Internationally, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assigned an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) “not specified,” indicating low concern at typical use levels.[^5]

## Does Sodium salts of fatty acids have any benefits?

- Consistent texture: Keeps powders free‑flowing and helps mixes blend evenly.
- Processing reliability: Aids release from equipment and reduces sticking.
- Stable emulsions: Helps oil-and-water mixtures hold together during shelf life.

These benefits are technological, not nutritional.

## Who should avoid Sodium salts of fatty acids?

- People closely tracking sodium intake: E470AI contributes very little sodium compared with major dietary sources, but those on strict sodium‑restricted diets may still prefer to minimize additives that contain sodium.
- Dietary preference concerns: The fatty acids come from edible fats and oils; if the source matters to you (e.g., plant‑only diets), check with the manufacturer about sourcing.[^2]

There are no common allergen concerns associated with E470AI at permitted use levels.

## Myths & facts

- “It’s soap—so it doesn’t belong in food.” Fact: Food‑grade sodium fatty acid salts are highly purified and used in tiny amounts for specific functions, and regulators in the U.S. and EU allow their use under GMP.[^1][^3]
- “It adds harmful trans fat.” Fact: E470AI is a salt of fatty acids, not a hydrogenated fat. It does not introduce trans fat.
- “It’s just a filler.” Fact: Its main roles are functional—emulsifying, stabilising, and improving flow—rather than bulking.

## Sodium salts of fatty acids in branded foods

You’ll often see E470AI in ingredient lists for:

- Chewing gum and soft candy (as part of gum base or to aid texture)[^4]
- Instant cocoa, drink mixes, and flavored powders
- Baking mixes and powdered dessert bases
- Seasoning blends and dry coatings

Look for names like “sodium stearate,” “sodium palmitate,” or “sodium salts of fatty acids.”
