      "q": "explain why sodium salts of fatty acids, although they are salts, are not very soluble in water",
      "a": "Their long hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails outweigh the small ionic (carboxylate) head, so they prefer to aggregate into micelles or lamellar phases rather than disperse as individual ions; solubility decreases with chain length and is generally lower for sodium than potassium salts.",

    {
      "q": "what are sodium or potassium salts of fatty acids",
      "a": "They are soaps—anionic surfactants (RCOO− Na+ or RCOO− K+) formed by neutralizing fatty acids with sodium or potassium hydroxide, used in foods as emulsifiers and stabilizers.",

      "q": "what are sodium salts of long chain fatty acids called",
      "a": "They are commonly called soaps, for example sodium stearate or sodium palmitate.",

    {
      "q": "what do the sodium salts of fatty acids taste like",
      "a": "They have a characteristic soapy, slightly bitter/alkaline taste; at typical food-use levels they contribute little flavor but can cause a soapy off-note if overused.",

    {
      "q": "what is special about sodium salts of fatty acids",
      "a": "They are amphiphilic surfactants that lower surface tension and self-assemble (e.g., into micelles), enabling them to emulsify and stabilize fat–water mixtures. They can also form insoluble “soaps” with calcium or magnesium ions.",
