Lecithin (E322i) is a natural emulsifier and antioxidant found in egg yolk and many plant oils like soy and sunflower. In foods, it helps oils and water mix, giving smoother texture, better mouthfeel, and more stable products. You’ll spot it in chocolate, baked goods, spreads, and instant powders.

## At a glance
- What it is: A mixture of phospholipids used mainly as an emulsifier and antioxidant.
- Where it comes from: Commonly from soybeans and sunflower; also found in egg yolk.
- What it does: Helps oil and water blend, reduces splattering, improves texture, and keeps products from separating.
- Typical foods: Chocolate, margarine and spreads, bakery items, instant drink mixes, peanut butter, and cooking sprays.
- Diet notes: Often labeled “soy lecithin” or “sunflower lecithin.” People with soy or egg allergies should check labels.
- Safety: Approved in the U.S. and EU for many uses; considered safe at permitted levels.

## Why is Lecithin added to food?
Lecithin keeps oil and water from separating, which makes foods look and feel better. In chocolate it lowers viscosity for smoother flow and snap; in bakery dough it improves mixing and reduces sticking; in spreads and sauces it stabilizes emulsions and reduces spatter during cooking. It can also protect flavors and fats by acting as a mild antioxidant.

## What foods contain Lecithin?
You can find lecithin across many categories:
- Confectionery: chocolate bars, coatings, fillings
- Bakery: breads, cakes, cookies, wafers
- Spreads and fats: margarine, nut butters, spray oils
- Beverages: instant cocoa or coffee mixes
- Dairy and dairy-alternatives: ice cream, creamers
- Savory foods: dressings, sauces, reconstituted soups

On labels it may appear as “lecithin,” “soy lecithin,” “sunflower lecithin,” or “E322.” In the EU, E322 may be subdivided; E322i denotes lecithin and E322ii denotes hydrolysed lecithin.

## What can replace Lecithin?
Depending on the job (emulsifying, thickening, or improving dough), food makers may use:
- Emulsifiers: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate){.additive}, [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}
- Gums and stabilizers: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}
- Others depending on product style and regulations

## How is Lecithin made?
Commercial lecithin is typically produced during the “degumming” step of refining edible vegetable oils. Hydrating the crude oil causes phospholipids to separate; these are then filtered, dried, and standardized to produce fluid or powdered lecithin.[^1] In the EU, lecithins (E322) are defined as mixtures of phosphatides; E322i refers to lecithin, while E322ii refers to hydrolysed forms, with specifications set by law.[^3]

## Is Lecithin safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, lecithin is an approved direct food substance and is considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the scientific authority (EFSA) re-evaluated lecithins (E 322) and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels as a food additive.[^2]

## Does Lecithin have any benefits?
For foods, lecithin improves texture, consistency, and stability, and it can make processing more efficient (for example, by improving flow in chocolate or reducing sticking in bakery lines). Nutritionally, lecithin provides phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, a source of choline, though the amounts in typical food uses are small compared to overall dietary needs.[^5]

## Who should avoid Lecithin?
- People with soy or egg allergies should check labels. In the U.S., if a food contains soy-derived lecithin, “soy” must be declared in the ingredient list or “Contains” statement.[^4] In the EU, allergens must be indicated on the label, including the source of lecithin when it comes from soy or egg.[^3]
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to avoid specific allergens or ingredients, follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- “All lecithin comes from soy.” False. It also comes from sunflower, rapeseed, and egg.
- “Lecithin always makes products taste beany.” False. Food-grade lecithin is highly refined and used at very low levels, so flavor impact is usually minimal.
- “Non-GMO and sunflower lecithin are the same thing.” Not necessarily. Sunflower lecithin can be non-GMO, but non-GMO soy lecithin also exists.

## Lecithin in branded foods
You’ll often see lecithin on ingredient lists of chocolate bars, chocolate chips, peanut butter, margarine, cookies, and instant cocoa mixes. It may appear as “soy lecithin,” “sunflower lecithin,” “lecithin (E322),” or simply “E322.” If you want to avoid soy, look for products that specify “sunflower lecithin” or clearly list an alternative emulsifier such as [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or [sucrose esters](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids){.additive}.
