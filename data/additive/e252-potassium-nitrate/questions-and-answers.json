      "q": "how to make potassium nitrate",
      "a": "Industrial and food-grade potassium nitrate is made by neutralizing nitric acid with a potassium base (e.g., potassium hydroxide or carbonate) and then purifying/crystallizing; it should not be made at home, and food use requires regulated, food-grade material.",
