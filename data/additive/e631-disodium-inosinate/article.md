Disodium inosinate (E631) is a flavor enhancer that brings out a deep, savory “umami” taste. It is potent at very low levels and is often paired with other enhancers to make foods taste richer.

## At a glance
- What it is: the disodium salt of 5′-inosinic acid, used as a flavor enhancer that boosts umami.
- E-number: E631; may appear on labels as “disodium inosinate” or “E631.”
- Where it’s used: savory snacks, instant noodles, soups, sauces, spice mixes, and cured meats.
- Common partners: often used with [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} (MSG) and sometimes with [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive} or blends like [disodium 5-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide){.additive}.
- Typical source: frequently made by microbial fermentation of plant sugars; sourcing can vary by manufacturer.
- Regulation: permitted for use under U.S. and EU food additive rules and subject to purity specifications.

## Why is Disodium inosinate added to food?
Disodium inosinate is added to lift savory, meaty notes—the umami taste. It is especially effective when combined with glutamates such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}, and may also be paired with [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive}; together they create a stronger flavor impact than any one alone, so only tiny amounts are needed.[^1]

## What foods contain Disodium inosinate?
You’ll most often see E631 in:
- Potato chips and other savory snacks
- Instant noodles and seasoning packets
- Canned and instant soups
- Sauces, gravies, bouillon, and spice mixes
- Processed meats (e.g., sausages, deli meats)

It’s used where a pronounced savory profile is desired, sometimes alongside salt, spices, and other enhancers.

## What can replace Disodium inosinate?
- Other flavor enhancers: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}, [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive}, or blends like [disodium 5-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide){.additive}.
- Ingredient-based options: yeast extract, tomato paste, mushroom powder, seaweed, aged cheese, or slow-cooked stocks—all naturally rich in umami.
- Product reformulation: adjusting salt, acids, and spices to rebalance overall flavor.

## How is Disodium inosinate made?
Commercially, E631 is typically produced by fermentation: food-grade microbes convert plant-derived sugars into 5′-inosinic acid (IMP). The IMP is then neutralized and crystallized as the disodium salt. Some processes can also obtain the nucleotide from animal or other biological sources, depending on the manufacturer and region.[^1]

## Is Disodium inosinate safe to eat?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists disodium inosinate as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) when used according to good manufacturing practice.[^2] In the European Union, it is an authorized food additive under the general food additive regulation, and its use is controlled by category-specific rules.[^3] In addition, E631 must meet EU purity specifications that define identity and limits for impurities.[^4]

## Does Disodium inosinate have any benefits?
- Culinary: It delivers a strong umami lift at very low use levels, helping foods taste richer and more “savory.”
- Practical: Because it is potent, small amounts can fine-tune flavor without large changes to other ingredients.
- It does not provide vitamins or minerals; its role is flavor, not nutrition.

## Who should avoid Disodium inosinate?
- Infants and young children: In the EU, ribonucleotide flavor enhancers like E631 are not authorized in most foods for infants and young children unless specifically allowed by law.[^3]
- People with specific dietary rules (vegan/vegetarian, religious, or allergen concerns): While many modern supplies are made by fermentation of plant sugars, sourcing can vary. If this matters to you, check with the manufacturer.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E631 is just another name for MSG.”  
  Fact: It is a different compound. It’s often used with [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} because they amplify each other’s umami effect.

- Myth: “E631 is always from pork or fish.”  
  Fact: Many manufacturers produce E631 by microbial fermentation of plant sugars today. Sourcing can vary—ask the brand if you need to know.

- Myth: “E631 is banned.”  
  Fact: It is permitted in both the U.S. (GRAS) and the EU under additive regulations.[^2][^3]

- Myth: “E631 has a strong taste by itself.”  
  Fact: On its own it’s mild. Its main job is to boost other savory flavors at tiny amounts.

## Disodium inosinate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “disodium inosinate” or “E631.” You’ll often see it listed next to [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} or [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive} in snack chips, instant noodle seasonings, canned soups, bouillon cubes, gravies, and some processed meats. The exact formulation differs by brand and product style.
