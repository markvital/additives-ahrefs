      "q": "is disodium inosinate bad for you",

      "q": "what does disodium inosinate do to your body",
      "a": "It mainly enhances umami taste by acting on taste receptors; once consumed, it’s broken down to nucleosides and uric acid and, at normal food levels, has no meaningful physiological effect for most people.",
