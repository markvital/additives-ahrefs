Anthocyanins (E163) are natural pigments that make many fruits and vegetables look red, purple, or blue. As a food additive, they are used mainly to give or boost color, especially in drinks, sweets, and dairy-style products. They are extracted from edible plants such as grape skins, berries, purple corn, and red cabbage.

## At a glance
- What it is: Plant pigments that act as a natural food color.
- What it does: Adds red-to-purple color; shade shifts with acidity.
- Common sources: Grape skins, elderberry, black carrot, purple corn, red cabbage.
- Typical foods: Beverages, jams, ice cream and yogurt, confectionery, and bakery items.
- Regulatory status: Approved in the European Union as E163; several anthocyanin-rich color sources are permitted in the United States under color-additive rules.

## Why is Anthocyanins added to food?
Food makers add anthocyanins to create or restore red, purple, and blue shades that consumers expect in fruit-flavored products. The exact hue depends on pH (acidity): more acidic foods tend to look brighter red, while less acidic systems can shift toward purple or blue.[^1]

Anthocyanins are valued because they come from edible plants and can be labeled as a natural color in many markets. However, they are sensitive to heat, light, and storage time, so recipes and packaging are chosen to protect their color.[^1]

## What foods contain Anthocyanins?
In the EU, anthocyanins (E163) are authorized as a color additive across many categories under the general food additive regulation, with detailed specifications and conditions of use laid out in EU law.[^2] You will most often find them in soft drinks, flavored waters, jams and preserves, confectionery, ice cream and fermented milk products, and some baked goods.

In the U.S., anthocyanin colors appear on labels through specific approved sources that are “exempt from certification,” such as fruit juice for color or grape skin extract (also called enocianina). Labels may read “fruit juice (for color)” or name the source, such as “grape skin extract.”[^3]

## What can replace Anthocyanins?
Depending on the target shade and pH, formulators may switch to other approved colors:
- For bright yellow to orange: [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive} or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}
- For red: [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive}
- For brown tones or cola shades: [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive}
- For green: [copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e141-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins){.additive}

Choice depends on flavor impact, stability, label goals, and cost.

## How is Anthocyanins made?
Commercial anthocyanin colors are produced by extracting pigments from edible plant materials (for example, grape skins, elderberries, black carrots, purple corn, or red cabbage). Food-grade solvents like water and ethanol are used, followed by filtration and concentration. The EU sets composition and purity specifications for E163, including permitted extraction methods and source materials.[^4] In the U.S., grape skin extract (enocianina) is one example of an approved anthocyanin color; it is prepared by extracting grape skins with aqueous alcohol and concentrating the extract.[^5]

## Is Anthocyanins safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated anthocyanins (E163) and did not identify safety concerns at currently permitted uses and exposure levels.[^1] In the EU, E163 is authorized under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and must meet the specifications in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

In the U.S., certain anthocyanin-rich color sources (for example, fruit juice for color and grape skin extract) are permitted as color additives “exempt from certification” and must meet identity and purity requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).[^3]

## Does Anthocyanins have any benefits?
Anthocyanins give foods an appealing, fruit-like color that signals flavor and freshness to consumers. While these pigments occur naturally in many fruits and vegetables, when used as an additive the purpose is coloring, not nutrition or health effects.

## Who should avoid Anthocyanins?
- People with known allergies to the source material (such as grape, berry, or cabbage extracts) should check labels and consult a healthcare professional if unsure.
- If you are following specific medical advice to limit added colors, review ingredient lists for E163 or named sources like “fruit juice (for color).”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Anthocyanins are synthetic dyes. Fact: They are plant pigments extracted from edible sources.[^4]
- Myth: They always look blue. Fact: The color shifts with pH, ranging from red in acidic foods to purple or blue at higher pH.[^1]
- Myth: All anthocyanin labels look the same. Fact: In the U.S., you’ll often see the source named (for example, “fruit juice (for color)” or “grape skin extract”), not the word “anthocyanins.”[^3]

## Anthocyanins in branded foods
You’ll commonly see E163 used in:
- Fruit drinks, flavored waters, and sports or energy beverages
- Jams, fruit preps, and dessert toppings
- Yogurts, dairy-style and plant-based desserts
- Gummies, hard candies, and icing
- Breakfast pastries and cakes where a berry color is desired

On labels, look for “E163,” “anthocyanins,” “fruit/vegetable juice (for color),” or named sources like “black carrot concentrate” or “grape skin extract.”
