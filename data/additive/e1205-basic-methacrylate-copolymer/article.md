Basic methacrylate copolymer (E1205) is a food-grade plastic film-former used mainly to coat solid products. It helps make tablets smoother, mask bitter tastes, and protect sensitive ingredients during storage. In the European Union, it is an approved additive with strict identity and purity rules.

## At a glance
- What it is: a synthetic copolymer used as a clear, thin coating (glazing agent) on solid foods and supplements.
- What it does: masks taste and odor, improves swallowability, reduces dusting, and helps keep moisture away.
- Where you’ll see it: the labels of some coated vitamin and mineral tablets, caplets, and similar solid supplements.
- Label names: “E1205” or “Basic methacrylate copolymer.”
- Related additives: [neutral methacrylate copolymer](/e1206-neutral-methacrylate-copolymer){.additive} and [anionic methacrylate copolymer](/e1207-anionic-methacrylate-copolymer){.additive}.

## Why is Basic methacrylate copolymer added to food?
Manufacturers use E1205 to form a smooth, protective film on tablets and other solid pieces. This thin coating can:
- mask bitter or metallic notes so the product tastes milder,
- make tablets easier to swallow,
- cut down on dust and chipping during processing and transport,
- help shield sensitive ingredients from moisture and air.

## What foods contain Basic methacrylate copolymer?
You’ll most often find E1205 in coated food supplements sold as tablets, caplets, or dragees. Its use in the EU appears on the Union list of approved additives; always check the latest Annex II entries for the exact food categories and any conditions of use.[^3]

## What can replace Basic methacrylate copolymer?
Depending on the job (shine, protection, taste masking), formulators may choose:
- [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}
- [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive}
- [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan){.additive}
- [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol){.additive}
- [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive}
- Other methacrylate types, such as [neutral methacrylate copolymer](/e1206-neutral-methacrylate-copolymer){.additive} or [anionic methacrylate copolymer](/e1207-anionic-methacrylate-copolymer){.additive}

The best substitute depends on whether the goal is gloss, moisture protection, faster or slower dissolving, or stronger taste masking.

## How is Basic methacrylate copolymer made?
E1205 is produced by polymerizing several methacrylate-based building blocks (monomers) into a large, food-grade copolymer. In EU specifications, it is defined as a copolymer of specific methacrylate esters that contains basic (amine-bearing) groups, which give it its “basic” character and film-forming behavior.[^1] After polymerization, the material is purified to meet strict limits for residual monomers and solvents, then supplied as a powder or dispersion for coating use.[^1]

## Is Basic methacrylate copolymer safe to eat?
In the European Union, food additives can be used only if they are authorized in the Union list and meet criteria laid down in law, which include a prior safety assessment and technological need.[^2] For E1205, there are detailed EU specifications covering identity and purity, including limits on residual monomers and manufacturing impurities, and products must comply with these to be placed on the market.[^1]

As with all additives, actual permitted foods and maximum levels (if any) are set in the Union list. Manufacturers must follow those conditions of use.[^2]

## Does Basic methacrylate copolymer have any benefits?
E1205 does not supply nutrition, but it can improve the product experience:
- smoother tablets that are easier to swallow,
- better-tasting tablets because bitterness is masked,
- coatings that help keep active ingredients stable until consumption.

## Who should avoid Basic methacrylate copolymer?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic additives may choose products without polymer coatings.
- If a healthcare professional has advised you to avoid certain coatings or excipients, check labels for “E1205” or “basic methacrylate copolymer.”
- For young children or anyone with difficulty swallowing, choose formats recommended by a clinician; coatings do not change choking risks for large tablets.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as plastic packaging.” Fact: E1205 is a food additive used as a very thin, edible coating on the product itself, not a packaging material.
- Myth: “It adds calories.” Fact: This polymer is used at very low levels for technological effects and does not contribute meaningful calories.
- Myth: “All methacrylate coatings are the same.” Fact: Basic, neutral, and anionic types behave differently; formulators choose among them for how and where the coating should dissolve.

## Basic methacrylate copolymer in branded foods
On labels, look for “E1205” or “basic methacrylate copolymer.” You’re most likely to see it on coated vitamin or mineral tablets, some herbal caplets, and other solid supplements. Availability varies by country because rules and common formulations differ.
