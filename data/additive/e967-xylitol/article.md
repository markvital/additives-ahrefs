Xylitol (E967) is a sugar alcohol used to sweeten foods with fewer calories than table sugar and without adding a strong aftertaste. It also helps keep products moist and stable, which is why it shows up in sugar‑free gum, mints, and some baked goods. It is not safe for dogs, so keep xylitol‑containing products out of their reach.

## At a glance
- What it is: A sugar alcohol (polyol) sweetener that also works as a humectant and stabilizer
- Taste and calories: Similar sweetness to sugar with about 2.4 kcal per gram
- Where you’ll find it: Sugar‑free gum and mints, candies, some baked goods, and oral‑care items
- Notable caution: Can cause stomach upset in large amounts; extremely toxic to dogs
- Also known as: E967

## Why is Xylitol added to food?
Food makers use xylitol to add sweetness while providing fewer calories than sugar and to help products hold moisture and maintain texture over shelf life. In the United States, xylitol is an approved direct food additive and may be used as a sweetener, humectant, stabilizer, or thickener in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] Sugar alcohols, including xylitol, are assigned 2.4 kcal per gram for nutrition labeling, lower than sucrose’s 4 kcal per gram.[^2]

## What foods contain Xylitol?
You are most likely to find xylitol in:
- Sugar‑free chewing gum and mints
- Sugar‑free candies and lozenges
- Some “no added sugar” or “reduced sugar” baked goods and dessert toppings
- Certain dairy desserts and nutrition bars
- Toothpaste and mouthwash (not foods, but common consumer products containing xylitol)

Always check ingredient lists for “xylitol” or “E967.” Some labels also group it under “sugar alcohols.”

## What can replace Xylitol?
Depending on the job xylitol is doing, possible substitutes include:
- Sweeteners with similar bulk: [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive}, [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive}, [mannitol](/e421-mannitol){.additive}, [isomalt](/e953-isomalt){.additive}, [maltitol](/e965-maltitol){.additive}
- High‑intensity sweeteners (no bulk, very sweet): [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive}, [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive}, [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k){.additive}, [aspartame](/e951-aspartame){.additive}
- Humectants for moisture: [glycerol](/e422-glycerol){.additive}
- Texture aids/thickeners: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}

Formulators often blend sweeteners to match sugar’s sweetness profile, bulk, and mouthfeel.

## How is Xylitol made?
Commercial xylitol is typically produced by:
1) Obtaining xylose from plant materials rich in hemicellulose (such as hardwoods like birch or agricultural residues like corn cobs).
2) Purifying the xylose.
3) Catalytically hydrogenating xylose under pressure (commonly over a nickel catalyst) to convert it into xylitol.
4) Purifying and crystallizing the xylitol for use in foods.[^5]

## Is Xylitol safe to eat?
Yes, for the general population when used as intended. In the U.S., xylitol is permitted as a direct food additive under specific conditions of use.[^1] Like other polyols, it can cause gas, bloating, or a laxative effect if you consume a lot at once. In the EU, foods containing more than 10% added polyols must carry the statement “excessive consumption may produce laxative effects.”[^6] From a nutrition standpoint, sugar alcohols are counted at 2.4 kcal per gram on U.S. labels, reflecting their partial absorption.[^2]

## Does Xylitol have any benefits?
- Dental health: The FDA authorizes a health claim that foods sweetened with sugar alcohols like xylitol do not promote dental caries (tooth decay), when they meet the criteria in the regulation.[^3]
- Fewer calories than sugar: At 2.4 kcal per gram, xylitol can reduce the calorie content of sweet foods compared with sucrose.[^2]
- Functionality: Xylitol helps retain moisture and can add body, which is useful in sugar‑free confections and baked goods.

## Who should avoid Xylitol?
- Dogs and other pets: Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing rapid insulin release, hypoglycemia, and potentially liver failure. Keep all xylitol‑containing products away from pets.[^4]
- People with sensitive digestion: Large amounts of polyols can cause gastrointestinal discomfort. EU labels warn about a potential laxative effect when polyols exceed 10% of the product.[^6]
- Individuals following clinician‑directed diets: If you have a medical reason to limit polyols, consult your healthcare provider about appropriate intake.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Xylitol is purely artificial.” Fact: Xylitol occurs naturally in small amounts in fruits and vegetables and is also formed in human metabolism; commercial production uses hydrogenation of plant‑derived xylose.[^5]
- Myth: “Sugar‑free means calorie‑free.” Fact: Xylitol has calories (about 2.4 kcal/g), though fewer than sugar.
- Myth: “If it’s safe for people, it’s safe for pets.” Fact: Xylitol is dangerous for dogs even in small amounts; treat it like a household toxin around pets.[^4]
- Myth: “All products with xylitol must carry a laxative warning.” Fact: In the EU, the warning applies when a food contains more than 10% added polyols; requirements differ by region.[^6]

## Xylitol in branded foods
You’ll commonly see xylitol in sugar‑free gums, mints, and lozenges, plus some “no added sugar” candies, baked goods, and nutrition bars. To spot it, look for “xylitol,” “E967,” or inclusion under “sugar alcohols” on the nutrition label. If you are sensitive to polyols, start with small portions to gauge your tolerance—and never share these products with dogs.
