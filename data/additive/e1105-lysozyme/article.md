Lysozyme (E1105) is an enzyme most often taken from hen egg whites and used as a preservative. In foods like certain cheeses and some wines, it helps keep unwanted bacteria in check and protects quality.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural enzyme from egg whites; also sold as lysozyme hydrochloride. Used as a preservative.
- What it does: Targets specific bacteria by breaking down their cell walls, helping to prevent spoilage.
- Where it’s found: Hard and semi-hard cheeses, and some wines.
- Label names: “Lysozyme,” “lysozyme (from egg),” or “E1105.”
- Dietary notes: Made from eggs; not vegan. People with egg allergy should avoid it.

## Why is Lysozyme added to food?
Lysozyme is added to control certain bacteria that can spoil foods or disrupt fermentation, especially in dairy and wine. In winemaking, U.S. regulators authorize its use to manage lactic acid bacteria during fermentation and storage, helping winemakers steer microbial growth without using heat or harsher treatments.[^1]

## What foods contain Lysozyme?
You’ll most often see lysozyme in:
- Cheese: Commonly used in hard and semi-hard varieties to reduce bacterial spoilage during ripening.[^2]
- Wine: Employed by some wineries to manage lactic acid bacteria before or during malolactic fermentation.[^1]

It may show up on ingredient lists simply as “lysozyme,” sometimes followed by “(from egg)” or “E1105.”

## What can replace Lysozyme?
Alternatives depend on the food and the target microbes:
- Cheeses: Consider [nisin](/e234-nisin){.additive} or [natamycin](/e235-natamycin){.additive} for surface or starter culture control.
- General preservation: [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} or [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} can suppress yeasts and molds in certain foods.
- Wine: Sulfites such as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide){.additive} or [potassium metabisulphite](/e224-potassium-metabisulphite){.additive} are common, though they play a broader antioxidant and antimicrobial role.

## How is Lysozyme made?
Commercial food-grade lysozyme is typically produced by:
1) separating and clarifying egg whites,
2) isolating the lysozyme protein through filtration and ion-exchange steps,
3) purifying and concentrating the enzyme, and
4) drying it as a powder; it may be converted to a hydrochloride salt to improve solubility and shelf life.

## Is Lysozyme safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has re-evaluated lysozyme (E1105) and found no safety concern at the permitted uses and levels in foods.[^2] The main issue is allergenicity: because it is derived from egg white, it can trigger reactions in people with egg allergy. Eggs are one of the major food allergens recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[^3]

## Does Lysozyme have any benefits?
- Quality and consistency: It helps cheesemakers keep unwanted bacteria in check during ripening, supporting a reliable texture and flavor.
- Winemaking support: It provides a tool to manage lactic acid bacteria, helping maintain microbial balance without excessive heat or additives that could affect aroma.

## Who should avoid Lysozyme?
- Anyone with an egg allergy should avoid foods containing lysozyme, since it is an egg-derived protein.[^3]
- People following vegan diets, or egg-free dietary or religious practices, may also choose to avoid it.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Lysozyme is a synthetic chemical preservative.
  Fact: It’s a natural enzyme typically isolated from hen egg whites.
- Myth: If it’s in wine, it must be listed on the front label.
  Fact: It may not appear prominently; check the ingredient statement or winery technical notes when available.
- Myth: Lysozyme is the same as all other “enzymes.”
  Fact: Enzymes are a broad group; lysozyme specifically targets bonds in certain bacterial cell walls.

## Lysozyme in branded foods
On cheese labels, look for “lysozyme,” “lysozyme (from egg),” or “E1105.” Wine labels may not always list processing aids clearly; check producer websites or technical sheets if you want to confirm its use. If you have an egg allergy, treat any mention of lysozyme as a clear signal to avoid the product.
