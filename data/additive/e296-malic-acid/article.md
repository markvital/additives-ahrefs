Malic acid (E296) is a tart-tasting organic acid that gives foods a clean, fruity sourness. It helps control acidity, sharpen flavor, and keep certain products stable.

## At a glance
Here is the short version.
- What it is: A food acid with a bright, long-lasting tart taste.
- Where you’ll see it: Drinks, candies, fruit fillings, chewing gum, and many flavored snacks.
- What it does: Regulates acidity (pH) and acts as a flavoring agent.
- Status: Allowed in both the U.S. and EU when used as intended; the EU authorizes the L-form as E296.
- Taste note: Often used with or instead of other acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} for a smoother sour profile.

## Why is Malic acid added to food?
Malic acid is added to make foods taste pleasantly tart and to control acidity so products keep the right pH. In the EU, the authorized form is L‑malic acid (E296), which is permitted as an acidity regulator and flavoring substance in many foods.[^3]

## What foods contain Malic acid?
You’re most likely to find malic acid in:
- Carbonated and still soft drinks
- Sour candies and chewing gum
- Fruit spreads, pie fillings, and flavored dairy or plant-based desserts
- Baked goods, gelatins, and puddings

In the U.S., malic acid is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) as a flavoring agent and adjuvant when used at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice, in foods such as baked goods, beverages, gelatins, and puddings.[^1]

## What can replace Malic acid?
Choices depend on taste, pH target, and processing needs:
- For bright, quick sourness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}
- For sharper, wine-like tartness: [tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid){.additive}
- For strong sourness at low use levels: [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid){.additive}
- For mild, dairy-friendly acidity: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid){.additive}
- For buffering or salt forms: [sodium malates](/e350-sodium-malates){.additive} or [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate){.additive}
- For specialty profiles: [succinic acid](/e363-succinic-acid){.additive}

## How is Malic acid made?
Food-grade malic acid can be produced in two main ways. The DL‑form is typically made by chemical hydration of maleic or fumaric acid, while the L‑form can be obtained by fermentation or by enzymatic conversion of fumaric acid using food-grade microbes or enzymes.[^2]

## Is Malic acid safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the U.S., malic acid is GRAS as a flavoring agent and adjuvant at levels not to exceed good manufacturing practice.[^1] In Europe, the EFSA panel re‑evaluated L‑malic acid (E296) and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels.[^2]

## Does Malic acid have any benefits?
In foods, malic acid:
- Provides a smooth, persistent sourness that enhances fruit flavors
- Helps set and maintain pH, which can support flavor stability and texture
- Works well alongside other acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} and [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid){.additive} to fine‑tune taste

## Who should avoid Malic acid?
Most people can consume foods with malic acid without issues. Those sensitive to acidic foods—such as people with frequent heartburn, active mouth ulcers, or very sensitive teeth—may prefer to limit highly sour products. Acidic drinks and candies can contribute to tooth erosion if consumed often and held in the mouth; rinsing with water and not sipping for long periods can help reduce risk.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- “E‑numbers are always artificial.” False. E‑numbers also include substances that occur in nature; they’re simply identifiers used in the EU.
- “Malic acid is the same as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}.” False. Both are food acids, but they differ in taste profile, pKa values, and how they perform in recipes.
- “Natural and synthetic malic acid act differently.” In food use, the same form (for example, L‑malic acid) behaves the same regardless of how it was made.

## Malic acid in branded foods
You’ll usually see “malic acid” on U.S. ingredient lists, and “E296” or “L‑malic acid” on EU labels. Related salts may appear as “[sodium malates](/e350-sodium-malates){.additive}” or “[potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate){.additive}.” Check the ingredients of sodas, sour candies, chewing gums, fruit fillings, flavored chips, and powdered drink mixes if you’re looking to find—or avoid—it.
