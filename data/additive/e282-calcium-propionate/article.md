Calcium propionate (E282) is a preservative that helps keep bread and other baked goods fresh by slowing the growth of mold. It is widely approved by food safety authorities and used at low levels that follow good manufacturing practice.

## At a glance
Here are the essentials about calcium propionate.

- E-number: E282; listed on labels as “calcium propionate” or “E282” in many countries
- Role: preservative that inhibits mold and some bacteria in bakery and other foods
- Common in: sliced bread, rolls, tortillas, cakes, some dairy-style products, and certain meat and poultry items
- Regulation: affirmed as safe for use under U.S. law and authorized in the European Union when used as intended
- Taste and texture: typically does not change flavor when used at normal levels
- Storage help: extends shelf life, which can reduce food waste

## Why is calcium propionate added to food?
Manufacturers use calcium propionate to keep foods from spoiling too quickly. It is the calcium salt of propionic acid, and it works by making the environment less friendly to mold and some spoilage bacteria.[^5] This helps bread and similar foods stay fresher for longer without noticeable changes in taste or texture.

## What foods contain calcium propionate?
You will most often find calcium propionate in baked goods such as sliced bread, buns, rolls, tortillas, and pastries, where mold control is essential. It is also authorized for use in a range of food categories in the European Union, where it appears on ingredient lists as “E 282.”[^2] In the United States, it is considered a safe and suitable ingredient for certain meat and poultry products when used as specified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[^4]

## What can replace calcium propionate?
There are several ways to manage mold without calcium propionate, depending on the food and shelf life needed.
- Other preservatives: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} and [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} are common mold inhibitors in many foods. [Benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid){.additive} and [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} may be options in acidic products.
- Process changes: sourdough fermentation, lower pH (for example, using [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive}), tighter moisture control, improved packaging, or modified atmosphere can also slow spoilage.
- Shorter shelf life: for fresh bakery items, faster turnover and refrigeration can help, though it may change the product’s texture.

## How is calcium propionate made?
Food-grade calcium propionate is typically produced by neutralizing propionic acid with a calcium source such as [calcium hydroxide](/e526-calcium-hydroxide){.additive} or [calcium carbonate](/e170i-calcium-carbonate){.additive}.[^5] In the European Union, it must also meet identity and purity criteria set out for food additives.[^3]

## Is calcium propionate safe to eat?
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists calcium propionate as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, E282 is an authorized preservative under the food additives framework regulation, which permits its use in specified food categories and conditions.[^2]

## Does calcium propionate have any benefits?
The main benefit is simple: it helps keep food safe and fresh by slowing mold growth, which supports longer shelf life and can cut food waste. It also supplies a small amount of calcium, though it is not intended to be a major calcium source.

## Who should avoid calcium propionate?
Most people do not need to avoid calcium propionate. Individuals who are following a preservative-free eating plan, or who have been advised by a healthcare professional to limit certain additives, can check labels for “calcium propionate” or “E282.” People who notice personal sensitivity to bakery preservatives can choose fresh, short-shelf-life products or options made without added preservatives.

## Myths & facts
- “It isn’t approved by food authorities.” Fact: In the U.S., calcium propionate is affirmed as GRAS when used properly; in the EU, it is authorized as E282 under the additives regulation.[^1][^2]
- “It’s an antibiotic.” Fact: It is a food preservative. It inhibits mold and some bacteria in foods but is not used as a medical antibiotic.[^2]
- “It adds a lot of calcium.” Fact: It contributes only a small amount of calcium at typical use levels; it is not a meaningful calcium supplement.

## calcium propionate in branded foods
You can spot calcium propionate on ingredient lists for many sliced breads, burger buns, tortillas, bagels, and sweet baked goods. Some processed cheese-style items and ready-to-eat meat or poultry products may also use it where permitted. To check, read the ingredient list for “calcium propionate,” “calcium propanoate,” or “E282.”
