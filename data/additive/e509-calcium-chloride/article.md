Calcium chloride (E509) is a simple calcium salt used to help foods keep their shape, set properly, and stay stable. You’ll most often see it in canned tomatoes and some cheeses where it helps firm texture and support coagulation. It is widely permitted in the U.S. and EU when used in line with good manufacturing practice.

## At a glance
Calcium chloride is a food-grade mineral salt that helps texture and stability.

- What it does: stabiliser, thickener, and coagulant
- Where it appears: canned tomato products, certain cheeses, and some processed fruits and vegetables
- Label names: “Calcium chloride” or “E509” (in the EU)
- Dietary notes: adds calcium but usually in small amounts; taste impact is minimal at typical use levels

## Why is Calcium chloride added to food?
Manufacturers use calcium chloride to strengthen cell walls, help proteins set, and keep foods from getting soft or watery. In U.S. regulations, it is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for direct addition to food, used at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice, which covers roles such as firming and stabilizing textures.[^1]

## What foods contain Calcium chloride?
You’ll most commonly find E509 in shelf-stable products where firmness matters.

- Canned tomatoes and similar tomato products, where it helps tomato pieces stay intact during processing and storage[^2]
- Some cheeses and dairy preparations to support coagulation and consistent curd formation (allowed as a safe and suitable ingredient under various standards)
- Certain processed fruits and vegetables that need help holding their shape during canning or packing

Label reading tip: it typically appears in the ingredient list as “Calcium chloride” or, in Europe, “E509.”

## What can replace Calcium chloride?
Depending on the job it’s doing, several additives can stand in:

- For coagulation or setting: [calcium sulphate](/e516-calcium-sulphate){.additive}, [magnesium chloride](/e511-magnesium-chloride){.additive}, or [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone){.additive}
- For firming or gelling in plant tissues: [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive} or [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- For calcium fortification or buffering: [calcium carbonates](/e170-calcium-carbonates){.additive} or acidulants like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} used alongside calcium sources

The best substitute depends on the food matrix, pH, and the texture target.

## How is Calcium chloride made?
Food-grade calcium chloride is commonly produced by neutralizing hydrochloric acid with a calcium source such as limestone (calcium carbonate). It is also obtained as a byproduct of the Solvay process used in soda ash manufacturing, then purified to food specifications.[^3]

## Is Calcium chloride safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, calcium chloride is affirmed as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, E509 is an authorized food additive with defined purity criteria, meaning it must meet strict compositional and contaminant limits before it can be used in foods.[^4]

As with many additives, the amounts used in foods are small and are chosen to achieve a technical effect without materially changing the product’s nutrition or flavor.

## Does Calcium chloride have any benefits?
Technologically, it helps foods hold their shape, improves curd formation in dairy, and reduces texture loss in heat-processed produce. Nutritionally, it contributes a small amount of calcium. Calcium itself is an essential mineral for bones, muscles, and nerves; however, the quantity from E509 at typical use levels is modest compared with dietary sources like milk, yogurt, or leafy greens.[^5]

## Who should avoid Calcium chloride?
Most people don’t need to avoid foods containing E509. Individuals who must limit calcium intake—for example, those with hypercalcemia or certain kidney conditions—should follow medical advice about total calcium from all sources, including supplements and fortified foods.[^5] If you’re managing a specific medical condition, ask a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as road de-icer.” Food-grade calcium chloride must meet tight purity standards; products for de-icing are not made to food specifications.[^4]
- “It makes food very salty.” At food-use levels, E509 is used for texture, not for flavoring, and is typically present in small amounts.
- “It’s not allowed in the EU.” E509 is authorized in the EU with specifications for identity and purity.[^4]

## Calcium chloride in branded foods
You’ll often see calcium chloride on labels for:
- Canned tomatoes, diced tomatoes, and tomato wedges
- Jarred vegetables like peppers or pickles
- Some cheeses and dairy preparations
- Certain canned or jarred fruits where firmness is important

On packaging, it may appear as “Calcium chloride” or “E509.” Presence varies by brand and recipe, so check the ingredient list.
