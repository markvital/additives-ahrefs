Calcium citrates (E333) are the calcium salts of citric acid. They act mainly as acidity regulators and metal binders (sequestrants), and they are also used to add calcium to foods and drinks. You’ll most often see them listed as “calcium citrate” on labels.

## At a glance
A quick guide to what this additive is and does.

- Names you might see: E333, calcium citrate, calcium citrates
- What it does: controls acidity, stabilises products, binds trace metals, adds calcium
- Where it’s used: beverages (including juices), plant milks, jams and preserves, confectionery, and some processed foods
- Forms: [monocalcium citrate](/e333i-monocalcium-citrate), [dicalcium citrate](/e333ii-dicalcium-citrate), and [tricalcium citrate](/e333iii-tricalcium-citrate)
- Related additives: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)

## Why is Calcium citrates added to food?
Manufacturers use E333 to keep acidity steady and to prevent off-flavors that can be triggered by metal ions in water or ingredients. In technical terms, it works as an acidity regulator and a sequestrant, helping foods taste consistent and stay stable over shelf life.[^4]

## What foods contain Calcium citrates?
E333 shows up in many everyday items. You might find it in:
- Beverages and juice drinks (often where calcium is added)
- Plant-based milks and yogurts
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preparations
- Confectionery and desserts
- Some processed meats, sauces, and canned or bottled foods

In the European Union, calcium citrates are authorized across a wide range of food categories, generally at “quantum satis” levels (use as much as needed to achieve the effect, but no more). Safety reviews by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have not identified concerns at reported uses and levels.[^1]

## What can replace Calcium citrates?
Depending on the job it’s doing, common stand-ins include:
- For acidity control or buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- For calcium fortification: [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates) or [calcium chloride](/e509-calcium-chloride) when taste and solubility fit
- For binding metals (sequestration) or stabilizing: certain phosphate systems such as [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or [potassium phosphates](/e340-potassium-phosphates), chosen to match taste and label needs

## How is Calcium citrates made?
Food-grade calcium citrates are produced by neutralizing citric acid with a calcium source such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide, then filtering and drying to meet purity criteria.[^2] The underlying citric acid is typically made by fermenting sugars with safe, food-grade microorganisms, a well-established industrial process.[^5]

## Is Calcium citrates safe to eat?
Based on EFSA’s re-evaluation of citric acid and its sodium, potassium, and calcium salts (E330–E333), there was no safety concern for the reported uses and use levels in foods, and a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^1]

## Does Calcium citrates have any benefits?
Yes. In addition to its role in taste and stability, calcium citrate is a useful source of dietary calcium in fortified foods and supplements. Unlike some other calcium salts, it can be taken with or without meals because it does not depend as much on stomach acid for absorption.[^3]

## Who should avoid Calcium citrates?
Most people can consume foods containing E333 without issues. However:
- Individuals who must limit calcium (for example, those with hypercalcemia or certain kidney conditions) should follow medical advice about total calcium from diet and supplements.[^3]
- Calcium can interact with some medicines by reducing how well they’re absorbed (such as certain antibiotics, bisphosphonates, and levothyroxine). Take these medicines at a different time from calcium-containing products if your healthcare provider advises it.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as citric acid.” Not quite. Calcium citrates are salts made from citric acid plus calcium; they are less tart and behave differently in recipes.
- “It’s only for sourness.” E333 also buffers pH, binds trace metals, and can add calcium—so it does more than affect taste.
- “It’s artificial and unsafe.” Food-grade calcium citrates are made using well-known processes and have been evaluated by major regulators for safety at allowed uses.

## Calcium citrates in branded foods
You’ll usually see it listed as “calcium citrate” or “E333” on the ingredient list. It often appears in calcium-fortified juices and plant milks, fruit spreads, candies, and shelf-stable sauces. Placement on the label can vary: in beverages it may be near other minerals, while in jams it may sit alongside acids and gelling agents.
