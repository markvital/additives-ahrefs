      "a": "E217 isn’t a currency—it’s a preservative (sodium propyl paraben). Its price varies by supplier, purity, and order size and may be hard to source for food use since it’s not authorized in the EU; request current USD quotes from chemical suppliers.",

      "q": "what is start link method in e217",
      "a": "There’s no recognized “start link method” for E217. Where permitted, it’s simply used as an antimicrobial preservative by dissolving and mixing the sodium salt uniformly into the product at low levels to inhibit molds and yeasts; note it is not authorized as a food additive in the EU.",
