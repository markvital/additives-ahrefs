Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E218), also called methylparaben, is a preservative used to slow the growth of molds and yeasts in some foods and drinks. It appears on labels under names like methylparaben, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, or E218, and its use and limits vary by country. It is also used outside of food, such as in cosmetics and medicines in many markets.

## At a glance
Here are the basics about E218 in a quick list.

- What it is: a preservative from the paraben family that helps keep foods from spoiling by mold and yeast.
- Other names: methylparaben, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, E218 (also called INS 218).
- How it looks: typically a white crystalline powder with little to no odor or taste.
- Where it’s used: allowed in some countries for certain foods and beverages; also common in non-food products like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
- Label check: look for “methylparaben,” “methyl p-hydroxybenzoate,” or “E218.”

## Why is Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
It is added to stop or slow the growth of spoilage organisms, especially yeasts and molds, which helps extend shelf life and maintain quality.[^2] In practical use, it can be paired with other preservatives to cover a wider range of microbes and to suit the food’s pH and formulation.[^3] Because methylparaben dissolves only modestly in water, manufacturers sometimes use its more soluble sodium salt, [sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e219-sodium-methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), when appropriate.

## What foods contain Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Where it is permitted, E218 may appear in selected categories such as beverages, syrups, confections, and some pickled or preserved products, always within national limits and good manufacturing practice.[^3] Actual use varies by country and by brand, and many manufacturers today choose alternatives like [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) instead.

## What can replace Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Food makers often reach for other, widely used preservatives when E218 is not desired or not permitted:

- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) and [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate) for yeasts and molds in many foods.
- [Benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) and [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) for acidic beverages and syrups.
- [Propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid) and [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate) for baked goods.
- Fermented or “natural” options like [nisin](/e234-nisin), [natamycin](/e235-natamycin), or antioxidant [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary), depending on the product.

## How is Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate made?
E218 is the methyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, produced by reacting p-hydroxybenzoic acid with methanol using typical food-grade manufacturing methods and then purifying the product.[^2][^4] Official specifications describe its identity and purity requirements for use as a food additive.[^4]

## Is Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
Safety depends on dose and the type of food, which is why regulations set strict conditions for use. The Codex Alimentarius (an international food standards program run by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization) lists E218 as a preservative with maximum levels in specific food categories; countries decide if and how to adopt those provisions.[^3] In the United States, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate is permitted as a synthetic flavoring substance and adjuvant under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which signals regulatory acceptance for limited food use when good manufacturing practice is followed.[^1]

## Does Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
Yes. By controlling yeasts and molds, E218 can help reduce food waste, keep flavors stable longer, and support food safety by slowing spoilage. It can also lessen the need for very high heat treatments in some foods, which helps preserve taste and texture.

## Who should avoid Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
People with a diagnosed sensitivity or allergy to parabens should check labels and avoid products that list methylparaben or E218. Most reported reactions involve skin exposure from cosmetics; if you have a known paraben allergy, talk to your clinician about dietary avoidance as well.[^5] As with any additive, those following medical advice for specific conditions should consult their healthcare provider.

## Myths & facts
A few common points can help clear up confusion.

- “E218 is banned everywhere.” Fact: It remains authorized for defined uses in some jurisdictions and appears in official additive specifications, such as the European Union’s additive specification regulation.[^4]
- “It’s only a cosmetic ingredient.” Fact: Codex lists methyl p-hydroxybenzoate as a food preservative with category-specific uses; some countries allow it in foods under strict limits.[^3]
- “All parabens are the same.” Fact: Different parabens and their sodium salts have different E-numbers (for example, [ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e214-ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), [propyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e216-propyl-para-hydroxybenzoate), and [sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate](/e219-sodium-methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate)) and may have different permissions by country.

## Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate in branded foods
Labeling is the best guide because brand use changes over time. Look for “methylparaben,” “methyl p-hydroxybenzoate,” or “E218” on the ingredient list, especially on beverages, syrups, confections, and preserved products in markets where this preservative is allowed.
