      "q": "what does benzoin resin smell like",
      "a": "Sweet, warm, balsamic and vanilla-like with hints of honey and spice; Sumatra benzoin tends to be more balsamic/woody due to its cinnamic acid content, while Siam benzoin is softer and more vanillic.",

      "q": "benzoin sumatra resin how to use",
      "a": "Burn small granules as incense on charcoal or an electric/mica burner, or make a tincture/resinoid in high-proof ethanol for use as a fixative or trace flavor where permitted. Use sparingly and follow local food regulations; it can be a skin/respiratory sensitizer.",

      "q": "how many protons does e906 get per spill",

      "q": "how to dilute benzoin resin",
      "a": "Crush and macerate it in food-grade high-proof ethanol (about 1:5 to 1:10 w/v) for several days, then filter to make a tincture; it is not water‑soluble. For non-food fragrance use, it can also be diluted in carriers like dipropylene glycol or benzyl benzoate—use only food-grade solvents for edible applications.",
