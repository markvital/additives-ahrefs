Black 7984 (E152) is a synthetic black colorant also known as Food Black 2 and, in common use, carbon black. It produces a deep, jet-black tone, but it is not approved today as a direct food color in either the European Union or the United States, where other black colorants are used instead.

## At a glance
This section highlights the essentials in simple terms.

- What it is: a petroleum-derived black pigment designed to color foods.
- What it does: gives a strong, stable black shade that resists heat and light.
- Where it’s allowed: it is not authorized as a food color in the European Union or the United States.
- What replaces it: products usually use [vegetable carbon](/e153-vegetable-carbon), [caramel](/e150-caramel), [Brilliant Black BN](/e151-brilliant-black-bn), or blends of permitted colors.

## Why is Black 7984 added to food?
Manufacturers have used Black 7984 to create a deep black appearance in items like icings, confectionery, and decorative coatings. The pigment is very effective at masking other colors and holds up well during cooking and storage.

## What foods contain Black 7984?
In the European Union and the United States, you generally will not find Black 7984 in foods because it is not approved as a direct food color in these markets.[^1][^2] Where it has been used historically, it has typically appeared in dark candies, bakery decorations, and certain specialty products. If you buy imported goods, always check the ingredient list for “E152,” “Black 7984,” “Food Black 2,” or “carbon black.”

## What can replace Black 7984?
Food makers usually turn to these options:
- [Vegetable carbon (E153)](/e153-vegetable-carbon) for a plant-based black.
- [Caramel (E150)](/e150-caramel) classes for brown-to-black tones.
- [Brilliant Black BN (E151)](/e151-brilliant-black-bn) for regulated black shades where allowed.
- Blends of permitted colors such as [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf), [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red), and [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) to achieve dark gray or near-black.
- For surface coloring in specific applications, some markets allow [iron oxides and hydroxides](/e172-iron-oxides-and-iron-hydroxides), including [black iron oxide](/e172i-black-iron-oxide), subject to local rules.

## How is Black 7984 made?
“Carbon black” grades used for coloration are typically produced by the furnace black process, which involves the incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of heavy petroleum products or natural gas. This yields very fine elemental carbon particles that are collected, pelletized, and standardized for use as pigments.[^3]

## Is Black 7984 safe to eat?
Regulatory agencies in the European Union and the United States have not authorized Black 7984 for direct addition to foods as a color additive.[^1][^2] However, both regions allow certain high‑purity forms of carbon black in food‑contact plastics under strict specifications, which is different from using it as an ingredient in food.[^4][^5]

For worker safety and environmental health, carbon black has been evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which classifies it as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B) based mainly on inhalation studies in animals, not on eating it in food.[^6] This occupational classification does not establish safety for ingestion and helps explain why many regulators have limited its use in foods.

## Does Black 7984 have any benefits?
Aside from providing strong color, Black 7984 does not add taste, aroma, or nutrition. Its value is cosmetic—deep, uniform black that is stable in many processing conditions.

## Who should avoid Black 7984?
- Shoppers in the EU and U.S. will rarely need to avoid it, because it is not approved as a food color and is unlikely to appear on labels in these markets.[^1][^2]
- If you prefer plant-derived colors, choose products colored with [vegetable carbon](/e153-vegetable-carbon) or caramel instead of petroleum‑derived pigments.
- If you are cautious about potential impurities in petroleum‑based colors, know that food‑contact uses of carbon black are tightly controlled for purity in both the EU and U.S., but that does not translate to approval for eating it as a colorant.[^4][^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Black 7984 is the same as [vegetable carbon](/e153-vegetable-carbon). Fact: They are different. E153 comes from plant materials; E152 refers to a petroleum‑derived carbon pigment.
- Myth: Black 7984 is allowed everywhere. Fact: It is not permitted as a food color in the EU or U.S.; always check local regulations.
- Myth: “Activated charcoal” and Black 7984 are interchangeable. Fact: Activated charcoal relates to E153 uses; Black 7984 is a different material with a different regulatory status.

## Black 7984 in branded foods
You are unlikely to find Black 7984 listed on mainstream EU or U.S. products. If you see “E152,” “Black 7984,” “Food Black 2,” or “carbon black” on a label, the product may be from a market where this color is treated differently. When in doubt, contact the manufacturer or consult local regulations.
