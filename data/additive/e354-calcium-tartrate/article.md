Calcium tartrate (E354) is the calcium salt of L(+)‑tartaric acid, a naturally occurring fruit acid best known from grapes. Food makers use it in small amounts mainly to help control acidity and stabilize texture in certain products.

## At a glance
- Also called E354; it’s the calcium salt of L(+)-tartaric acid.
- Used as an acidity regulator, buffer, and stabilizer in some foods.
- Heat-stable and neutral in taste at typical use levels.
- Suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets; not known as a common allergen.
- Typically present at low levels and labeled as “calcium tartrate” or “E354.”

## Why is calcium tartrate added to food?
Manufacturers add calcium tartrate to fine‑tune acidity and keep products stable during shelf life. As a tartrate salt, it can act as a buffer, helping foods hold a consistent pH, which supports taste, color, and texture. In the European Union (EU), E354 is an authorised additive within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives.[^2]

## What foods contain calcium tartrate?
In the EU, its use is limited to specific food categories and levels listed in the Union list of approved additives (Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, as amended). That list sets in which foods E354 may be used and under what conditions, so it will not appear in every product type.[^3] When present, you’ll find it in the ingredient list as “calcium tartrate” or “E354.”

## What can replace calcium tartrate?
Depending on the recipe and goal, formulators may consider:
- Other tartrates: [L(+)-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), [sodium tartrates](/e335-sodium-tartrates), or [potassium tartrates](/e336-potassium-tartrates).
- Alternative acidity regulators: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid).

## How is calcium tartrate made?
Food‑grade calcium tartrate is produced from L(+)-tartaric acid and a permitted calcium source (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate), then purified to meet identity and purity criteria. EU specifications require the L(+) configuration and set limits for contaminants to ensure consistent quality.[^1]

## Is calcium tartrate safe to eat?
Calcium tartrate is on the EU list of approved food additives, which means it has been assessed for safety and is permitted only under defined conditions of use.[^2] Its identity and purity requirements are laid out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which also restricts it to the L(+) form used in foods.[^1]

## Does calcium tartrate have any benefits?
- Technical: Helps maintain a stable, predictable acidity, which can protect flavor and texture over shelf life.
- Formulation: As a calcium salt, it is less sour than the free acid, allowing milder flavor impact while still regulating pH.
- Processing: Good heat stability makes it suitable for cooked and baked products where pH control matters.

## Who should avoid calcium tartrate?
Most people do not need to avoid E354. As with many acid regulators, very high intakes may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, but typical amounts in foods are small. Individuals under medical guidance to limit certain food acids should consult their healthcare professional about tartrates in general. In the EU, its use is limited to authorised foods and levels, helping to manage consumer exposure.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Calcium tartrate is the same as cream of tartar.”  
  Fact: Cream of tartar is potassium bitartrate, a different salt of tartaric acid; calcium tartrate is a separate compound in the same family.
- Myth: “It adds a strong sour taste.”  
  Fact: As a calcium salt, it’s less tart than the free acid; it is used to regulate acidity without strongly souring the product.
- Myth: “It’s an aluminum additive.”  
  Fact: There is no aluminum in calcium tartrate; it is a calcium salt of tartaric acid.

## Calcium tartrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you may see:
- Calcium tartrate
- E354
Some labels also include a functional class, for example: “acidity regulator: calcium tartrate (E354).”
