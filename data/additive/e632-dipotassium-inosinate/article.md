Dipotassium inosinate (E632) is a flavor enhancer that boosts the savory, umami taste in foods. It is the dipotassium salt of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) and is used at very low levels to make seasonings, snacks, and soups taste richer.

## At a glance
- Name: Dipotassium inosinate; also listed as E632
- What it does: Flavor enhancer that amplifies savory (umami) taste
- Typical foods: Savory snacks, instant noodles, soups, bouillon, sauces, and spice blends
- Often used with: Umami boosters like [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} and nucleotide salts such as [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate){.additive} or [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive}
- Appearance: White, water‑soluble powder or granules
- Regulation: Authorized as a food additive in the EU; appears by name on U.S. ingredient labels

## Why is Dipotassium inosinate added to food?
It is added to intensify savory flavors. Inosinate salts are especially effective when used together with glutamates such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} or with guanylate salts, creating a strong umami effect at very low doses.[^2]

## What foods contain Dipotassium inosinate?
You’ll most often find E632 in:
- Instant noodles, ramen seasonings, and soup mixes
- Bouillon cubes and liquid broths
- Savory snacks like potato chips and corn snacks
- Ready sauces, gravies, and marinades
- Spice blends and seasoning powders

On labels, it may appear as “Dipotassium inosinate,” “E632,” or “flavor enhancer (E632).”

## What can replace Dipotassium inosinate?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe and labeling rules:
- [Monosodium glutamate (MSG)](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive} for umami strength
- Other nucleotide enhancers: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate){.additive}, [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive}, or [dipotassium guanylate](/e628-dipotassium-guanylate){.additive}
- Mixed nucleotides: [disodium 5-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide){.additive}
- Umami-rich ingredients like yeast extracts, mushrooms, tomato concentrates, or aged cheeses (in products that permit them)

## How is Dipotassium inosinate made?
Under EU specifications, E632 is defined as the dipotassium salt of inosine 5′‑monophosphate (IMP) and must meet strict purity criteria.[^1] Commercial production typically neutralizes 5′‑inosinic acid with potassium to form the highly soluble dipotassium salt.[^1]

## Is Dipotassium inosinate safe to eat?
E632 is an authorized food additive in the European Union (E-number system) under the EU food additives framework.[^5] In the United States, ingredients like dipotassium inosinate must be declared by their common or usual name on the ingredient list so consumers can identify them.[^3]

## Does Dipotassium inosinate have any benefits?
Its benefit is culinary, not nutritional: it boosts savory taste so products can achieve a fuller flavor at low use levels. It works particularly well when combined with glutamates such as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}.[^2]

## Who should avoid Dipotassium inosinate?
- People who choose to avoid flavor enhancers like MSG sometimes also avoid inosinate/guanylate additives, because they are often used together in savory snacks and seasonings.
- Those advised to follow a purine‑restricted diet (for example, due to gout or high uric acid) may prefer to limit added sources of purine nucleotides, including inosinate, after discussing with their healthcare provider.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E632 is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are different additives; inosinate salts are nucleotides, while MSG is a glutamate salt. They are often paired to strengthen umami.
- Myth: “It makes foods very salty.” Fact: E632 contributes savory taste, not saltiness, and is used at very low levels.
- Myth: “You can’t tell if it’s in your food.” Fact: In the U.S., it must be listed by its common or usual name on the ingredient list, and in the EU it may appear as E632.

## Dipotassium inosinate in branded foods
Look for “Dipotassium inosinate,” “E632,” or “flavor enhancer (E632)” on ingredient lists. It frequently appears alongside [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}, [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate){.additive}, or [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate){.additive} in savory snacks, noodles, broths, and seasonings. If you’re avoiding umami enhancers, scan the label for “inosinate,” “guanylate,” or the E-numbers E631–E635.
