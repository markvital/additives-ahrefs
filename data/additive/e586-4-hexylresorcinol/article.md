4‑Hexylresorcinol (E586) is a synthetic antioxidant used in a small number of foods to help maintain color and slow unwanted browning. In the European Union it appears on labels as E586 and is only allowed in specific foods and amounts defined by law.[^1]

## At a glance

- What it is: 4‑Hexylresorcinol (also called 4‑hexyl‑1,3‑benzenediol) is a phenolic compound used as a food antioxidant.
- What it does: Helps protect foods from discoloration by slowing oxidation, which can keep color and quality for longer.[^1]
- Where it’s used: Authorised uses are limited and set in the EU “Union list” of food additives; purity criteria are laid down in a separate specification rule.[^1][^2]
- How it appears on labels: In the EU, by functional class (for example, “antioxidant”) followed by the name or “E586.”[^4]

## Why is 4-hexylresorcinol added to food?

Manufacturers add 4‑hexylresorcinol to slow chemical reactions that cause browning and color loss. In EU law, this role falls under the “antioxidant” functional class—additives used to prolong shelf life by protecting foods against oxidation.[^1]

## What foods contain 4-hexylresorcinol?

Use is not widespread. In the EU, it is allowed only in certain food categories and at set maximum levels listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 (the Union list). You will see it listed as “antioxidant: 4‑hexylresorcinol” or “antioxidant: E586” on the ingredient list when it is used.[^1][^4]

## What can replace 4-hexylresorcinol?

Suitable alternatives depend on the food and the reason for use:
- To manage browning or color changes: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), [calcium ascorbate](/e302-calcium-ascorbate), [erythorbic acid](/e315-erythorbic-acid), or [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate).
- To adjust acidity (which can also slow browning in some foods): [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid).
- To control spoilage by microbes (a different issue from browning): [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate).
- In some seafood products, processors also use sulphites such as [sulphur dioxide](/e220-sulphur-dioxide) or [sodium metabisulphite](/e223-sodium-metabisulphite); note that sulphites must be declared on labels and can cause sensitivity in some people.[^4]

## How is 4-hexylresorcinol made?

Food‑grade 4‑hexylresorcinol is produced by chemical synthesis and must meet identity and purity criteria set in EU specifications (for example, minimum assay and limits for impurities). These legal specifications are published in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is 4-hexylresorcinol safe to eat?

In the EU, a food additive can only be authorised if a scientific risk assessment shows it is safe for the intended uses, and if it serves a technological need. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) performs these assessments, and the European Commission sets the permitted food categories and maximum levels in law.[^3][^1] E586 also has EU purity criteria, which control its composition and contaminants.[^2] When used within these legal limits, it is considered safe for the general population.[^1][^3]

## Does 4-hexylresorcinol have any benefits?

- Helps maintain an appealing color by slowing oxidation.
- Can help reduce waste by extending the usable quality window of sensitive foods.
These are technological benefits that support food quality and shelf life within the permitted uses.[^1]

## Who should avoid 4-hexylresorcinol?

- If you aim to avoid certain food additives for personal reasons, check ingredient lists—EU rules require additives to be labeled by name or E‑number.[^4]
- If a healthcare professional has advised you to limit specific additives, follow their guidance.

## Myths & facts

- Myth: “An E‑number means an additive is harmful.”  
  Fact: An E‑number simply means the additive is authorised in the EU after a safety evaluation; it is a catalog number, not a risk rating.[^1][^3]

- Myth: “Antioxidants are only vitamins.”  
  Fact: In food law, “antioxidant” is a functional role. Additives with this role—including E586—are used to slow oxidation in foods.[^1]

- Myth: “Additives can be used at any level.”  
  Fact: The EU sets specific foods and maximum permitted levels for each authorised additive, and also purity criteria.[^1][^2]

## 4-hexylresorcinol in branded foods

E586 is uncommon, but when present in the EU you will see it in the ingredient list as “antioxidant: 4‑hexylresorcinol” or “antioxidant: E586.” Additives must be declared using their functional class plus name or E‑number, so checking the ingredient list is the easiest way to confirm whether it is used in a particular product.[^4]
