Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides (E488) are emulsifiers that help oil and water mix and stay mixed. They are made by adding small ethylene oxide units to mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, which improves whipping, aeration, and stability in many foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made by reacting mono- and diglycerides with ethylene oxide to add “ethoxy” groups.
- What it does: Helps mix oil and water, stabilizes foams, improves texture, and slows separation in foods.
- Where it’s used: Whipped toppings, bakery creams, cake mixes, non-dairy creamers, ice cream, sauces, and margarines.
- Label names: “Ethoxylated mono- and diglycerides,” sometimes shortened to “EMG.”
- Regulatory note: Defined and regulated in the EU with specific identity and purity criteria, including limits for certain processing residues.[^1]
- Diet notes: The fat source can be plant- or animal-derived; vegan or vegetarian status depends on the manufacturer. Used at low levels, so it contributes negligible calories per serving.

## Why is Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides added to food?
Food makers use E488 to keep oil and water phases together, which prevents separation and improves mouthfeel. It also helps trap and stabilize air bubbles, so products like whipped toppings and some cakes hold volume and stay creamy longer. In doughs and batters, it can support finer crumb structure and a softer texture.

## What foods contain Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides?
You’ll most often see E488 in:
- Whipped toppings and dessert creams
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Non-dairy creamers and powdered beverage mixes
- Cake mixes, bakery creams, and some breads
- Margarines and spreads
- Emulsified sauces and dressings

In the EU, authorized uses and any maximum levels are set out in the Union list of food additives; always check the ingredient list for the exact product you have.[^2]

## What can replace Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides?
Depending on the recipe, technologists might switch to:
- Other emulsifiers: [mono- and diglycerides (E471)](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [DATEM (E472e)](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lactic acid esters (E472b)](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol esters (E475)](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids), [propylene glycol esters (E477)](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids), or polysorbates such as [E433](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate).
- Natural options: [lecithins (E322)](/e322-lecithins).
- Stabilizers and thickeners to support texture: [xanthan gum (E415)](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum (E412)](/e412-guar-gum), [carrageenan (E407)](/e407-carrageenan), or [agar (E406)](/e406-agar).

The best substitute depends on the food’s fat content, processing, and target texture.

## How is Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides made?
Manufacturers start with mono- and diglycerides of edible fatty acids, then react them with ethylene oxide to graft short polyoxyethylene (“ethoxy”) chains onto the glyceride molecule. After reaction, the material is refined and tested to meet strict identity and purity specifications, including limits on process-related residuals such as ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane.[^1]

## Is Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides safe to eat?
In the European Union, E488 is an authorized food additive and must comply with its specification for identity and purity, which includes compositional ranges and contaminant limits.[^1] Its permitted food categories and any maximum use levels are set in the Union list under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and subsequent updates.[^2] When used within these legal conditions, regulators consider it safe for its intended uses in food.[^2]

## Does Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides have any benefits?
For manufacturers and consumers, E488 offers several practical advantages:
- Stable emulsions that resist separation during shelf life
- Better aeration and foam stability in whipped products
- Smoother, more uniform textures in sauces and creams
- Improved dispersion of fats, flavors, and colors in complex formulations

These benefits help maintain quality from factory to table, especially in products that undergo heating, whipping, chilling, or freeze–thaw cycles.

## Who should avoid Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides?
- People with known hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbates may wish to discuss products containing ethoxylated emulsifiers with their healthcare provider, because these substances share similar polyoxyethylene structures and rare cross-reactive allergies have been described in clinical guidance.[^3]
- Strict vegetarians and vegans should check with manufacturers, since the fatty acids used to make E488 can come from plant or animal sources.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to avoid certain emulsifiers should follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Because ethylene oxide is used in processing, E488 leaves dangerous amounts in food.” Fact: EU specifications set strict limits for residual processing substances in the additive itself, and manufacturers must comply with these limits.[^1]
- Myth: “E488 is the same as polysorbates.” Fact: Both are ethoxylated emulsifiers, but E488 is based on mono- and diglycerides, while polysorbates are sorbitan esters; they behave differently in some recipes.
- Myth: “It loads foods with extra calories.” Fact: It’s used at very low levels for functionality, so the calorie impact per serving is usually negligible.

## Ethoxylated Mono- and Di-Glycerides in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “Ethoxylated mono- and diglycerides” or “EMG.” You’ll often find it in shelf-stable whipped toppings, non-dairy creamers, certain cake mixes and bakery creams, some ice creams, and spreads. Recipes change by brand and country, so label reading is the best way to know what’s inside.
