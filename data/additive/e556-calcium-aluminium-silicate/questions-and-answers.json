      "q": "calcium silicate or sodium silicoaluminate which is worse",
      "a": "Both are permitted anti-caking agents with similar safety at legal use levels. Like E556 (calcium aluminium silicate), sodium aluminosilicate (E554) contains aluminium, whereas calcium silicate (E552) does not—so if you want to minimize aluminium exposure, calcium silicate may be preferable.",

      "q": "what is hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate",
      "a": "Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (often called HSCAS) is a zeolitic aluminosilicate containing sodium and calcium with water of crystallization. It’s related to E556 (calcium aluminium silicate) but is a distinct material used mainly as an anti-caking agent or in animal feed.",
