Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E479B) is an emulsifier used mainly in frying fats and oils. It helps oils perform better during high-heat cooking by keeping mixtures stable and reducing breakdown. You may see it on labels simply as E479b.

## At a glance
- E-number: E479B; function: emulsifier
- Made by heating refined soybean oil with mono- and diglycerides so they interact
- Used mostly in certain frying fats and oils, not widely seen in home pantry items
- Approved in the EU with detailed purity specifications
- Listed on labels as “E479b” or its full chemical name

## Why is Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
This additive helps oils and fats stay stable when heated. In practice, it acts as an emulsifier, improving the performance of frying oils and reducing issues like separation and foaming. In the EU, it is included on the list of permitted emulsifiers for use in specific categories of foods and fats.[^2]

## What foods contain Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
You are most likely to find E479B in certain vegetable oils and fats formulated for frying or pre-frying foods in commercial or industrial settings. Its use is regulated; in the EU it appears on the Union list of approved food additives, with restrictions on where and how it may be used.[^2]

## What can replace Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and process:
- Other emulsifiers for oil systems, such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate), or [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids).
- Antioxidants to help protect frying oils from breakdown, such as [tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq), [butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), or [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene).
- Anti-foam agents in fryers, like [dimethylpolysiloxane](/e900-dimethylpolysiloxane-and-methylphenylpolysiloxane), used alongside good oil management.
The best choice depends on the food, fryer conditions, and local rules.

## How is Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
E479B is produced by heating refined soybean oil with food-grade mono- and diglycerides so they interact under controlled oxidation. The EU specification defines the additive, its manufacturing approach, and purity criteria (including tests for components and unwanted residues).[^1]

## Is Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
In the European Union, E479B is authorised as a food additive. Authorisation includes a safety assessment and limits on where it can be used, plus a legally binding specification it must meet. When used as permitted and meeting those specifications, it is considered acceptable for use in food in the EU.[^2][^1]

## Does Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
For food makers and fry cooks, it can help frying oils last longer and perform more consistently. This can mean less foaming, better surface browning, and more uniform texture in fried foods. It is one tool—alongside proper oil turnover and temperature control—to keep frying quality steady.

## Who should avoid Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
People with soy allergy sometimes worry about soy-derived additives. Highly refined soybean oil is generally not considered a “major food allergen” in U.S. labeling law because refining removes soy proteins, the usual allergenic part.[^3] That said, anyone with a soy allergy should follow medical advice and read labels carefully.
If you must limit fat intake for health reasons, you may also choose to avoid foods fried in special-purpose oils containing this additive.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E479b is a plastic or synthetic polymer.” Fact: It is made from edible refined soybean oil reacted with mono- and diglycerides; it functions as an emulsifier in fats and oils.
- Myth: “It’s common in all packaged foods.” Fact: Its main use is in certain frying fats and oils, not across most everyday products.
- Myth: “If I’m allergic to soy, I’ll automatically react to E479b.” Fact: Highly refined soybean oil typically lacks soy proteins, which are the allergens; still, individuals should follow their clinician’s guidance.

## Thermally oxidised soya bean oil interacted with mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On ingredient lists, it may appear as “E479b” or by its full name. You are more likely to see it in professional or industrial frying contexts than in standard retail products. Availability and labeling can vary by country because approvals and permitted uses differ by jurisdiction.
