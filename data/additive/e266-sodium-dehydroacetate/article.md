Sodium dehydroacetate (E266) is a food additive that helps keep foods stable and fresh. It is the sodium salt of dehydroacetic acid and has antimicrobial properties, especially against molds and yeasts.

## At a glance
- What it is: the sodium salt of dehydroacetic acid, used in food technology.
- What it does: helps slow the growth of molds and yeasts; in some places it is also used as a flavoring aid.
- How it appears on labels: look for “sodium dehydroacetate” or, in regions that use E-numbers, “E266.”
- Typical use level: added at very low levels according to good manufacturing practice (GMP), meaning only as much as needed for the intended effect.

## Why is Sodium dehydroacetate added to food?
Food makers use sodium dehydroacetate because it inhibits the growth of certain molds and yeasts, helping foods stay fresh longer.[^2] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists sodium dehydroacetate as a synthetic flavoring substance and adjuvant that may be used in foods at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice (GMP), which means the minimum amount needed to achieve its purpose.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium dehydroacetate?
Use depends on local rules. To know whether a product contains it, check the ingredient list for “sodium dehydroacetate” or “E266.” It may appear alone or as part of a flavor preparation, depending on the country’s labeling requirements.

## What can replace Sodium dehydroacetate?
Alternatives depend on the recipe and the target microbes:
- Organic acid preservatives such as [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or its salt [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}
- Benzoates such as [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid){.additive}
- Propionates such as [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive}

Formulators often test a few options to match taste, pH, and shelf‑life needs.

## How is Sodium dehydroacetate made?
Chemically, sodium dehydroacetate is the sodium salt of dehydroacetic acid. Food-grade material must meet identity and purity specifications published by bodies such as the Codex Alimentarius (via JECFA, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives).[^3]

## Is Sodium dehydroacetate safe to eat?
When used as allowed by law and within good manufacturing practice limits, sodium dehydroacetate is considered safe for its approved uses.[^3] In the U.S., it appears on FDA’s list of synthetic flavoring substances and adjuvants permitted for use in food, which are used at the lowest level needed to achieve their function.[^1]

## Does Sodium dehydroacetate have any benefits?
Yes. By suppressing the growth of some molds and yeasts, it can help extend shelf life and keep foods tasting and smelling as intended for longer.[^2]

## Who should avoid Sodium dehydroacetate?
- Anyone who has been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid this specific additive.
- If you must strictly limit sodium intake, ask your clinician whether small amounts from additives like sodium dehydroacetate are relevant for your diet.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium dehydroacetate is a bleaching agent.” Fact: It is a sodium salt of an organic acid used in food technology, not a bleaching chemical.[^3]
- Myth: “It’s not allowed in U.S. foods.” Fact: FDA lists sodium dehydroacetate among synthetic flavoring substances permitted for use in foods at good manufacturing practice levels.[^1]
- Myth: “It is used in large amounts.” Fact: Approved uses require the minimum amount needed to do the job (GMP), which is typically very small.[^1]

## Sodium dehydroacetate in branded foods
Availability in branded products varies by country and by product type. The most reliable way to check is to read the ingredient list on the package or the manufacturer’s website for “sodium dehydroacetate” or “E266.”
