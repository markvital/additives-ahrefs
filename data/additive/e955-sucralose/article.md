Sucralose (E955) is a high‑intensity sweetener that is about 600 times sweeter than table sugar, yet used in tiny amounts. It provides sweetness with virtually no added calories and is approved for many foods and drinks in the U.S. and the EU.

## At a glance
- Name: Sucralose (E955)
- Type: High‑intensity sweetener
- Sweetness: Around 600× sweeter than sucrose (table sugar)
- Typical uses: “Diet” and “sugar‑free” drinks, flavored waters, chewing gum, desserts, yogurts, and tabletop sweeteners
- Regulatory status: Allowed in the U.S. and EU with established acceptable daily intakes (ADIs)

## Why is Sucralose added to food?
Food makers use sucralose to give strong sweetness without the calories and bulk of sugar. Because it is about 600 times sweeter than sugar, only a tiny amount is needed to sweeten a product.[^1] In the U.S., sucralose is permitted as a sweetener under federal regulations, which set its approved uses and purity specifications.[^3]

## What foods contain Sucralose?
Sucralose shows up in many “no sugar” or “reduced sugar” products:
- Zero‑sugar sodas and flavored waters
- Sugar‑free chewing gum and mints
- Light or reduced‑sugar yogurts, puddings, and gelatins
- Frozen desserts and pops
- Baked goods and baking mixes marketed as sugar‑free
- Tabletop sweeteners (packets, spoonable blends)

On labels, look for “sucralose,” “E955,” or a combination product (for example, sucralose used together with [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k)).

## What can replace Sucralose?
Depending on taste, cost, and recipe needs, common substitutes include:
- Other high‑intensity sweeteners: [aspartame](/e951-aspartame), [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k), [saccharin](/e954-saccharin-and-its-salts), [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides), [neotame](/e961-neotame), [advantame](/e969-advantame)
- Sugar alcohols (polyols) that add some bulk: [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [erythritol](/e968-erythritol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol)

Note: These options differ in taste, aftertaste, heat stability, and how they work in recipes.

## How is Sucralose made?
Sucralose is made from sucrose (table sugar) by replacing three of sugar’s hydroxyl groups with chlorine atoms. This small change makes the molecule intensely sweet and not readily used by the body for energy.[^4] In the U.S., regulations also include identity and purity specifications for sucralose used in food.[^3]

## Is Sucralose safe to eat?
Yes—major regulators have evaluated sucralose and set conservative limits for daily intake. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day.[^1] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) confirmed an ADI of 15 mg/kg body weight per day for E955 and found no safety concern at permitted uses and levels.[^2]

## Does Sucralose have any benefits?
- Helps reduce added sugars and calories while keeping sweetness in foods and drinks.
- Because very little is needed, it does not meaningfully change the weight or texture of many products.
- Suits a wide range of foods and beverages, including those that need a clean, sugar‑like sweetness.

## Who should avoid Sucralose?
Most people can use sucralose within the ADI. If you prefer to avoid high‑intensity sweeteners, are following specific medical advice, or notice personal sensitivity (such as taste aversion or digestive upset), choose products without sucralose and consider alternatives listed above. For children, pregnant or breastfeeding people, and those with medical conditions, ask a healthcare professional if you have questions about regular use.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sucralose is just sugar.” Fact: It’s a different molecule derived from sugar; three hydroxyl groups are replaced by chlorine atoms, which changes how the body handles it.[^4]
- Myth: “It isn’t approved by major regulators.” Fact: It is allowed in the U.S. under 21 CFR 172.831 and authorized in the EU as E955.[^3][^5]
- Myth: “It always appears alone.” Fact: Many products blend sucralose with other sweeteners, such as [acesulfame K](/e950-acesulfame-k) or [aspartame](/e951-aspartame), to fine‑tune taste.

## Sucralose in branded foods
You’ll commonly see sucralose in:
- Zero‑sugar soft drinks and flavored waters
- “Light” yogurts and puddings
- Sugar‑free chewing gums and mints
- Protein shakes, ready‑to‑drink coffees, and flavored syrups
- Tabletop sweeteners (for example, sucralose‑based packets and spoonable blends)

Check the ingredient list for “sucralose” or the additive code “E955.”
