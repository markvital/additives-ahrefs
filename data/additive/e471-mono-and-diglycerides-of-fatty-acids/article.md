Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471) are common emulsifiers that help oil and water mix, keeping foods smooth and stable. They are made from glycerol and fatty acids that come from edible oils or animal fats. Regulators in the U.S. and EU consider them safe when used as intended.

## At a glance
- What it is: A mix of mono- and diglycerides made from glycerol and fatty acids; used mainly as an emulsifier and stabiliser.
- What it does: Keeps sauces, spreads, and desserts from separating; improves softness in baked goods; helps aeration and creaminess.
- Where it’s found: Breads and buns, cakes, margarine and spreads, coffee creamers, ice creams, non‑dairy milks, confectionery.
- Also called: E471, mono- and diglycerides, glyceryl monostearate, monostearin, monoolein.
- Dietary note: Can be made from plant oils or animal fats; check with the maker if you need a vegan or religiously compliant source.
- Safety: Approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

## Why is E471 — Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids — added to food?
Food makers use E471 to blend ingredients that do not normally mix, like oil and water. It works as an emulsifier and stabiliser, and it can also help strengthen doughs and improve texture when used at good manufacturing practice (GMP) levels.[^1]

## What foods contain E471?
You’ll often see E471 in packaged breads and rolls, cakes, margarines and spreads, whipped toppings, coffee creamers, plant-based milks, ice creams, and some confectionery. These uses are typical of the broad range of food categories reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the EU’s scientific body for food safety.[^3]

## What can replace E471?
Depending on the recipe, formulators may switch to:
- [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) from egg or soy
- [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for chocolate and spreads
- [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) or [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate) in bakery
- Acid esters of mono- and diglycerides such as [acetic](/e472a-acetic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lactic](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [tartaric](/e472d-tartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [diacetyl tartaric](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [citric](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), or [succinylated monoglycerides](/e472g-succinylated-monoglycerides)
- [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids) or [propylene glycol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Hydrocolloids for thickening/stabilising, like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)

## How is E471 made?
E471 is produced by reacting [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) with edible fats and oils (glycerolysis) and/or by esterifying glycerol with food‑grade fatty acids. The source fats may be of plant or animal origin, and the EU specification describes these manufacturing routes and sources.[^2]

## Is E471 safe to eat?
- United States: The FDA lists mono- and diglycerides as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) when used in line with GMP, and notes their roles as emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners, and texturizers.[^1]
- European Union: EFSA’s 2017 re‑evaluation concluded there is no safety concern for E471 at reported uses and levels.[^3]
- International: The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assigned an acceptable daily intake (ADI) “not specified,” indicating low toxicological concern at normal use levels.[^4]

## Does E471 have any benefits?
In foods, E471 helps keep emulsions stable, gives fine and even crumb structure in baked goods, supports aeration in whipped products, and improves creaminess in frozen desserts. These functions allow for consistent texture and shelf stability while using less total fat in some recipes.

## Who should avoid E471?
- Vegans, vegetarians, and people following certain religious diets may wish to verify the source, since E471 can be made from plant oils or animal fats.[^2]
- If you have ingredient‑source concerns (for example, avoiding certain oils), check the label or contact the manufacturer for details.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E471 is the same as trans fat.”  
  Fact: E471 is an emulsifier. It is not a trans fat, though it is made from fats or oils.
- Myth: “It isn’t digested.”  
  Fact: Mono- and diglycerides are broken down by normal fat‑digesting enzymes into glycerol and fatty acids, similar to other dietary fats.
- Myth: “It’s always plant‑based.”  
  Fact: It can come from plant or animal sources; the label usually does not state which.

## E471 in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “mono- and diglycerides,” “mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids,” “E471,” or names like “glyceryl monostearate.” Many mainstream breads, buns, cakes, spreads, coffee creamers, and ice creams use it for texture and stability. If you need a specific source (vegan or certified), check the brand’s website or contact their customer service.
