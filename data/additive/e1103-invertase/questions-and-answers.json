      "q": "what does invertase do",
      "a": "It splits sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose, creating invert sugar that helps confectionery stay soft, retain moisture, and resist crystallization.",

      "q": "what is invertase enzyme",
      "a": "Invertase (E1103) is the enzyme beta-fructofuranosidase, typically produced from yeast, that catalyzes the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose for use in foods.",

    {
      "q": "is invertase bad for you",
      "a": "No—it's considered safe at typical food levels (approved in the EU and GRAS in the U.S.). It’s digested like other proteins; enzyme sensitivities are rare.",

      "q": "where is invertase found",
      "a": "It occurs in yeast, plants, and bees (contributing to honey production), and food-grade invertase is usually produced from yeast for use in confectionery.",
