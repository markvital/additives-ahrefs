Gamma-tocopherol (E308) is a member of the vitamin E family used as an antioxidant in foods. It helps keep oils and other fat-rich foods from going rancid, protecting flavor, color, and nutrients.

## At a glance
- What it is: A vitamin E compound used as an antioxidant to slow fat oxidation.
- Also called: E308, gamma-tocopherol; often part of “mixed tocopherols.”
- Typical foods: Vegetable oils, spreads, salad dressings, snacks, bakery items, and flavorings.
- Label names: “E308,” “gamma-tocopherol,” or “mixed tocopherols (to protect freshness).”
- Source: Usually derived from vegetable oils (such as soy or corn); typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans.
- Main job: Helps prevent rancidity and off-flavors in fats and oils.

## Why is Gamme-tocopherol added to food?
Manufacturers add E308 because it is an effective antioxidant that slows the oxidation of fats and oils. In practical terms, that means it helps keep foods fresher for longer by protecting taste and aroma. In the U.S., tocopherols are recognized as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for use as antioxidants in foods.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also evaluated tocopherols (E306–E309) and concluded they are safe for their intended uses as food additives.[^2]

## What foods contain Gamme-tocopherol?
You are most likely to find E308 in foods that are high in fat, where oxidation is a concern:
- Bottled vegetable oils and cooking sprays
- Margarines and other fat-based spreads
- Salad dressings, mayonnaise, and sauces
- Roasted nuts, nut butters, and fried or baked snacks
- Bakery mixes and fat-based fillings
- Flavorings and food supplements

It can also appear on labels as “mixed tocopherols,” which often contain gamma- along with alpha- and delta-tocopherol. Gamma-tocopherol occurs naturally at higher levels in some edible oils such as soybean and corn oil.[^4]

## What can replace Gamme-tocopherol?
Depending on the food and process, formulators might choose:
- Other tocopherols: [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), [delta-tocopherol](/e309-delta-tocopherol), or [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract)
- Oil-soluble synthetic antioxidants: [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene), or [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq)
- Natural options: [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Synergists that help antioxidants work better in some foods: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) and [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

## How is Gamme-tocopherol made?
Food-grade gamma-tocopherol is typically obtained from vegetable oil by-products (such as deodorizer distillates) using distillation and purification to isolate specific tocopherols. European Union specifications describe gamma-tocopherol as derived from vegetable oils and set identity and purity criteria for its use as E308.[^3]

## Is Gamme-tocopherol safe to eat?
Yes, at approved use levels. In the U.S., tocopherols are GRAS when used as antioxidants in foods in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In Europe, EFSA re-evaluated tocopherols (E306–E309) and found no safety concern for their intended uses as food additives based on exposure estimates.[^2]

## Does Gamme-tocopherol have any benefits?
As a food additive, its main benefit is technological: it protects fats from oxidation, helping maintain quality and shelf life. In nutrition, gamma-tocopherol is one of several vitamin E compounds; alpha-tocopherol is the primary form maintained in human blood, while gamma is more abundant in certain oils and in some diets.[^4] Any vitamin-type benefit depends on overall diet, not the small amounts used to stabilize foods.

## Who should avoid Gamme-tocopherol?
- People taking blood thinners or with bleeding disorders should be mindful of high-dose vitamin E supplements, which can increase bleeding risk; amounts used as antioxidants in foods are much lower, but discuss questions with a healthcare professional.[^4]
- Individuals with specific dietary restrictions can note that E308 is generally sourced from vegetable oils and is typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans. If you avoid soy-derived ingredients, be aware that many commercial tocopherols are sourced from soy, though the final additive contains negligible protein.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E308 is an artificial dye.” Fact: It is a vitamin E compound used as an antioxidant, not a color.
- Myth: “Tocopherols always add a vitamin claim.” Fact: In additives, amounts are chosen to protect food, not to deliver a nutrient dose.
- Myth: “If a product has mixed tocopherols, it must contain synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Mixed tocopherols are commonly distilled from vegetable oils.

## Gamme-tocopherol in branded foods
On ingredient lists, E308 often appears as “gamma-tocopherol,” “E308,” or “mixed tocopherols (to protect freshness).” You’ll commonly see it on bottles of vegetable oil, in nut butters and roasted nuts, on snack foods that contain added oil, and in shelf-stable dressings and spreads.
