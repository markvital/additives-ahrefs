      "q": "why is hexamine banned",
      "a": "Some jurisdictions ban or strictly limit E239 in foods because it can decompose to formaldehyde in acidic conditions, raising safety concerns; where allowed, it’s typically only in certain cheeses with very low residual formaldehyde limits.",

    {
      "q": "how can hexamine damage the body",
      "a": "In acidic environments it can release formaldehyde, which can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract, and high exposure may cause gastrointestinal or urinary tract irritation. Approved food uses set low residual limits to minimize these risks.",
