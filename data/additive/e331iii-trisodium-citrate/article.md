Trisodium citrate (E331iii) is the trisodium salt of citric acid. It controls acidity, stabilizes flavor, and helps certain foods—especially processed cheese—melt smoothly and evenly.

## At a glance
- What it is: The trisodium salt of citric acid; a white, water‑soluble powder often listed as “sodium citrate” or “E331.”
- What it does: Acidity regulator and buffer (keeps pH steady), metal‑ion binder (sequestrant), and cheese‑melt “emulsifying salt.”
- Where it shows up: Soft drinks and sports drinks, flavored waters, processed cheese, jams and jellies, canned foods, and some frozen desserts.
- Diet notes: Adds sodium to the diet; typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets and is gluten‑free.

## Why is Trisodium citrate added to food?
Manufacturers use trisodium citrate because it regulates acidity and buffers pH, which keeps taste and texture stable during processing and shelf life.[^1] It also binds trace metals (as a “sequestrant”), which helps protect color and flavor in foods and drinks.[^1] In processed cheese, it acts as an “emulsifying salt” that promotes smooth melting and a uniform sliceable texture.[^2]

## What foods contain Trisodium citrate?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Beverages such as soft drinks, sports drinks, and flavored waters where it adjusts tartness and stabilizes pH.[^1]
- Processed cheese and cheese products, where it is one of the permitted emulsifying salts that create a smooth melt and consistent texture.[^2]
- Jams, jellies, preserves, canned fruits and vegetables, and some frozen desserts, where it helps control acidity and stability.

On ingredient lists it may appear as “sodium citrate,” “trisodium citrate,” or “E331.”

## What can replace Trisodium citrate?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- To adjust tartness or pH: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), or [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid).
- To buffer acidity with a similar taste profile: [monosodium citrate](/e331i-monosodium-citrate) or [disodium citrate](/e331ii-disodium-citrate); for low‑sodium formulations, consider [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates).
- To improve melt or emulsification in processed cheese: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) are common alternatives in that specific use.

## How is Trisodium citrate made?
Food‑grade trisodium citrate is produced by neutralizing citric acid with a sodium base (typically sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate), followed by crystallization and drying to achieve the required purity and particle size.[^3] These identity and purity criteria are set in European Union specifications for food additives.

## Is Trisodium citrate safe to eat?
Food safety bodies have reviewed citric acid and its salts (E330–E333), including trisodium citrate, and found no safety concern at the reported use levels in foods.[^4] In everyday amounts used in foods and beverages, it is broadly considered safe for the general population.

## Does Trisodium citrate have any benefits?
- It gives beverages a stable, rounded tartness by buffering acidity, which helps flavors stay consistent over shelf life.
- In cheese processing, it promotes a smooth, uniform melt and prevents fat and water from separating.
- By binding trace metals, it can help protect flavor and color in products that are sensitive to oxidation.

These are technological benefits to the food; they are not health claims.

## Who should avoid Trisodium citrate?
- People on sodium‑restricted diets (for example, for high blood pressure or certain kidney conditions) should account for all sources of sodium, including sodium salts like sodium citrate, and follow their healthcare provider’s advice.[^5]
- If your clinician has advised you to limit certain electrolytes, check labels and choose low‑ or no‑sodium alternatives when possible.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium citrate makes foods taste salty.” Fact: It is a sodium salt, but it’s usually used at low levels for acidity control, not for salty flavor.
- Myth: “It’s just citric acid.” Fact: It’s related to citric acid but is a different substance—a buffered salt that behaves differently in recipes.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: Its main roles are acidity regulation, buffering, metal‑ion binding, and emulsification; any preservative effect is indirect and recipe‑dependent.
- Myth: “It must come from citrus fruit.” Fact: Food‑grade material is made by neutralizing purified citric acid, regardless of where that citric acid originated.

## Trisodium citrate in branded foods
On U.S. labels, look for “sodium citrate” or “trisodium citrate.” In the EU, it may appear as “E331” (often with “iii” for the trisodium form). You’ll commonly see it on beverages, processed cheese slices and spreads, shelf‑stable sauces, and some canned or jarred fruits. If you’re tracking sodium intake, check the Nutrition Facts panel and ingredient list together.
