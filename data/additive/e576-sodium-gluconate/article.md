Sodium gluconate (E576) is the sodium salt of gluconic acid. In food, it mainly works as a sequestrant, which means it binds trace metals that can cause off-flavors, discoloration, or texture changes. It is widely authorized in many countries and used in small amounts across different foods.

## At a glance
- Role: sequestrant and stabiliser that binds trace metals and helps keep foods clear, stable, and tasting as intended.
- Where you’ll see it: beverages (especially those with added minerals), sauces, canned vegetables and legumes, processed cheese and cheese spreads, and some baked goods.
- Label names: “Sodium gluconate” or “E576.”
- Diet notes: contributes a small amount of sodium; typically made by fermenting plant sugars, so it’s generally suitable for vegetarians and vegans.

## Why is sodium gluconate added to food?
Manufacturers add sodium gluconate to control the effects of metal ions like iron and copper. These metals can speed up oxidation, dull colors, create haze in drinks, and even add a metallic or bitter note. By binding these ions, sodium gluconate helps protect flavor, color, and clarity. It is authorized in the European Union as a food additive (E576) in the functional class of sequestrants and stabilisers when used according to the rules in the additive regulation.[^1]

A related benefit is gentle pH management. While sodium gluconate is not a strong acid, it can help buffer formulations alongside acids and salts such as [gluconic acid](/e574-gluconic-acid) and [glucono delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone).

## What foods contain sodium gluconate?
You’re most likely to find sodium gluconate in:
- Clear beverages and flavored waters, especially those fortified with minerals
- Canned beans, vegetables, and pickles
- Dressings, sauces, and condiments
- Processed cheese and cheese spreads
- Some baked goods and dessert mixes

In these foods, it helps keep flavors clean, colors bright, and textures consistent during shelf life and after opening.

## What can replace sodium gluconate?
Alternatives depend on the job it’s doing:
- For binding metals: [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate) is a strong chelator used at very low levels.
- For mild buffering and metal control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) and [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) are common.
- For stabilising proteins and texture: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) may help in dairy and meat systems.
- For antioxidant support: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) can slow oxidation, often used together with a sequestrant.

The choice depends on taste impact, label goals, and how strong the chelating effect needs to be.

## How is sodium gluconate made?
Sodium gluconate is the sodium salt of gluconic acid (chemical formula C6H11O7Na).[^4] Gluconic acid is typically produced by fermenting glucose with safe food microorganisms; the acid may also be obtained via its naturally forming lactone, glucono-δ-lactone.[^3] Neutralising gluconic acid with a food-grade alkali (such as sodium hydroxide) yields sodium gluconate, which must meet purity and identity specifications set in EU law for food additives.[^2]

## Is sodium gluconate safe to eat?
Within the European Union, sodium gluconate (E576) is authorised as a food additive and may be used only in foods and at levels permitted by law.[^1] Its identity and purity are defined in the EU specifications for food additives, which also include tests for contaminants.[^2] When used as intended in foods, sodium gluconate contributes only small amounts of sodium compared with table salt. People who must limit sodium should still count all sources of sodium in their diet.

## Does sodium gluconate have any benefits?
- Helps keep drinks clear by reducing haze from metal ions.
- Protects flavor by slowing metal-driven oxidation that can cause “metallic” or stale notes.
- Supports color and texture stability in canned vegetables, sauces, and cheese products.

These are formulation benefits—consumers may notice them as fresher flavor, brighter color, and a cleaner finish over the product’s shelf life.

## Who should avoid sodium gluconate?
- People on sodium-restricted diets should monitor total sodium intake, including from additives like sodium gluconate.
- Infants and young children should consume only age-appropriate foods. Always follow product instructions and professional dietary advice.

If you have a specific medical condition (such as kidney disease or severe hypertension), ask a healthcare professional about overall sodium management.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium gluconate is a preservative that kills germs.” Fact: Its main role is to bind metals; it is not a primary antimicrobial.
- Myth: “It’s a thick chemical salt of unknown origin.” Fact: It’s generally made by fermenting glucose and then neutralising the resulting gluconic acid.
- Myth: “It adds a lot of salt to food.” Fact: It contributes some sodium, but it’s used in small amounts for quality control, not for salty flavor.

## Sodium gluconate in branded foods
On labels, look for “Sodium gluconate” or “E576.” You’ll often see it on beverages with added minerals, canned vegetables, pickled products, sauces and dressings, and processed cheese. It’s usually one item among several stabilisers or acid regulators on the ingredient list.
