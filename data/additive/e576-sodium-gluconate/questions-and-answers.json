      "q": "is sodium gluconate safe",
      "a": "Yes—at permitted food-use levels it’s considered safe; EFSA found no safety concern for gluconic acid and its salts, though it does contribute sodium, which may matter on sodium-restricted diets.",

      "q": "what is sodium gluconate in soap",

      "q": "is sodium gluconate gluten free",
      "a": "Yes—sodium gluconate is inherently gluten-free; it’s made by fermenting glucose and contains no wheat proteins, though sensitive consumers should check for cross-contact claims from manufacturers.",

    {
      "q": "what is sodium gluconate used for",
      "a": "In foods it functions mainly as a sequestrant/stabiliser (and sometimes thickener) to bind metal ions and improve stability and texture; it’s also widely used industrially as a chelating agent in cleaning, water treatment, and concrete admixtures.",
