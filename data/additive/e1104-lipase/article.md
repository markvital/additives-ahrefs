Lipase (E1104) is an enzyme that breaks down fats into smaller parts. Food makers use it mainly as a processing aid to shape flavor, texture, and handling in products like cheese, baked goods, and edible oils. Most lipase used today is made by fermentation with safe food-grade microbes.

## At a glance
- What it is: An enzyme that splits fats (oils and triglycerides) into fatty acids and glycerol
- What it does: Helps develop savory cheese notes, improves dough handling, and tailors fats and oils
- Where it’s found: Cheese and enzyme‑modified cheese, breads and crackers, some processed oils and flavors
- Typical source: Produced by fermentation with selected fungi or other microorganisms
- Dietary notes: Can be microbial or animal‑derived; check with the maker if vegetarian, vegan, halal, or kosher status matters
- Labeling: May appear as “lipase” or “enzymes,” and sometimes functions only as a processing aid

## Why is lipase added to food?
Lipase targets triglycerides (the main form of fat) and releases flavorful fatty acids. In cheese making, this creates sharp, piquant notes and is also used to make enzyme‑modified cheese, a concentrated flavor ingredient defined in U.S. standards of identity.[^2]

In baking, lipase can improve dough handling and bread volume by changing lipids naturally present in flour and added fats. In edible oils, specialized lipases are used to rearrange fatty acids (interesterification) to achieve desired melting or nutritional profiles.

## What foods contain lipase?
- Cheese flavors: Enzyme‑modified cheese (EMC) uses lipase to generate strong cheese flavors for snacks, sauces, and processed cheeses.[^2]
- Bakery items: Breads, buns, tortillas, and crackers may use lipase as a processing aid to strengthen dough and improve crumb.
- Fats and oils: Some table spreads and shortenings use lipase in manufacturing to tailor texture and melting behavior.[^3]
- Savory flavors: Lipase can help release characteristic notes in dairy‑type or meat‑type flavors.[^3]

Because lipase often acts as a processing aid, little to none remains active in the final food, especially after baking or cooking.

## What can replace lipase?
- For dough strengthening and volume: Emulsifiers like [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) can offer some similar handling benefits.
- For bakery enzyme toolkits: Other enzymes such as [glucose oxidase](/e1102-glucose-oxidase) or [protease](/e1101-protease) are sometimes used to fine‑tune dough properties.
- For cheese flavor: Longer aging, different cultures, or animal‑derived lipase can shift flavor profiles, though results differ.

## How is lipase made?
Commercial lipase is typically produced by fermenting selected microorganisms, followed by filtration and purification to remove the production organisms and by‑products.[^3] The purified enzyme may be stabilized with food‑grade carriers and, for some fat‑processing applications, it can be immobilized on a solid support so it can be reused and kept out of the final oil.[^3]

## Is lipase safe to eat?
In the European Union, food enzymes must meet Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008, which requires safety evaluation and authorization before use.[^1] EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, performs these evaluations and publishes opinions on specific enzyme preparations.[^5] In the United States, many specific lipase preparations have been reviewed through the FDA’s Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notice process.[^4]

Lipase is a protein, so it is usually inactivated by heat during baking or cooking, and any small amounts present are digested like other dietary proteins. Safety always depends on the specific source organism, manufacturing process, and intended use, which is why regulators evaluate enzyme preparations case by case.[^1]

## Does lipase have any benefits?
- Flavor: Produces characteristic sharp, savory notes in certain cheeses and cheese flavors.
- Texture and handling: Can improve dough strength, gas retention, and crumb structure in bread.
- Process efficiency: Helps tailor fats and oils with fewer harsh processing conditions than some chemical methods.

## Who should avoid lipase?
- People with enzyme sensitivities: Rarely, individuals sensitive to specific enzymes may prefer to avoid them.
- Occupational exposure: Bakers and workers handling enzyme powders should follow good controls; inhaling enzyme dusts can cause allergic sensitization.[^6]
- Dietary or religious preferences: If the source matters (microbial vs. animal), check with the manufacturer or look for suitable certification.

## Myths & facts
- “Lipase is a preservative.” Fact: It is not a preservative; it is a processing enzyme that modifies fats.
- “Lipase always stays active in food.” Fact: Cooking and baking usually inactivate enzymes.
- “All lipase is animal‑derived.” Fact: Most food‑grade lipase today is produced by fermentation with microorganisms.
- “Lipase changes the nutrition of foods.” Fact: It mainly affects texture and flavor; any nutritional changes depend on how fats are modified.

## lipase in branded foods
You may see lipase listed as “lipase,” “triacylglycerol lipase,” or simply “enzymes.” It most often appears in:
- Breads, rolls, tortillas, and crackers
- Cheese, enzyme‑modified cheese, and cheese‑flavored snacks
- Spreads, shortenings, and some edible oils
- Savory flavor concentrates and seasonings

If the ingredient list only shows “enzymes,” the specific type may not be disclosed. Brands sometimes provide details on request, especially for dietary certifications.
