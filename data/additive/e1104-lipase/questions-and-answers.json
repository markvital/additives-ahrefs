      "q": "what is lipase in blood test",
      "a": "Lipase is a fat‑digesting enzyme; the blood test measures your own pancreatic lipase to assess pancreatic inflammation or injury (e.g., acute pancreatitis), not the food additive E1104.",

      "q": "what is high lipase milk",
      "a": "It refers to expressed breast milk that develops a soapy or rancid smell/taste because natural lipase breaks down milk fats during storage; it’s generally safe but some babies may refuse it.",

    {
      "q": "what does lipase test for",
      "a": "It’s mainly used to detect or monitor acute pancreatitis and other pancreatic disorders, where elevated pancreatic lipase in blood suggests inflammation or duct obstruction.",

    {
      "q": "how to prevent high lipase in breastmilk",
      "a": "You can’t change natural levels, but scalding freshly expressed milk (about 60–62°C/140–144°F for a few minutes, then cool quickly) inactivates lipase and prevents off‑flavors; prompt chilling/freezing and clean handling also help.",

    {
      "q": "what causes high lipase milk",
      "a": "Normal variation in a mother’s milk lipase and storage factors (time and temperature) can increase fat breakdown, leading to a soapy/rancid taste; this is due to natural milk enzymes, not added E1104.",
