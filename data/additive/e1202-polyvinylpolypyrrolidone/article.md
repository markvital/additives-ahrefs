Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (E1202), also called crospovidone, is a cross‑linked, insoluble polymer used to clarify and stabilize drinks like beer and wine. It works by binding haze‑forming polyphenols such as tannins, and is removed by filtration so it does not stay in the finished beverage.

## At a glance
- Also known as E1202, crospovidone, or cross‑linked polyvidone
- Function: stabiliser and clarifying aid, especially in beverages
- Insoluble polymer that binds [tannin](/e181-tannin) and other polyphenols
- Used during processing and then filtered out
- Evaluated by regulators; no safety concern at approved uses

## Why is Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone added to food?
Producers use E1202 to prevent cloudiness and haze in beverages. The polymer grabs onto polyphenols (like [tannin](/e181-tannin)) that can cause haze, bitterness, or browning, and then the solids are removed by filtration, leaving the drink clearer and more stable over time.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone?
You’ll mainly see E1202 used in:
- Beer and other malt beverages
- Wine and wine must
- Some fruit juices and similar drinks
- Occasionally vinegar

In the United States, it is approved as a processing aid for clarifying beverages, and it is filtered out before packaging.[^1] In the European Union, it is an authorized food additive with specifications set in EU law.[^4]

## What can replace Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone?
Depending on the drink and the problem to solve, technologists may use:
- [Bentonite](/e558-bentonite) (a type of clay) to remove proteins
- [Gelatine](/e428-gelatine) or other protein finings for tannin reduction
- [Silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) as a fining/clarifying aid
- Process choices (longer cold conditioning, filtration tweaks)

Each method has trade‑offs for flavor, clarity, and whether the product remains vegan or allergen‑free. Brewers and winemakers often trial blends to reach a target haze or flavor outcome.[^2]

## How is Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone made?
E1202 is made by polymerizing N‑vinyl‑2‑pyrrolidone and cross‑linking the chains to form an insoluble, porous network. The result is a white, granular powder that swells in water but does not dissolve—ideal for binding phenolic compounds and then being removed by filtration. The EU sets identity and purity specifications for this material, including limits for residual monomers and other impurities.[^4]

## Is Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed E1202 and consider it safe for its intended uses in food and drink processing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows its use as a clarifying agent provided it is removed by filtration from the finished beverage.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern for E1202 at the reported uses and exposure levels; the polymer is not absorbed and is excreted unchanged.[^3]

## Does Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone have any benefits?
- Improves clarity and visual appeal by reducing haze
- Helps stabilize flavor by removing excess polyphenols that can cause bitterness or astringency
- Can extend shelf stability by reducing haze‑forming reactions over time

Wine and beer makers use E1202 for these technological benefits, often achieving a more consistent product without leaving the polymer in the final drink.[^2][^1]

## Who should avoid Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone?
- People who prefer minimally processed beverages may choose products labeled “unfined” or “unfiltered.”
- Individuals with a known sensitivity to povidone‑type materials in medications should consult a healthcare professional about suitability. This is uncommon, and E1202 used in beverages is filtered out, but personal medical advice takes priority.

In the U.S., processing aids that are removed during manufacture are generally exempt from ingredient labeling, so you may not see E1202 listed on the label even when it was used.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- “It stays in my drink.” In regulated uses, E1202 is added during processing and then removed by filtration; it is not intended to remain in the finished beverage.[^1]
- “It’s the same as PVP.” Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (E1202) is an insoluble, cross‑linked version of [polyvinylpyrrolidone](/e1201-polyvinylpyrrolidone) (E1201), which is water‑soluble. They have different roles and specifications in food law.[^4][^3]
- “It’s unsafe plastic.” EFSA reviewed E1202 and found no safety concern at the reported uses and exposures; it is not absorbed by the gut and is excreted unchanged.[^3]

## Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone in branded foods
You’re most likely to encounter E1202 use in filtered beers and clarified wines. Some fruit juices and vinegars may also be treated. Because it is a processing aid that is filtered out, many labels will not list it. In the EU, you may see “E1202” on ingredient lists when declared; in the U.S., look for notes like “cold‑stabilized” or “clarified,” and check with the producer if you want to know whether E1202 was used.[^5]
