Xanthan gum (E415) is a common food additive that thickens and stabilizes foods and drinks. It is made by fermenting simple sugars with a friendly bacterium and is used in tiny amounts to improve texture and consistency. Regulators in the United States and the European Union consider it safe when used as intended.

## At a glance
- Role: thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier that keeps sauces smooth and particles suspended
- Made by fermentation of sugars with the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, then dried and milled
- Widely used across many food categories; approved by major regulators
- Safety: generally well tolerated, though large amounts can cause gas or soft stools; not for premature infants per FDA advice

## Why is Xanthan gum added to food?
Xanthan gum helps foods hold together and feel thicker, smoother, and more stable. Regulators recognize it as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier for direct addition to foods, meaning it can improve texture, keep emulsions from separating, and help suspend spices or cocoa in liquids.[^1]

## What foods contain Xanthan gum?
Xanthan gum is authorized for use across a wide range of food categories internationally. The Codex General Standard for Food Additives (an international food standards program from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization) lists E415 for uses such as sauces and dressings, bakery products, beverages, dairy products and analogues, and foods for special dietary uses.[^2]

You can often spot “xanthan gum” or “E415” on ingredient lists for salad dressings, condiments, non-dairy drinks, frozen desserts, and many ready-to-eat or heat-and-eat foods.

## What can replace Xanthan gum?
Depending on the recipe and the texture you want, cooks and manufacturers may swap in:
- [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive} for cold-thickened sauces and beverages
- [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive} for creamy, elastic textures
- [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive} for gels and fluid gels that hold particles in suspension
- [agar](/e406-agar){.additive} or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive} for gels and dairy-like textures
- [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive} for fruit fillings and jams
- [sodium carboxy methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose){.additive} for stable, smooth viscosity

## How is Xanthan gum made?
Xanthan gum is produced by fermenting a carbohydrate (such as glucose, sucrose, or lactose) with a pure culture of the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. After fermentation, the gum is recovered from the broth—commonly by precipitating it with isopropyl alcohol—then it is washed, dried, and milled into a fine powder for use in foods.[^1]

## Is Xanthan gum safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended. In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated xanthan gum (E415) and concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels and that setting a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not necessary. Mild gastrointestinal effects like gas or soft stools can occur at high intakes, which is common for many fermentable gums.[^3]

## Does Xanthan gum have any benefits?
For makers and home cooks, xanthan gum offers reliable, smooth thickness at very low doses, resists separating over time, and works across a wide range of temperatures and pH. It helps sauces cling, keeps cocoa from settling in chocolate milk, and improves the body of many low‑fat or reduced‑sugar foods.

## Who should avoid Xanthan gum?
- Premature infants: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised against feeding a xanthan gum–based thickening product (SimplyThick) to premature infants after reports of necrotizing enterocolitis (a serious intestinal condition). Caregivers should follow medical advice for thickening infant feeds.[^4]
- People with sensitive digestion: Like many fiber‑like gums, large amounts can cause bloating or soft stools. Those with sensitive guts may want to start with small amounts and see how they feel.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Xanthan gum is synthetic or “petroleum‑based.” Fact: It is made by microbial fermentation of sugars, then purified and dried.
- Myth: It’s only for industrial foods. Fact: It is common in home cooking and baking to stabilize dressings, smoothies, and sauces.
- Myth: It’s unsafe. Fact: Major regulators have reviewed xanthan gum and consider it safe at permitted use levels, with only mild digestive effects at high intakes.

## Xanthan gum in branded foods
On ingredient labels, look for “xanthan gum” or “E415.” You’ll find it in many familiar products, from salad dressings and barbecue sauces to plant‑based beverages, frozen desserts, and heat‑and‑eat meals. It is usually present in small amounts—often near the end of the ingredient list—because a little goes a long way.
