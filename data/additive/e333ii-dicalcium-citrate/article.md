Dicalcium citrate (E333ii) is a calcium salt of citric acid used to control acidity, bind metal ions, and keep foods stable. It has a mild taste, works well in drinks and dairy, and can also add a small amount of calcium.

## At a glance
- What it is: The dicalcium salt of [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid); one of the three “calcium citrates” grouped under E333 (i = monocalcium, ii = dicalcium, iii = tricalcium).
- What it does: Works mainly as a sequestrant (binds metal ions that could cause haze or off-flavors) and stabiliser; also helps regulate acidity.
- Where it’s used: Common in beverages, jams and jellies, dairy and plant-based drinks, and some baked goods.
- Taste and solubility: Nearly neutral in flavor; moderate solubility that helps in clear beverages and dairy-style products.
- Labels you might see: “Dicalcium citrate,” “calcium citrate,” “E333” or “E333(ii).”
- Dietary notes: Contributes calcium but in small amounts at typical additive levels.

## Why is Dicalcium citrate added to food?
Manufacturers use dicalcium citrate to keep products stable and clear. As a sequestrant, it ties up trace metals like iron and copper that can cause haze, discoloration, or flavor changes. As a stabiliser and acidity regulator, it helps control pH and texture in drinks, jams, and dairy-style foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Dicalcium citrate?
You’ll most often find it in nonalcoholic beverages, fruit preparations (like jams and jellies), dairy and dairy analogues, and some baked goods and desserts. These are typical categories where calcium citrates (INS 333) are permitted internationally and used for stability, clarity, and pH control.[^2]

## What can replace Dicalcium citrate?
Depending on the job it’s doing, common stand‑ins include:
- For tartness or pH control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates).
- For binding metals (sequestration): [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates) or other approved chelators (choices depend on the recipe).
- For calcium fortification: [calcium lactate](/e327-calcium-lactate) or [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates), chosen per taste and solubility needs.
- For buffering in baked goods: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) alongside suitable acid sources.

## How is Dicalcium citrate made?
Food‑grade dicalcium citrate is typically produced by neutralising purified [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with a calcium source (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate), then filtering, washing, and drying the resulting crystals to meet purity specifications for E333(ii).[^3]

## Is Dicalcium citrate safe to eat?
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated citric acid (E330) and its citrate salts (including E333) and found no safety concern at reported uses and use levels in foods.[^1] In the United States, calcium citrate is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[^4]

## Does Dicalcium citrate have any benefits?
Yes—beyond its technical roles, it supplies bioavailable calcium, which supports bones, teeth, and normal muscle and nerve function. Calcium citrate is a common supplemental form of calcium and can be useful where gentle taste and reasonable solubility are desired.[^5]

## Who should avoid Dicalcium citrate?
- People advised to limit calcium (for example, due to hypercalcemia or certain kidney conditions) should follow their healthcare provider’s guidance; excessive calcium from any source can be harmful.[^5]
- If you have a history of kidney stones, talk with a clinician before taking calcium supplements; supplement timing and dose can affect risk, and personal advice is important.[^6]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as citric acid, so it must taste very sour.” Fact: Dicalcium citrate is far less tart; it’s used mostly for stability and pH control, not for strong sourness.
- Myth: “It’s a preservative.” Fact: It doesn’t kill microbes; it mainly binds metals and stabilises formulations. Any shelf‑life effects are indirect.
- Myth: “Adding it automatically fixes low calcium intake.” Fact: At typical additive levels, it adds only small amounts of calcium; meaningful calcium fortification requires higher, planned levels.

## Dicalcium citrate in branded foods
You might see it listed as “dicalcium citrate,” “calcium citrate,” “E333,” or “E333(ii)” on ingredient labels. It appears in clear or cloudy soft drinks, fruit preparations (like jam), yogurts and plant-based dairy alternatives, and some baked goods where it helps with pH balance, clarity, and mineral control.
