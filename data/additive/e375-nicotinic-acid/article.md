Nicotinic acid (E375) is another name for niacin, a form of vitamin B3 used to fortify foods and support normal metabolism. It is commonly added to enriched flour, rice, and breakfast cereals to help prevent deficiencies. Most people get safe amounts from regular foods, while very high supplemental doses can cause flushing.

## At a glance
- What it is: Nicotinic acid, also called niacin, is vitamin B3.
- What it does in food: Nutrient fortifier in enriched and fortified foods.
- Common in: Enriched flour and rice, breakfast cereals, meal replacements, and energy drinks.
- Label names: Nicotinic acid, niacin, E375; the related form “niacinamide” or “nicotinamide” may also appear.
- Diets: Suitable for vegetarians and vegans; not derived from animal sources.
- Taste and texture: Neutral; does not affect flavor at typical use levels.

## Why is Nicotinic acid added to food?
Manufacturers add nicotinic acid to enrich foods with vitamin B3, a nutrient the body needs but cannot store in large amounts.[^1] In many staple foods, enrichment standards require niacin to be added back after processing, which helps prevent deficiency in the population.[^2] Niacin supports energy metabolism by forming the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which help convert food into usable energy.[^3]

## What foods contain Nicotinic acid?
You’ll most often find nicotinic acid in:
- Enriched wheat flour and products made from it (such as sandwich bread, pasta, and some crackers), because U.S. standards of identity for enriched flour include niacin.[^2]
- Enriched rice, which must include niacin under U.S. rules.[^2]
- Fortified breakfast cereals, meal replacement shakes, and some energy drinks, where niacin is added alongside other vitamins such as [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin) and [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid).[^3]

On ingredient lists, look for “niacin,” “nicotinic acid,” or “E375.”

## What can replace Nicotinic acid?
- Niacinamide (also called nicotinamide) is an alternative form of vitamin B3 often used in fortification; it is also affirmed as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) in the U.S.[^4] Niacinamide typically does not cause the skin flushing that some people experience with nicotinic acid.[^6]
- Foods naturally rich in niacin—like meats, fish, peanuts, and yeast—can also raise niacin intake, though this depends on the recipe and is not a direct “additive” replacement.

## How is Nicotinic acid made?
Food-grade nicotinic acid is produced by chemical synthesis and then purified and crystallized to meet quality standards for use as a nutrient in foods. Manufacturers choose between forms (nicotinic acid or niacinamide) based on the product type and desired nutrition profile.

## Is Nicotinic acid safe to eat?
When used as a nutrient supplement in foods at typical levels, nicotinic acid is affirmed as GRAS in the United States.[^1] Very high supplemental doses of nicotinic acid can cause flushing, itching, stomach upset, and, in rare cases, liver problems—effects that are not expected from normal dietary amounts.[^6]

## Does Nicotinic acid have any benefits?
Yes. Niacin is essential for health because it helps form the coenzymes NAD and NADP that support hundreds of reactions in energy metabolism.[^3] Severe deficiency leads to pellagra, a condition historically linked to low-nutrient diets; fortifying staples with niacin helped reduce this risk.[^3]

## Who should avoid Nicotinic acid?
People with liver disease, active stomach ulcers, or gout, and those taking certain medicines (such as some cholesterol-lowering drugs), should avoid high-dose nicotinic acid supplements unless a healthcare professional advises otherwise.[^6] Children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use high-dose niacin on their own; follow medical guidance for any supplementation.[^6]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Nicotinic acid is related to nicotine in tobacco. Fact: Despite the similar names, they are different substances with different effects.
- Myth: Flushing means you’re allergic. Fact: Niacin flush is a known effect of high nicotinic acid doses and is not an allergy.
- Myth: More niacin is always better. Fact: Normal fortified foods are safe, but very high supplemental doses can cause side effects.
- Myth: All forms of B3 act the same. Fact: Niacin (nicotinic acid) and niacinamide (nicotinamide) are both vitamin B3, but only nicotinic acid typically causes flushing.

## Nicotinic acid in branded foods
You may see E375 or “niacin” on labels of:
- Sliced sandwich bread and hamburger buns made with enriched flour
- Breakfast cereal flakes and loops
- Instant rice and other enriched rice products
- Meal replacement drinks and nutrition bars
- Some energy drinks and powdered drink mixes

Label wording varies by brand; check the ingredients for “niacin,” “nicotinic acid,” or “E375.”
