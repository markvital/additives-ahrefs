Alanin (alanine) is a natural amino acid that can be added to foods mainly for flavor—mellowing bitterness and rounding sweetness—while also contributing a small amount of protein. International bodies list alanine (often as DL‑alanine) as a permitted flavoring/flavor enhancer in a wide range of foods when used at typical levels. [^1][^2]

## At a glance
- What it is: Alanin (alanine) is one of the building blocks of proteins. [^1]
- Main role in foods: Flavoring/flavor enhancer with a mild, sweet taste; sometimes used to round out flavor profiles. [^2][^3]
- Status: Evaluated by international authorities for use as a flavoring agent; no safety concern at typical flavoring levels. [^3]
- Also known as: L‑alanine, DL‑alanine (mixture of two mirror‑image forms). [^1]

## Why is Alanin added to food?
Alanin is added because it tastes mildly sweet and can soften bitter, sour, or sharp notes, helping flavors seem smoother and more balanced. [^2][^3] As an amino acid, it can also contribute a small amount of nitrogen (protein) to a recipe, though at flavoring levels this nutritional contribution is minor. [^1]

## What foods contain Alanin?
You may find Alanin in flavored drinks, candies, baked goods, dairy desserts, and other processed foods where a gentle sweetness or flavor rounding is desired. [^2] On labels it may appear as “L‑alanine” or “DL‑alanine.” [^1]

## What can replace Alanin?
- Glycine ([E640](/e640-glycine-and-its-sodium-salt){.additive}) offers a clean, sweet taste and is often used for similar flavor‑rounding purposes.
- Monosodium glutamate ([E621](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}) enhances savory/umami notes rather than sweetness, but it can improve overall flavor balance in some recipes.
- High‑intensity sweeteners like [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive} or bulk sweeteners like [erythritol](/e968-erythritol){.additive} add sweetness; they do not mimic alanine’s full flavor‑rounding effect, but may be part of a reformulation.

## How is Alanin made?
Commercial Alanin is produced by methods commonly used for amino acids, including microbial fermentation and chemical synthesis, yielding a product identical to the alanine found in foods and the human body. [^1][^3]

## Is Alanin safe to eat?
International expert committees (JECFA, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) have evaluated alanine used as a flavoring and concluded there is no safety concern at current intake levels when used as intended. [^3] Codex Alimentarius (the international food standards body of FAO/WHO) lists DL‑alanine (INS 639) as a food additive with flavoring/flavor‑enhancing function in the General Standard for Food Additives. [^2]

Acronyms explained:
- JECFA: Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (United Nations bodies). [^3]
- FAO/WHO Codex (Codex Alimentarius): International food standards program of the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization. [^2]

## Does Alanin have any benefits?
- Taste: Helps smooth harsh notes and round sweetness in complex flavor systems. [^2][^3]
- Nutrition: As an amino acid, alanine is a building block of protein, but at the low amounts used for flavoring, the nutritional impact is small. [^1]

## Who should avoid Alanin?
Most people do not need to avoid alanine used as a flavoring. Individuals advised by their healthcare professional to follow a protein‑restricted diet (for example, some people with chronic kidney disease) may choose to keep an eye on total protein and amino acid intake from all sources. [^4]

## Myths & facts
- “Alanin is the same as MSG.” False. Alanine is a simple amino acid with mild sweetness; MSG ([E621](/e621-monosodium-glutamate){.additive}) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and enhances umami/savory taste. [^1]
- “Alanin is an artificial sweetener.” False. It is a naturally occurring amino acid; while slightly sweet, it is used for flavor rounding, not as a high‑intensity sweetener. [^1][^2]
- “Alanin adds a lot of protein.” Not at typical use levels. The amounts used for flavoring are small, so the protein contribution is minimal. [^1]

## Alanin in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “L‑alanine” or “DL‑alanine.” You’re most likely to see it in flavored beverages, confectionery, baked goods, and similar items where formulators fine‑tune taste balance. [^2]
