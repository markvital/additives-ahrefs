Tetrasodium diphosphate (E450iii) is a phosphate salt used to keep foods moist, stable, and evenly textured. It helps bind minerals, balance acidity, and support smooth mixing in products like processed meats and cheeses, seafood, and some baked or powdered foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: A white, water‑soluble sodium salt of diphosphate; also called tetrasodium pyrophosphate or TSPP.
- What it does: Works as a sequestrant (binds metal ions), emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, and humectant (helps retain moisture).
- Where you’ll find it: Processed meat and poultry, seafood products, processed cheeses, and some bakery and powdered mixes.
- On the label: “Tetrasodium diphosphate,” “tetrasodium pyrophosphate,” “sodium pyrophosphate,” “TSPP,” or “E450iii.”
- Diet notes: Mineral‑based and typically suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets; it adds phosphorus and sodium to foods.

## Why is Tetrasodium diphosphate added to food?
This additive does several jobs at once:
- As a sequestrant, it ties up trace metals like iron and copper that can cause off‑flavours, discoloration, or nutrient loss.
- As an emulsifier and stabiliser, it helps fat and water stay mixed and hold a smooth texture (for example, in processed cheese).
- As a humectant and thickener, it helps foods hold moisture and keep a consistent bite.
- It also helps control acidity (pH), which supports texture, colour, and microbial stability in many recipes.

## What foods contain Tetrasodium diphosphate?
- Meat and poultry products: It is allowed in many cured, cooked, or marinated items to improve water‑holding and texture, when used within limits and good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^3]
- Processed cheeses and cheese products: It serves as an emulsifying salt to keep cheese smooth and sliceable.[^4]
- Seafood, surimi, canned or formed products: Often used to help retain moisture and firmness.
- Some baked goods and dry mixes: It can support dough handling and help powders flow or dissolve evenly.
- It may appear alongside related phosphates such as [disodium diphosphate](/e450i-disodium-diphosphate){.additive}, [trisodium diphosphate](/e450ii-trisodium-diphosphate){.additive}, [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates){.additive}, or [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates){.additive}.

## What can replace Tetrasodium diphosphate?
Depending on the job it does in a recipe, possible stand‑ins include:
- For emulsifying/stabilising: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates){.additive}, [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates){.additive}, [sodium aluminum phosphate](/e541-sodium-aluminium-phosphate){.additive}, or non‑phosphate options like [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive} or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}.
- For pH control or buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [sodium citrate](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}.
- For leavening systems: Pairing acids with bases such as [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate){.additive} can be adjusted to replace phosphate‑based systems in some baked goods.
- For moisture retention: Other members of the [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates){.additive} family, or selected gums and proteins, may be used depending on the food.

## How is Tetrasodium diphosphate made?
Food‑grade tetrasodium diphosphate is produced from phosphate and sodium sources. A common route is to neutralise [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid){.additive} with sodium salts, then heat (calcine) the material to drive off water and form the pyrophosphate structure; the product is milled and screened to specification.[^2] The compound is a white, water‑soluble solid with the formula Na4P2O7.[^6]

## Is Tetrasodium diphosphate safe to eat?
- United States: Tetrasodium diphosphate is permitted for use in foods under federal regulations, and appears on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Additive Status List for appropriate uses and levels, subject to GMP.[^5] Its use in meat/poultry and processed cheese is specifically regulated.[^3][^4]
- European Union: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg per kg body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus, for all authorised phosphates (E 338–341, E 343, E 450–452).[^1] EFSA noted that some young consumers with high intakes could exceed this level, mainly from phosphate additives in processed foods.[^1]

## Does Tetrasodium diphosphate have any benefits?
In foods, it helps:
- Keep meats and seafood juicy and tender during cooking and storage.
- Maintain a smooth, uniform texture in processed cheeses.
- Protect flavour and colour by binding reactive metals that can cause quality losses.
- Improve the flow, mixing, and dissolution of powdered products.

These are technological (processing and quality) benefits rather than nutritional ones.

## Who should avoid Tetrasodium diphosphate?
- People who need to limit phosphorus, such as those with chronic kidney disease, may be advised to reduce phosphate additive intake. EFSA highlighted that individuals with moderate‑to‑severe kidney impairment could be more susceptible to high phosphate exposure.[^1]
- Those on sodium‑restricted diets may also wish to monitor intake, as this additive contributes sodium.
- Infants and young children who already consume many phosphate‑rich processed foods should avoid additional exposure where possible, to help stay within the ADI.[^1]

If you have a medical condition or special diet, ask a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalised advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Tetrasodium diphosphate is a bleach.” Fact: It is a phosphate salt used mainly to control texture, moisture, and pH; it is not a bleaching agent.
- Myth: “All phosphates are identical.” Fact: There are many phosphates (mono‑, di‑, tri‑ and polyphosphates). They behave differently and are regulated as a group but used for specific functions.
- Myth: “If it’s in food, it must add nutrition.” Fact: Its role is technological. It supports quality and safety but does not add meaningful nutrients.

## Tetrasodium diphosphate in branded foods
You can spot it on ingredient lists as “tetrasodium diphosphate,” “tetrasodium pyrophosphate,” “sodium pyrophosphate,” “TSPP,” or “E450iii.” It commonly appears in:
- Many brands of deli meats, hams, chicken nuggets, and similar items
- Processed cheese slices, spreads, and sauces
- Seafood products like surimi and some canned or formed items
- Dry mixes (puddings, drinks), and some bakery doughs

Ingredients can change, so always check the label.
