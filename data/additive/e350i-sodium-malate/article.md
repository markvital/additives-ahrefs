Sodium malate (E350i) is the sodium salt of malic acid, the organic acid that gives many fruits their tart taste. In food, it’s mainly used to control acidity and help products hold moisture, which can keep textures soft and flavors balanced. In the European Union, it’s an approved additive and is considered safe at permitted levels.

## At a glance
- Names you’ll see: “Sodium malate,” “E350i,” sometimes called the sodium salt of malic acid
- What it does: Controls acidity (pH), buffers sourness, and can help retain moisture
- Typical in: Drinks, fruit fillings, confections, jams, sauces, and baked goods
- Form and taste: White, slightly tart salt; contributes a clean, fruity sourness
- Diet note: Adds a small amount of sodium
- Related additives: [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)

## Why is Sodium malate added to food?
Sodium malate is used because it steadily controls acidity, helping foods and drinks keep a stable, pleasant tartness over shelf life. It acts as a buffer, meaning it resists sudden pH changes that could affect flavor, color, or texture.[^3]  
In some recipes, it also helps hold moisture (a humectant role), which can keep baked goods softer for longer and improve mouthfeel in confections. Its mild, fruity sourness pairs well with fruit flavors and balanced sweet-sour profiles.

## What foods contain Sodium malate?
You’ll most often find sodium malate in:
- Flavored drinks and sports beverages
- Fruit preparations, jams, and pie fillings
- Gummies, hard candies, and other confections
- Sauces, dressings, and marinades
- Baked goods and dessert mixes

Labeling may list it as “sodium malate,” “E350i,” or more broadly “sodium malates (E350)” depending on the product and market.

## What can replace Sodium malate?
Depending on the recipe and desired taste:
- For a sharper sour profile: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- For similar fruity tartness: [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) or [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate)
- For buffering with less sourness: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)  
Each substitute behaves a bit differently, so makers often run small tests to match flavor and pH.

## How is Sodium malate made?
Sodium malate is produced by neutralizing malic acid with a sodium base, typically sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate.[^1] The malic acid used is commonly made on an industrial scale by hydrating maleic anhydride or fumaric acid, then purified before conversion to the sodium salt.[^1]  
Both the L-form (from L-malic acid) and the DL-form (from racemic malic acid) are covered in EU specifications for sodium malates.[^1]

## Is Sodium malate safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated malic acid and its salts, including sodium malates, and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels.[^2] Sodium malates are authorized food additives in the EU under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^3]

## Does Sodium malate have any benefits?
For food quality, sodium malate:
- Stabilizes tartness and helps keep pH in the right range
- Can protect flavor and color by buffering against pH swings
- Helps retain moisture in some recipes, improving texture
- Provides a clean, fruity sourness that blends well with fruit flavors

These are technological benefits in the product; sodium malate itself is not used for health effects.

## Who should avoid Sodium malate?
- People on sodium-restricted diets may wish to limit foods that add up multiple sodium-containing ingredients.  
- Individuals who are sensitive to acidic foods (for example, with frequent heartburn) may prefer products with lower acidulant levels.  
If you have a medical condition requiring strict diet control, check labels and follow your healthcare professional’s advice.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Additives ending in ‘-ate’ are always harsh or salty.”  
  Fact: Sodium malate is mildly tart and is chosen for its clean, fruity acidity.

- Myth: “Sodium malate is synthetic and has nothing to do with real foods.”  
  Fact: It’s the salt of malic acid, an acid naturally found in many fruits such as apples.[^2]

- Myth: “All E-numbers are risky.”  
  Fact: E-numbers mean an additive was assessed and authorized in the EU with purity criteria and permitted uses.[^3]

## Sodium malate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sodium malate,” “E350i,” or sometimes the broader class “sodium malates (E350)”[.](#) In practice, it appears in flavored beverages, fruit-based fillings, candies, sauces, and some baked goods. If you’re comparing products, check both the ingredients and the nutrition facts to see how overall sodium fits your diet.
