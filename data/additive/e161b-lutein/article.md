Lutein (E161B) is a yellow to orange natural color from the carotenoid family, often extracted from marigold flowers. It gives foods warm golden shades and also occurs naturally in leafy greens and egg yolks.<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: a natural xanthophyll carotenoid used as a food color (yellow–orange)
- Where it comes from: typically extracted from Tagetes erecta (marigold) flowers
- Common uses: adds or restores color in drinks, baked goods, sauces, dairy-style products
- Regulatory status: authorized as a food color in both the U.S. and EU, within set conditions[^1][^2]

## Why is Lutein added to food?
Lutein adds or restores an appealing yellow to orange tone in foods, especially when natural color is lost during processing or storage. Because it is a carotenoid, it can deliver a warm, “sunny” hue that consumers associate with freshness and richness.

## What foods contain Lutein?
Manufacturers use lutein across a range of foods that benefit from yellow-to-orange color—such as beverages, bakery items, desserts, sauces, and fat-based spreads—subject to applicable rules in each market.[^2] Lutein also occurs naturally (not as an additive) in foods like spinach, kale, and egg yolks.[^4]

## What can replace Lutein?
Several other approved colors can create similar shades, depending on the product:
- Plant colors: [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}, [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive}, [beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene){.additive}, and [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene){.additive}
- Vitamins/colors: [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin){.additive}
- Related carotenoids: [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin){.additive}
- Inorganic whites for blending lighter tones: [titanium dioxide](/e171-titanium-dioxide){.additive} (use depends on local rules)

The best substitute depends on the target shade, stability needs (light, heat, pH), flavor neutrality, and labeling goals.

## How is Lutein made?
Commercial lutein is typically obtained from marigold (Tagetes erecta) petals. The process commonly involves:
- Extracting pigment-rich oleoresin from dried petals with approved food-grade solvents
- Converting lutein esters to free lutein (saponification), when needed
- Purification and formulation (for example, oil dispersions or beadlets) to improve stability and ease of use

In the EU, detailed purity criteria and permitted starting materials/solvents are set out in the additive specifications for E 161b.[^3]

## Is Lutein safe to eat?
Regulators in the U.S. permit “lutein from Tagetes erecta” as a color additive exempt from certification, when used according to regulations and good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, lutein (E 161b) is authorised as a food color under the food additives framework, with specifications and use conditions laid down in law.[^2][^3]

As with all approved colors, safety has been reviewed by authorities. When used as intended, lutein in food is considered safe. If you have specific medical concerns or dietary restrictions, consult your healthcare professional.

## Does Lutein have any benefits?
Lutein is a dietary carotenoid that concentrates in the macula of the eye, where—together with [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin){.additive}—it contributes to the macular pigment.[^4] Research on supplements has examined potential roles in eye health; the NIH-supported AREDS2 study tested lutein and zeaxanthin in an eye health formula for age-related macular degeneration (AMD).[^5] As a food additive, however, lutein is used for color—not to treat or prevent disease.

## Who should avoid Lutein?
- People who prefer to avoid added colors for personal reasons can check labels for “lutein,” “E161b,” “xanthophylls,” or “Tagetes extract.”
- Anyone with a medical condition requiring controlled carotenoid intake, or those advised by a clinician to limit certain additives, should seek personal guidance.

## Myths & facts
- “Lutein is artificial.” False. Commercial lutein is typically extracted from marigold petals, a natural source.[^3]
- “Lutein is the same as beta-carotene.” Not quite. Both are carotenoids, but lutein is a xanthophyll and has different chemical features and color properties.
- “Lutein is a preservative.” No. Its primary function in foods is color, not preservation.

## Lutein in branded foods
On labels, look for “lutein,” “E161b,” “lutein (from Tagetes erecta),” or “xanthophylls.” In the U.S., you may also see “color added” alongside the ingredient. Many products use only small amounts to fine-tune hue, so it may appear near the end of ingredient lists.[^1]
