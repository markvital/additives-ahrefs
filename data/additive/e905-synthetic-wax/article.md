Synthetic wax (E905) is a highly refined, petroleum‑derived wax used in tiny amounts to give foods a smooth, glossy finish or to keep them from sticking. It shows up most often on the outside of confections and in chewing gum coatings, and it is regulated with strict purity and use limits in both the U.S. and the EU. It does not add flavor or nutrition; it’s there to protect texture and appearance.

## At a glance
- What it is: A purified hydrocarbon “Fischer–Tropsch” wax made from synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) that’s refined for food use.
- E-number: E905 (also seen in related forms like E905a mineral oil, E905b petrolatum, and E905c petroleum wax).
- What it does: Works as a glazing agent, moisture barrier, and anti‑stick coating on the surface of foods.
- Where you’ll find it: Confectionery glazes, panned candies, and chewing gum coatings; sometimes grouped with other E905 waxes.
- Common label names: Synthetic wax, hydrocarbon wax, Fischer–Tropsch wax, E905.
- Diets: Typically vegan/vegetarian (petroleum-derived, not animal-based).
- Regulation: Allowed for specific uses with composition and purity specifications set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union (EU).

## Why is Synthetic wax added to food?
Food makers use synthetic wax to solve practical surface problems. A very thin coating can provide gloss, reduce moisture loss, prevent pieces from sticking together, and help candies and dragees roll smoothly during panning. In the U.S., synthetic petroleum wax is specifically permitted for defined uses such as components of chewing gum base and as a protective coating when meeting stringent specifications and good manufacturing practice.[^1] It also appears as a listed component within the chewing gum base regulation, which details substances allowed in gum formulations.[^2]

## What foods contain Synthetic wax?
You’re most likely to see it in:
- Chewing gum coatings and dragees
- Panned or polished confectionery (e.g., candy shells, coated nuts)
- Specialty glazes and release coatings for sweets

On European labels it may appear as “E905” or alongside related entries for the broader wax group, such as [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil), [petroleum jelly](/e905b-petroleum-jelly), or [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax). In the U.S., “synthetic petroleum wax” is named in FDA regulations for permitted uses, especially in chewing gum base and protective coatings that meet identity and purity criteria.[^1][^2]

## What can replace Synthetic wax?
Depending on the product and desired finish, common alternatives include:
- Plant waxes: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax)
- Resin coatings: [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- Other glazing agents and processing aids: [hydrogenated poly-1-decene](/e907-hydrogenated-poly-1-decene), [oxidised polyethylene wax](/e914-oxidised-polyethylene-wax)
- For non-vegan options: [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax)

Choice depends on cost, gloss level, melt point, processing temperature, and dietary preferences.

## How is Synthetic wax made?
“Fischer–Tropsch” synthetic wax is produced by reacting carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) over a catalyst to make long-chain hydrocarbons. The wax fraction is then refined—typically through hydrotreating and filtration—to meet strict limits on residual oils, metals, and other impurities. FDA’s identity specification for synthetic petroleum wax describes this origin and sets compositional parameters for food use.[^1]

## Is Synthetic wax safe to eat?
Regulators judge safety based on the substance’s composition, its intended use, and exposure at typical intake levels. In the U.S., synthetic petroleum wax may be safely used in or on foods in line with its FDA specification and good manufacturing practice; allowed uses are narrowly defined.[^1] In Europe, E‑numbered waxes are authorised food additives, with detailed EU specifications for composition and purity published in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 and use conditions governed by Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^3][^4] EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) has also evaluated related E905 waxes and, based on available data, did not identify safety concerns at authorised use levels.[^5]

## Does Synthetic wax have any benefits?
- Helps candies and dragees keep a smooth, shiny finish.
- Acts as a moisture barrier on the surface, helping preserve texture.
- Reduces sticking and abrasion during manufacturing and transport.

These are functional and cosmetic benefits; synthetic wax does not contribute nutrients.

## Who should avoid Synthetic wax?
- People who prefer to avoid petroleum‑derived ingredients may choose plant‑based alternatives like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax).
- If you follow specific certification schemes (for example, some organic standards), check the rules and the product label to confirm permitted glazing agents.

Allergies to synthetic wax are uncommon because it is a highly refined, inert hydrocarbon used in very small amounts. If you have questions about a specific product, contact the manufacturer.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as plastic.” Fact: Food‑grade synthetic wax is a purified hydrocarbon wax with strict composition limits. It’s not a polymer plastic and is used at trace surface levels.
- “It soaks into the food.” Fact: It forms a thin surface film that mainly affects gloss and release; it is not used to change the food’s composition.
- “More wax means longer shelf life.” Fact: Only small amounts are allowed, and more is not better; manufacturers are limited to good manufacturing practice.

## Synthetic wax in branded foods
You’ll most often spot E905 or “synthetic wax” on labels of:
- Sugar‑shell or panned candies and chocolate lentils
- Chewing gum dragees and polished pieces
- Specialty confectionery glazes

If you’re checking labels, also look for related entries like E905a, E905b, or E905c on EU products, or for plant‑based glazers like [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax).
