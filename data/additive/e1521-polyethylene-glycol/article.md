Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a smooth, water‑soluble polymer used in small amounts to coat, carry, or dissolve other ingredients. In food, it appears as E1521 and helps give tablets and dragees a clean, glossy finish while keeping moisture under control. Regulators in the EU allow it for defined uses and set strict purity rules.

## At a glance
- Also called: E1521, PEG, macrogol (in medicines)
- What it does: glazing/coating agent, carrier and solvent for colors and flavors, moisture control
- Where it shows up: coated food supplements and tablets, chewing‑gum and candy dragees, specialty bakery decorations
- Dietary notes: synthetic (not animal‑derived), neutral taste, odorless

## Why is Polyethylene glycol added to food?
PEG is added because it solves practical problems: it dissolves or carries sensitive ingredients, forms smooth protective films, and helps manage stickiness and moisture. In the European Union, E1521 is an authorized food additive with defined technological functions and use categories set by law.[^4]

## What foods contain Polyethylene glycol?
You are most likely to see PEG in:
- Film‑coated food supplements and vitamin tablets
- Dragee‑style coatings on chewing gum and certain candies
- Specialty surface treatments (for example, to reduce sticking on decorations or compressible mints)

In the EU, its permitted uses and maximum levels are specified by regulation, and most reported use is in food supplements and surface coatings.[^4] Detailed specifications for the additive itself (such as purity and limits for impurities) are also laid down in EU legislation.[^2]

## What can replace Polyethylene glycol?
Depending on the job, food makers may choose other approved additives instead of PEG:
- For glossy coatings: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive} or [shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}
- For edible films and capsules: [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan){.additive} or [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol){.additive}
- For carrying and dissolving flavors: [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol){.additive}, [glycerol](/e422-glycerol){.additive}, or [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol){.additive}
The best substitute depends on the food, the needed texture or shine, and label preferences.

## How is Polyethylene glycol made?
PEG is produced by polymerizing ethylene oxide so that many small units link together into a water‑soluble chain. Food‑grade PEG must meet identity and purity specifications set in EU law, including limits on residual reactants and contaminants.[^2] Scientific reviews describe PEG as a polymer of ethylene oxide supplied in defined average molecular‑weight ranges for food use.[^1]

## Is Polyethylene glycol safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated E1521 and concluded there is no safety concern for its reported uses as a food additive at the levels used in foods.[^1] Very high intakes can have a laxative effect; in fact, specific PEG grades are approved in the United States as active ingredients in over‑the‑counter osmotic laxatives, which illustrates this dose‑related effect.[^3]

## Does Polyethylene glycol have any benefits?
PEG does not add nutrition, but it helps foods and supplements:
- Keep a smooth, non‑tacky surface during storage
- Protect sensitive ingredients by acting as a carrier
- Swallow more easily when used as a tablet or dragee coating

## Who should avoid Polyethylene glycol?
- People who have been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid PEG (for example, due to a known sensitivity) should check labels.
- Anyone who experiences digestive upset from coated supplements or candies may wish to choose products without PEG, as high amounts can have a laxative effect.[^3]
If you have medical questions about PEG, especially if you take PEG‑based laxatives or have kidney or gastrointestinal conditions, speak with your clinician.

## Myths & facts
- “PEG is the same as antifreeze.” Fact: No. Antifreeze commonly uses ethylene glycol, which is a different, much smaller molecule. PEG is a larger, solid or syrupy polymer with different properties.
- “PEG adds flavor.” Fact: PEG is virtually tasteless and odorless; it is used for texture, coating, or as a carrier, not for flavor.
- “PEG is always animal‑derived.” Fact: PEG is synthetic and not sourced from animals.
- “PEG is a preservative.” Fact: PEG is not used to kill microbes; its main roles are coating, carrying, and moisture control.

## Polyethylene glycol in branded foods
You’ll mostly encounter E1521 on labels for coated vitamins and mineral tablets, compressed mints, chewing gum, and some dragee candies. Formulas change often, so the surest way to check is to read the ingredient list for “polyethylene glycol,” “PEG,” or “E1521.”
