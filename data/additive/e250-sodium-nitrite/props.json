  "description": "Sodium nitrite is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula NaNO2. It is a white to slightly yellowish crystalline powder that is very soluble in water and is hygroscopic. It is a useful precursor to a variety of organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, and pesticides, but it is probably best known as a food additive to prevent botulism. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.Nitrate or nitrite -ingested- under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation has been classified as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" by International Agency for Research on Cancer -IARC-.",
