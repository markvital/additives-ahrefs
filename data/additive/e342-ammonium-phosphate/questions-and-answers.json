      "q": "what is the formula for ammonium phosphate",
      "a": "For E342, the ammonium phosphates used are monoammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4) and diammonium phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4); the fully neutral (NH4)3PO4 is unstable and not typically used in foods.",

    {
      "q": "is monoammonium phosphate toxic",
      "a": "It has low toxicity and is permitted as a food additive; within the group ADI for phosphates (e.g., EFSA: 40 mg phosphorus/kg body weight/day), normal food uses are considered safe. Very high intakes can disturb mineral balance, and people with kidney disease should manage phosphate intake.",

      "q": "is ammonium phosphate toxic",
      "a": "At permitted food levels, ammonium phosphates (E342) are considered safe, with a group ADI for phosphates set by EFSA at 40 mg phosphorus/kg body weight/day. Excessive intake may affect mineral balance and is a concern for those with impaired kidney function.",
