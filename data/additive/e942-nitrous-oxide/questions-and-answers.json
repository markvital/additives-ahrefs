      "q": "what is nitrous oxide used for",
      "a": "In foods, E942 is used as a propellant and foaming gas for aerosol whipped cream and similar products, and it helps limit oxidation by displacing oxygen; outside food, it’s also used medically for sedation and analgesia.",

    {
      "q": "why don't dentists use nitrous oxide anymore",
      "a": "Many dentists still use it; where it’s reduced or discontinued, it’s usually due to practice policies, monitoring and ventilation requirements, costs, or infection-control considerations, not because it’s been broadly banned.",

    {
      "q": "how does nitrous oxide work",
      "a": "As a food additive, it dissolves in cream under pressure and expands into fine bubbles when released, whipping and dispensing the product while displacing oxygen to slow oxidation.",

    {
      "q": "how long does nitrous oxide last",
      "a": "In medical/dental use, its effects generally wear off within a few minutes after inhalation stops; in whipped cream, the gas remains in the foam for hours but gradually diffuses out.",

    {
      "q": "is nitrous oxide flammable",
      "a": "No—nitrous oxide isn’t flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can make other materials burn faster and more intensely.",
