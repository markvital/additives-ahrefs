Nitrous oxide (E942) is a colorless gas used in food mainly as a propellant for whipped cream and other foams. It pressurizes cans and helps cream whip into a smooth, stable foam at the push of a nozzle.

## At a glance
- What it does: propellant gas for aerosol whipped cream and culinary foams
- Where it’s found: pressurized whipped cream cans and refillable cream siphons
- What it’s like: colorless, almost odorless, neutral-tasting gas
- Why it’s used: dissolves in cream, expands on release, and creates fine bubbles
- Typical amount: used to pressurize the can; most gas escapes when dispensing
- Regulation: approved in the EU as E942 and permitted in the U.S. when used as a propellant under good manufacturing practice
- Not an allergen: no common allergen concerns; misuse by inhalation is the main risk (not eating)

## Why is nitrous oxide added to food?
Food makers use nitrous oxide to push products out of aerosol cans and to create a fine, creamy foam. The gas dissolves into the cream under pressure. When the valve opens, pressure drops, the gas expands, and tiny bubbles form, making whipped cream light and stable. In the EU, nitrous oxide is an authorized food additive (E 942) for use as a propellant; specifications for identity and purity are set in law.[^1] In the U.S., FDA recognizes nitrous oxide as allowed for use in food as a propellant under good manufacturing practice.[^2]

## What foods contain nitrous oxide?
- Pressurized whipped cream and dessert toppings in cans
- Whipped cream made in refillable siphons (chargers contain nitrous oxide)
- Some specialty culinary foams prepared in professional kitchens

## What can replace nitrous oxide?
Depending on the product and equipment, manufacturers may use other propellant gases:
- [Carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) for some foams and beverages
- [Nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen) for stable, fine-bubble foams and dispensing
- [Propane](/e944-propane) or [butane](/e943a-butane) in certain cooking sprays (not for whipped cream)

For non-aerosol whipped toppings, air plus stabilizers like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan) can help maintain texture without a propellant.

## How is nitrous oxide made?
Commercial nitrous oxide is typically produced by carefully heating ammonium nitrate, which breaks down to nitrous oxide and water vapor. The gas is then cooled, purified, and compressed into cylinders or cartridges for medical, industrial, or food use.[^3]

## Is nitrous oxide safe to eat?
When used as intended as a propellant in food, nitrous oxide is considered safe by major regulators. In the U.S., FDA permits its use in food as a propellant under good manufacturing practice.[^2] In the EU, E 942 has formal identity and purity criteria and is authorized for use as a propellant in foods.[^1] 

Most exposure during eating is brief because the gas quickly disperses into the air once the product is dispensed. The main safety concern is not ingestion but inhalation misuse; high concentrations can displace oxygen and cause dizziness or loss of consciousness. Proper ventilation and avoiding intentional inhalation are important.[^4]

## Does nitrous oxide have any benefits?
- It helps whip cream instantly, creating a smooth, fine foam without mechanical whipping.
- It keeps air out of the can until use, helping maintain product quality while stored.
- It has little to no taste and does not add sweetness, salt, or acidity.

## Who should avoid nitrous oxide?
- Anyone should avoid intentionally inhaling nitrous oxide. Inhaling concentrated gas can reduce oxygen available to the body and can be dangerous.[^4]
- Workers who use cream chargers or aerosol products often should follow ventilation and exposure guidelines to limit occupational exposure.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Eating whipped cream from a can will make you feel the gas.” Fact: The gas largely escapes when you press the nozzle; you’re mostly eating the cream.
- Myth: “Nitrous oxide is the same as smog-forming nitrogen dioxide.” Fact: They are different chemicals; nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a colorless gas used as a propellant, not the brown NO₂ seen in pollution.[^3]
- Myth: “Propellants add flavor.” Fact: Nitrous oxide is essentially tasteless and used for function, not flavor.

## Nitrous oxide in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you’ll typically see “propellant: nitrous oxide” or “E942.” Canned whipped cream and refillable siphon chargers commonly use it. If a product uses a different gas, labels may instead list “propellant: nitrogen (E941)” or “propellant: carbon dioxide (E290).”
