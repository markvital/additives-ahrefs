Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472D) are food emulsifiers. They help oil and water mix, steady foams, and improve texture in many foods. You’ll see them most often in baked goods, spreads, and creamy drinks.

## At a glance
- What it is: An emulsifier made by joining tartaric acid with mono- and diglycerides from edible fats and oils.
- What it does: Helps ingredients blend, stabilizes emulsions and foams, and supports a softer, more even crumb in baked goods.
- Where it’s used: Common in cakes, breads, whipped toppings, creams, and certain beverages.
- Label note: May be listed as E472d or by its full name; the fatty acids can come from vegetable or animal sources.
- Regulatory status: Listed in the European Union with detailed purity criteria.

## Why is Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers use E472D because it keeps mixtures of oil and water from separating. It also supports fine, even bubbles in batters and creams, which can improve volume and mouthfeel. In short, it makes recipes more stable and consistent during mixing, baking, freezing, and storage.

## What foods contain Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
You’ll most often find E472D in:
- Bread and fine bakery wares (for dough stability and crumb texture)
- Whipped toppings, aerated desserts, and ice cream-style products
- Emulsified sauces and dressings
- Certain non-alcoholic beverages and creamers
These uses align with how the additive is listed for a wide range of food categories in international standards under INS 472d.[^3]

## What can replace Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
Possible alternatives depend on the recipe:
- For general emulsifying: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- For strong dough conditioning: [DATEM](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- For similar emulsifier families: [lactic acid esters](/e472b-lactic-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [citric acid esters](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- For thickening/stabilizing water phases: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [sodium carboxy methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose)
Each substitute behaves a bit differently, so formulators often test blends to match the exact texture and stability.

## How is Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids made?
E472D is produced by reacting mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (from edible fats and oils) with tartaric acid. The result is a mixture of esters, along with small amounts of related compounds that are controlled by strict purity criteria set in the EU specification.[^1]

## Is Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids safe to eat?
In the European Union, E472D appears on the Union list of approved food additives. Being on this list means it met the legal safety requirement that additives must not pose a safety concern at the proposed levels of use.[^2] Its identity and purity are defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012, which sets limits for composition and contaminants.[^1]

## Does Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids have any benefits?
This additive does not provide a nutrient benefit, but it can:
- Improve mixing of fat and water
- Support volume and a finer crumb in baked goods
- Help foams hold their shape
- Keep sauces and beverages uniform
These performance benefits help foods stay consistent from batch to batch.

## Who should avoid Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids?
- Vegans, vegetarians, and people with religious dietary rules may wish to check the source of the fatty acids, since mono- and diglycerides can be made from either vegetable or animal fats (manufacturers sometimes state the source on request or on product specs).[^1]
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit certain emulsifiers should follow that guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: E-numbers are “chemicals to avoid.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is assessed and authorized for use in the EU with defined purity rules.[^2]
- Myth: E472D is the same as DATEM. Fact: They are related emulsifiers, but DATEM is the diacetyl tartaric acid ester (E472e) and behaves somewhat differently in doughs.
- Myth: It always comes from animal fat. Fact: The fatty acid source can be vegetable or animal; the EU specification allows edible fats and oils in general.[^1]

## Tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids in branded foods
On labels, look for “E472d” or the full name “tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids.” Many bakery items, toppings, and emulsified drinks use it. If source matters to you, check with the maker or look for products stating “vegetable-based emulsifiers.”
