Xanthophylls (E161) are natural yellow to orange-red pigments from the carotenoid family. In food, they are used mainly as color additives, with examples including lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and astaxanthin. They can come from plants and algae, or be made by synthesis.

## At a glance
- What it is: A group of oxygen-containing carotenoids used as food colors
- The look: Yellow to orange-red shades
- Common members: [lutein](/e161b-lutein), [zeaxanthin](/e161h-zeaxanthin), [canthaxanthin](/e161g-canthaxanthin), [astaxanthin](/e161j-astaxanthin)
- Where it comes from: Plant extracts (like marigold flowers), microalgae, or chemical synthesis
- On the label: “Xanthophylls,” “E161,” or the specific name, such as “lutein (E161b)”

## Why is Xanthophylls added to food?
Food makers use xanthophylls to give foods warm hues, from light yellow to deep orange-red. They blend well in fat-containing foods because they are fat‑soluble. In the European Union, several xanthophylls have E‑numbers within E161 and are defined by detailed purity specifications, which helps ensure consistent performance in foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Xanthophylls?
You will see xanthophylls used as added colors in items like beverages, desserts, spreads, sauces, baked goods, and snacks. Some of the same pigments occur naturally in foods: lutein and zeaxanthin are found in leafy greens like spinach and kale, as well as corn and egg yolks.[^2]

## What can replace Xanthophylls?
Depending on the shade and the recipe, possible alternatives include:
- [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene) or mixed [carotenoids](/e160-carotenoids) for yellow‑orange tones
- [annatto](/e160b-annatto) or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract) for orange to red
- [curcumin](/e100-curcumin) for bright yellow
- [plain caramel](/e150a-plain-caramel) for brown and amber

## How is Xanthophylls made?
There are several routes, depending on the specific xanthophyll:
- Lutein is commonly extracted from marigold (Tagetes erecta) flowers, then saponified to yield free lutein and formulated for use in foods.[^3]
- Zeaxanthin can be obtained by extraction from plant sources (such as marigold/paprika) or produced by chemical synthesis, then standardised for food use.[^4]
- Astaxanthin can be produced from microalgae (Haematococcus pluvialis) or made synthetically; both routes have been evaluated for use in foods or food ingredients.[^5]
- EU law sets identity and purity specifications for several E161 colors to ensure quality and consistency.[^1]

## Is Xanthophylls safe to eat?
In the EU, individual xanthophylls (for example, lutein E161b and canthaxanthin E161g) are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and must meet legal specifications and conditions of use. When used within these legal limits, they are considered safe for their intended purpose in foods.[^1] EFSA has reviewed specific members, such as lutein, and did not identify safety concerns at the levels of use evaluated.[^3]

## Does Xanthophylls have any benefits?
In foods, their main benefit is color. In the body, lutein and zeaxanthin are pigments found in the eye’s macula, and they are being studied for roles in vision; however, color additives are added to foods for appearance, not for health effects.[^2]

## Who should avoid Xanthophylls?
- If you are following a medical diet or have been told to limit certain color additives, check labels and ask a healthcare professional.
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic colors can look for plant- or algae‑sourced versions on the ingredient list.
- As with any additive, those with sensitivities to carriers or solvents in a specific product should review the full ingredient list.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are synthetic.” Fact: Many xanthophylls used in foods are extracted from plants or algae, and some are made by synthesis; both routes are regulated.
- Myth: “Xanthophylls are the same as vitamin A.” Fact: Lutein and zeaxanthin are xanthophylls that do not provide vitamin A.
- Myth: “You can only get xanthophylls from supplements.” Fact: They are present naturally in common foods like leafy greens, corn, and eggs, and are also used as food colors.

## Xanthophylls in branded foods
On labels you might see:
- “Xanthophylls (E161)” as a group name in some markets
- A specific name, such as “[lutein (E161b)](/e161b-lutein),” “[zeaxanthin (E161h)](/e161h-zeaxanthin),” “[canthaxanthin (E161g)](/e161g-canthaxanthin),” or “[astaxanthin (E161j)](/e161j-astaxanthin)”
- A source description like “lutein (from marigold)” or “astaxanthin (from microalgae)”
