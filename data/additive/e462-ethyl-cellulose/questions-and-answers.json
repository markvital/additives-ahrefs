      "q": "how is ethyl cellulose made",
      "a": "It’s made by reacting purified cellulose with ethylating agents (commonly under alkaline conditions) to form ethyl ethers, then washing and drying; the degree of substitution is controlled to tune its properties.",

      "q": "how safe is ethyl cellulose",
      "a": "It is considered safe as a food additive; JECFA assigned an ADI “not specified” and EFSA found no safety concern at reported uses, with minimal absorption and mainly GI passage—very high intakes may cause mild stomach upset.",

      "q": "how to make ethyl cellulose",
      "a": "Industrially, it is produced by alkaline ethylation of cellulose using hazardous ethylating agents under controlled conditions; it isn’t practical or safe to make at home.",

      "q": "how to make gunge slime ethylcellulose",
      "a": "Ethyl cellulose is not water‑soluble, so it won’t make typical water‑based “gunge” slime; for a food-safe slime, use water‑soluble gums like xanthan (E415) or guar (E412) instead.",
