Sodium citrates (E331) are the sodium salts of citric acid. They control acidity, help foods stay stable, and make processed cheese melt smoothly. You’ll find them in drinks, dairy, and many everyday packaged foods.

## At a glance
Sodium citrates are simple salts with practical jobs in food.

- What it is: the sodium salts of citric acid; covers three forms—monosodium, disodium, and trisodium citrate.
- Main roles: acidity regulator and buffer, metal binder (sequestrant), and emulsifying salt in processed cheese.
- Where it’s used: soft drinks and powdered beverages, processed cheeses, desserts, and more.
- Dietary notes: non-animal, gluten-free, and common in vegan and vegetarian foods.

## Why is Sodium citrates added to food?
Food makers add sodium citrates to keep acidity steady, improve flavor balance, and protect quality. As a “sequestrant,” it ties up trace metals that can cause off-flavors or color changes. In processed cheese, it acts as an emulsifying salt so fat and water stay together and the cheese melts evenly.[^1] U.S. standards for pasteurized process cheese list sodium citrate as an allowed emulsifying salt.[^3]

## What foods contain Sodium citrates?
You’ll see sodium citrates in lemon-lime and cola-type soft drinks, sports and energy drinks, flavored waters, and powdered beverage mixes. It’s also common in processed cheese slices and spreads, shelf-stable cheese sauces, some desserts and confections, and a range of packaged foods where pH control or metal binding helps stability.

On labels it may appear as “sodium citrate,” “E331,” or a specific form such as [monosodium citrate](/e331i-monosodium-citrate), [disodium citrate](/e331ii-disodium-citrate), or [trisodium citrate](/e331iii-trisodium-citrate).

## What can replace Sodium citrates?
Swaps depend on the job you need done.

- For tartness and pH control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), [L-tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), or [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid).
- For buffering with less sodium: [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates) or [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates).
- For emulsifying salts in processed cheese: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) are a common alternative.
- For metal binding (sequestration): [calcium disodium EDTA](/e385-calcium-disodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate) in suitable applications.

## How is Sodium citrates made?
Manufacturers neutralize citric acid with a sodium base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate. Adjusting the ratio yields mono-, di-, or trisodium citrate, which are then purified to meet food-grade specifications.[^2]

## Is Sodium citrates safe to eat?
Yes. In the United States, sodium citrate is “GRAS” (Generally Recognized as Safe) for its intended uses, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[^4] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated citric acid and its citrate salts and found no safety concern at current use levels, concluding that a numerical ADI (acceptable daily intake) was not necessary.[^1]

## Does Sodium citrates have any benefits?
For consumers, benefits are mostly about consistent quality. Drinks keep a steady tartness without becoming too sour over time, and processed cheese melts smoothly without oiling off. In many foods, sodium citrates also help maintain color and flavor by tying up reactive metal ions.

## Who should avoid Sodium citrates?
People on sodium‑restricted diets should watch all sources of sodium, including sodium citrate in foods and drinks. Public health guidance in the U.S. recommends limiting total sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day for most adults.[^5] If you have a medical condition requiring strict sodium control, ask your healthcare provider or dietitian how additives like sodium citrate fit into your plan.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as citric acid.” Fact: It’s the sodium salt of citric acid, with milder tartness and strong buffering power.
- Myth: “It makes cheese ‘plastic.’” Fact: It’s an emulsifying salt that helps cheese melt evenly by keeping fat and water together.
- Myth: “It adds a lemon flavor.” Fact: Its main role is to control acidity and bind metals; flavor impact is small.
- Myth: “It’s unsafe because it’s synthetic.” Fact: Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow sodium citrates based on safety evaluations.

## Sodium citrates in branded foods
You’re most likely to see sodium citrate in:
- Lemon‑lime sodas, colas, sports drinks, and flavored waters
- Processed cheese slices, spreads, and jarred cheese sauces
- Powdered drink mixes and some dessert mixes

You may also spot related names such as [disodium citrate](/e331ii-disodium-citrate) or [trisodium citrate](/e331iii-trisodium-citrate) on ingredient lists.
