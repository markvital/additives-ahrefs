Dextrin (E1400) is a group of short-chain carbohydrates made from starch. In foods it works as a carrier, thickener, stabiliser, and sometimes as a glazing aid for a crisp finish. You’ll see it in seasonings, instant mixes, snacks, and confectionery because it dissolves easily and helps dry powders flow.

## At a glance
- Name on label: Dextrin or E1400
- What it does: carrier, emulsifier helper, stabiliser, thickener
- Where it shows up: coatings on snacks and nuts, spice blends, instant soups and sauces, confectionery, powdered drinks
- Source: made by heating starch (such as corn, potato, wheat, or tapioca)
- Regulatory status: authorised as a food additive in the EU; permitted in the U.S. as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used under good manufacturing practice

## Why is Dextrin added to food?
Dextrin helps foods in several simple ways. It makes dry mixes and seasonings flow better and not clump. It carries flavors and colors evenly, and it thickens or stabilises soups, sauces, and fillings. In snacks and nuts, it can act as a light glaze to improve crunch and help spices stick.

## What foods contain Dextrin?
You can find it in:
- Snack coatings and roasted nuts
- Spice rubs and dry seasoning packets
- Instant soups, sauces, and gravy mixes
- Confectionery and bakery glazes
- Powdered beverages and drink mixes
- Ready-to-eat cereals and fortified snack foods

On ingredient lists, it appears as “dextrin” or “E1400.” If the starch source matters to you (for example, corn, potato, or wheat), some labels note the source, but this is not always required.

## What can replace Dextrin?
Depending on the job, food makers may use:
- Other starch-based additives, such as [modified starch](/e14xx-modified-starch){.additive}, including [acid-treated modified starch](/e1401-acid-treated-modified-starch){.additive} or [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch){.additive}
- Gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, or [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum){.additive}
- Fruit-based gelling agents like [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}
- Bulking agents such as [polydextrose](/e1200-polydextrose){.additive}

The best substitute depends on the desired texture, heat stability, and whether the product is a powder or a liquid.

## How is Dextrin made?
Dextrin is produced by heating edible starch. Food-grade “white” or “yellow” dextrins are formed when starch (from sources like corn, potato, wheat, or tapioca) is roasted, often in the presence of a small amount of acid to control the breakdown into shorter chains.[^1] The EU sets identity and purity specifications for E1400 so that the product meets defined quality limits.[^1]

## Is Dextrin safe to eat?
In the European Union, dextrin is an authorised food additive (E1400) with official specifications, which means it has passed a safety evaluation and must meet purity requirements when used in foods.[^1] In the United States, dextrin is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP), meaning only the amount needed to achieve its function is used.[^2] GMP is a regulatory term that requires safe, controlled manufacturing and use levels appropriate for the intended purpose.

## Does Dextrin have any benefits?
For manufacturers, dextrin brings practical benefits:
- It dissolves quickly and helps powders pour without caking.
- It improves adhesion of seasonings to snacks and nuts.
- It stabilises textures in soups, sauces, and confectionery fillings.

For consumers, these functions translate to more consistent flavor, better crunch, and reliable mixing in instant products.

## Who should avoid Dextrin?
- People with specific starch-source allergies or sensitivities (for example, to corn or wheat) should check product labels or contact the maker to confirm the source.
- Individuals on highly restricted diets who must avoid certain carbohydrates may also choose products without dextrin.

If you have a medical condition that requires limiting certain ingredients, discuss label choices with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Dextrin is the same as sugar.” Fact: Dextrin is made of short starch chains. It is a carbohydrate, but it is not table sugar (sucrose). Its role in foods is mainly functional (texture, flow, adhesion), not sweetening.
- Myth: “All dextrin is synthetic.” Fact: Dextrin is derived from food starches and made by controlled heating. Its composition and purity are set by food regulations.[^1]
- Myth: “If a food has dextrin, it must be unhealthy.” Fact: Dextrin is used in very small amounts to improve stability or handling. Safety agencies permit its use under good manufacturing practice.[^2]

## Dextrin in branded foods
Dextrin can appear across many categories, from seasoned snack mixes to instant sauces. To spot it, read the ingredient list for “dextrin” or “E1400.” If you need to know the botanical source (corn, wheat, potato, tapioca), look for products that disclose it on-pack or contact the brand’s customer service.
