Nisin (E234) is a natural antibacterial peptide made by lactic acid bacteria and used as a preservative. It mainly targets certain foodborne bacteria, helping foods like processed cheeses stay safe and fresh for longer. It is approved for use in many regions at controlled levels.

## At a glance
- What it is: An antimicrobial peptide (a short chain of amino acids) produced by Lactococcus lactis.
- What it does: Preserves food by inhibiting certain bacteria, notably Listeria, especially in mildly acidic foods.
- Where it’s found: Commonly in processed and pasteurized cheese products; other uses depend on local rules.
- Labels to look for: “Nisin” or “E234.”
- Safety: Evaluated by EU and U.S. authorities; safe at approved levels.

## Why is Nisin added to food?
Nisin is added to slow the growth of certain Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause serious illness. It is particularly useful in cheese and other foods where mild acidity and heat processing are used, because nisin stays effective under those conditions and helps extend shelf life.[^1]

## What foods contain Nisin?
- United States: Nisin preparation is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) as an antimicrobial agent in specific standardized cheese products, such as pasteurized process cheese spreads, where it is used within set limits.[^2]
- European Union: Nisin is authorized as E234. The authorized food categories and maximum levels are listed in EU additive legislation; manufacturers must follow these legal conditions for any use.[^3]

On ingredient lists, you’ll typically see “nisin” or “E234.”

## What can replace Nisin?
Depending on the food and the microbes of concern, technologists may use:
- [Potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} or [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive}
- [Sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive} in suitable pH ranges
- [Natamycin](/e235-natamycin){.additive}, especially on the surface of cheeses
- [Lysozyme](/e1105-lysozyme){.additive} in certain cheese applications

The best alternative depends on pH, moisture, processing, and desired shelf life.

## How is Nisin made?
Food-grade nisin is produced by fermenting a permitted strain of Lactococcus lactis. After fermentation, it is separated and purified, then standardized to a defined activity according to additive specifications so that manufacturers can dose it accurately.[^4]

## Is Nisin safe to eat?
EU risk assessors have re-evaluated nisin and concluded it is not a safety concern at authorized uses and levels, establishing an acceptable daily intake (ADI) to guide safe use.[^1] In the U.S., nisin preparation is affirmed as GRAS for specified cheese applications when used as directed in federal regulations.[^2]

## Does Nisin have any benefits?
When used correctly, nisin can enhance food safety by suppressing harmful bacteria in susceptible foods, and it can help maintain quality over shelf life. This can reduce the need for more intense heat treatments that might affect taste or texture.

## Who should avoid Nisin?
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit or avoid certain preservatives, follow that guidance.
- People managing a highly restricted or additive-free diet may choose products without added preservatives.
- If you have questions about a specific product, check the ingredient list for “nisin” or “E234” and contact the manufacturer for details.

## Myths & facts
- “Nisin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic.” Fact: Nisin mainly targets certain Gram-positive bacteria in foods; it is used as a food preservative, not as a human medicine.[^1]
- “Nisin replaces good hygiene.” Fact: It’s a safety hurdle that works alongside hygiene and proper processing, not a substitute.
- “Nisin adds lots of sodium.” Fact: It’s used at very low levels, and any sodium from carriers or the formulation is typically minimal in the final food.

## Nisin in branded foods
Nisin most often appears in processed and pasteurized cheese products, and may appear in other permitted foods depending on local regulations. To check a specific brand, read the ingredient list for “nisin” or “E234,” and note that recipes can change over time. Many companies also share additive details on their websites or customer service lines.
