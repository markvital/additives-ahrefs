Lycopene (E160d) is a red pigment found naturally in tomatoes and other red fruits. In foods, it is used as a colour additive to give shades ranging from pink to deep red, especially where a “tomato-like” hue is desired. It can come from tomatoes, fermentation, or be made synthetically, but it works the same in coloring foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: A red, fat‑soluble plant pigment from the carotenoid family that colors foods.
- What it does: Provides pink to red color; stable in fats and oils; sensitive to strong light and oxygen over time.
- Where it’s used: Drinks, sauces, confectionery, dairy desserts, and many tomato-style products.
- Where it comes from: Extracted from tomatoes, produced by fermentation, or made synthetically to food-grade specs.
- Safety: Authorized as a food colour with purity specifications in the EU and U.S. when used as intended.

## Why is Lycopene added to food?
Food makers use lycopene to give or restore red tones that look appealing and signal flavor cues, such as “strawberry,” “grapefruit,” or “tomato.” As a fat‑soluble colour, it disperses well in oily or emulsified foods and can offer a more “natural” label when sourced from tomatoes. In regulations, lycopene belongs to the carotenoid group of colours, alongside [carotenoids](/e160-carotenoids){.additive}.[^1]

## What foods contain Lycopene?
You may find lycopene in:
- Soft drinks and fruit beverages (for pink to red hues)
- Tomato sauces, soups, and ready meals (to standardize color)
- Confectionery, gummies, and chewing gum
- Flavored dairy products and frozen desserts
- Bakery creams, fillings, and icings

In the European Union, lycopene is an authorized colour with specific conditions of use across many categories listed in food additive law.[^2] In the United States, lycopene color additives are permitted for use in foods when they meet the relevant listings and specifications.[^3]

## What can replace Lycopene?
Depending on the target shade and label goals, manufacturers might use:
- Plant-based reds and oranges: [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}, [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive}, or [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins){.additive}.
- Other carotenoids: [beta-carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene){.additive} for orange to yellow tones.
- Synthetic reds where allowed: [Allura Red](/e129-allura-red){.additive} or [Ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r){.additive}.

Each option differs in shade, solubility, stability to heat and light, and regional approval.

## How is Lycopene made?
There are three main routes:
- Tomato extraction: The pigment is concentrated from tomato materials using food‑grade processes, then standardized in a carrier such as vegetable oil for ease of use.[^1]
- Fermentation: Certain microorganisms can produce lycopene, which is then extracted and purified to the same specifications as other sources.[^1]
- Chemical synthesis: Lycopene can be made synthetically, with the final product meeting the same identity and purity criteria for food use.[^1]

In the EU, all sources must comply with one set of specifications for identity, purity, and permitted processing aids.[^1]

## Is Lycopene safe to eat?
Lycopene is authorized as a food colour in the European Union with detailed purity specifications and conditions of use.[^2] In the United States, lycopene-based color additives (including tomato-derived and other listed forms) are permitted for use in foods when they meet their specifications and use limits.[^3] These regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure safety when lycopene is used as intended in foods.

## Does Lycopene have any benefits?
Lycopene is a carotenoid, and it can act as an antioxidant in chemical tests. However, color additives are approved to color foods—not to treat or prevent disease. Research on lycopene from the diet and supplements is ongoing, and results are mixed; people should not rely on lycopene-fortified foods for health claims.[^4]

## Who should avoid Lycopene?
- People with tomato allergy or intolerance may wish to check the source on the label, since some lycopene is derived from tomatoes.
- If a healthcare professional has advised you to avoid certain color additives, read ingredient lists for “lycopene” or “E160d.”
- For supplement users, discuss high-dose lycopene pills with a clinician, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Lycopene only comes from tomatoes.” Fact: It can also be made by fermentation or synthetically, provided it meets food-grade specs.[^1]
- Myth: “Lycopene will make foods taste like tomato.” Fact: It contributes color, not tomato flavor.
- Myth: “Natural lycopene and synthetic lycopene are different in foods.” Fact: They must meet the same identity and purity standards for use as a colour.[^1]
- Myth: “Lycopene is water‑soluble.” Fact: It is fat‑soluble, so it is usually formulated in oils or emulsions for even coloring.

## Lycopene in branded foods
On labels, look for “lycopene,” “E160d,” “tomato lycopene extract,” or similar wording. You’ll often see it in beverages, tomato-based sauces, confectionery, and dairy desserts. Color systems may be listed as “lycopene in vegetable oil” or “lycopene emulsion,” which helps it mix evenly in the product. Availability and usage vary by brand and country, so check the ingredient list for the most accurate information.
