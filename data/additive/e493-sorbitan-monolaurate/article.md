Sorbitan monolaurate (E493) is an emulsifier that helps oil and water mix and stay stable. It is made by joining sorbitan, a sugar alcohol derivative, with lauric acid from edible fats and oils. You’ll often see it in baked goods, spreads, and confectionery to improve texture and shelf life.

## At a glance
- Role: emulsifier and stabiliser that keeps mixtures smooth
- Typical in: bakery mixes, spreads, fillings, confectionery, and sauces
- Family: part of the “sorbitan esters” group alongside E491, E494, and others
- Label names: “sorbitan monolaurate,” “E493”
- Origin: usually from plant oils; exact source depends on the manufacturer

## Why is Sorbitan monolaurate added to food?
Sorbitan monolaurate helps oil and water mix evenly and stay mixed. That keeps sauces from splitting, fillings from weeping, and whipped or creamy products stable. In baking, it can make batters finer and more uniform, which supports volume and a soft crumb. It also helps coatings and chocolatey spreads stay smooth.

## What foods contain Sorbitan monolaurate?
You may find E493 in:
- Cakes, muffins, and dry bakery mixes
- Spreads, margarines, and non-dairy creamers
- Confectionery, fillings, and dessert toppings
- Sauces and dressings
- Some beverage emulsions and flavor systems

In the EU, E493 is an authorised food additive within defined categories and conditions listed in the Union list of food additives. Always check local rules and product labels for specifics.[^4]

## What can replace Sorbitan monolaurate?
Depending on the recipe and the effect needed, formulators might use:
- Other sorbitan esters: [sorbitan monostearate](/e491-sorbitan-monostearate), [sorbitan monooleate](/e494-sorbitan-monooleate), or [sorbitan monopalmitate](/e495-sorbitan-monopalmitate)
- Polysorbates such as [polysorbate 20](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate) or [polysorbate 60](/e435-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monostearate)
- Natural emulsifiers like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) or [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- Other systems such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), or [polyglycerol esters](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- Thickening gums that aid stability, for example [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum)

## How is Sorbitan monolaurate made?
E493 is produced by reacting sorbitan—made by dehydrating [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol)—with lauric acid. The fatty acids used come from edible fats and oils, and the finished material must meet strict identity and purity specifications in the EU.[^1] In short, it is a food-grade ester of sorbitan and lauric acid prepared under controlled conditions to achieve the required composition and quality.[^1]

## Is Sorbitan monolaurate safe to eat?
European food safety experts have re-evaluated sorbitan esters (including E493) and concluded they do not raise safety concerns at reported use levels; a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) was established for this class of additives.[^2] International evaluations also report that sorbitan esters are broken down in the body to fatty acids and sorbitan, which are then further metabolized or excreted.[^3]

As with any additive, actual exposure depends on how much of these foods you eat. Regulations set maximum use levels and purity standards to keep intake within safe bounds.[^4]

## Does Sorbitan monolaurate have any benefits?
- Keeps emulsions stable so products look and taste consistent
- Helps create fine, even texture in baked goods
- Improves spreadability and mouthfeel in fat-based foods
- Can work alongside other emulsifiers to strengthen stability

## Who should avoid Sorbitan monolaurate?
Most people do not need to avoid E493. Those following a strict “no additives” diet or who have been advised by a healthcare professional to limit emulsifiers may choose to avoid it. If you are concerned about the source (plant vs animal), contact the manufacturer; food-grade sorbitan esters are made from fatty acids obtained from edible sources, which can be either vegetable or animal, and many brands use vegetable sources.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as polysorbates.” False. Polysorbates are ethoxylated sorbitan esters (for example, [polysorbate 20](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate)), while E493 is a non-ethoxylated sorbitan ester.
- “It always comes from animal fat.” False. The fatty acids come from edible sources that may be plant or animal; many suppliers use plant oils such as coconut or palm kernel.[^1]
- “It builds up in the body.” No. Sorbitan esters are broken down to common food components (fatty acids and sorbitan) that are further metabolized or excreted.[^3]

## Sorbitan monolaurate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sorbitan monolaurate” or “E493.” It appears in some cake mixes and ready-to-bake products, dessert toppings and fillings, spreads, non-dairy creamers, and certain confectionery. Availability and usage vary by region and brand; check the label to be sure.
