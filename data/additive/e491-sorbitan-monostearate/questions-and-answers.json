      "q": "is sorbitan monostearate safe",
      "a": "Yes—E491 is an approved food emulsifier; EFSA set a group ADI of 10 mg/kg body weight per day (expressed as sorbitan) for sorbitan esters, and it’s considered safe at permitted use levels.",

      "q": "is sorbitan monostearate vegan",
      "a": "Not always—the stearic acid can be sourced from either vegetable oils or animal fat, so vegan status depends on the supplier; check with the manufacturer for plant-derived sources.",

      "q": "how is sorbitan monostearate and sorbitan tristearate different",
      "a": "Sorbitan monostearate (E491) has one stearic acid group, while sorbitan tristearate (E492) has three. The tri-ester is more lipophilic (lower HLB) and is used for stronger water-in-oil emulsification and fat crystal control compared with the mono-ester.",
