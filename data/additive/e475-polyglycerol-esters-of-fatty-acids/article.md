Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids (E475) are emulsifiers that help oil and water mix and stay mixed in foods. Made from short chains of glycerol joined to fatty acids from edible oils, they improve texture, foam, and shelf-life in many products. They are widely approved by food safety authorities and used at levels needed to achieve their effect.

## At a glance
This additive is a workhorse emulsifier and stabiliser used across many everyday foods.

- Also called E475, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, or PGE
- Role: emulsifier and stabiliser that keeps mixtures smooth and uniform
- Typical foods: cakes, whipped toppings, ice cream, margarine and spreads, coffee whiteners, sauces, and bakery fillings
- Label note: may appear as “polyglycerol esters of fatty acids” or “PGE”
- Dietary note: made from edible oils and fats; ask brands if the source (plant vs. animal) matters to you
- Regulatory status: authorised in the EU and listed by the U.S. FDA
- Functionally similar to [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), and [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids)

## Why is Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids added to food?
E475 helps oil and water stay mixed, so products don’t split or “weep.” It improves whipped volume and foam stability in aerated foods, helps spreads stay smooth, and keeps sauces from separating during storage and heating. It can also make doughs and batters mix more evenly, leading to softer crumbs and a finer texture in baked goods.

## What foods contain Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids?
You’re most likely to find E475 in:
- Cakes, muffins, cake mixes, and bakery fillings
- Whipped toppings and aerosol creams
- Ice cream, frozen desserts, and sorbets
- Margarine, spreads, and coffee whiteners/creamers
- Sauces, gravies, and ready-to-eat meals
- Confectionery fillings and dessert sauces

On labels, look for “polyglycerol esters of fatty acids,” “polyglycerol fatty acid esters,” or “E475.”

## What can replace Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids?
The best substitute depends on the food and the job to be done:
- Emulsifiers: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sucrose esters of fatty acids](/e473-sucrose-esters-of-fatty-acids), [propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) for certain confectionery
- Dough/foam strengtheners: [sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate), [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- Stabilizers/thickeners for body: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum)

## How is Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers first link molecules of [glycerol](/e422-glycerol) together to form “polyglycerols,” then react them with food-grade [fatty acids](/e570-fatty-acids). The result is a mixture of esters with different chain lengths that act as effective emulsifiers in foods.[^1] In the EU, detailed identity and purity specifications (such as permitted reactants and impurity limits) are set out in law.[^1]

## Is Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes—when used as intended by regulations. In the European Union, E475 is authorised as a food additive and appears on the Union list in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^2] Its composition and purity are controlled by specifications in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1] In the United States, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are included on the FDA’s Food Additive Status List, indicating they are permitted for specified uses under federal regulations.[^3]

## Does Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids have any benefits?
For consumers, the benefits are mainly about quality: creamier sauces, smoother spreads, stable whipped products, and baked goods with a finer, softer crumb. For makers, it helps recipes tolerate temperature changes and processing, reduces separation, and can improve shelf-life by keeping the texture consistent.

## Who should avoid Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids?
Most people don’t need to avoid E475. If you follow a strict vegetarian, vegan, halal, or kosher diet, you may wish to ask the brand about the source of the fats used. People with very specific ingredient sensitivities should review labels or contact manufacturers, as with any multi-component additive.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s synthetic, so it must be unsafe.” Fact: Safety depends on the substance, dose, and use—not whether it’s made in a factory. E475 is made from edible oils/fats and glycerol and is regulated for purity and use.
- “It’s the same as E476 (PGPR).” Myth: They’re related but different. E475 is a broad family of polyglycerol esters used widely; E476 is a specific polyglycerol polyricinoleate often used in chocolate and some spreads.
- “It hides trans fats.” Myth: E475 is an emulsifier, not a fat substitute. It helps oil and water mix; it doesn’t add or hide trans fat.

## Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids in branded foods
You may see E475 on labels of shelf-stable whipped toppings, premium ice creams, margarine and plant-based spreads, cake mixes and frostings, and ready sauces. The exact recipe varies by brand, so the additive might appear along with other emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins). Check the ingredient list for “polyglycerol esters of fatty acids,” “PGE,” or “E475.”
