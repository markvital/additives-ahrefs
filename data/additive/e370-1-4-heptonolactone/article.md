E370, or 1,4‑Heptonolactone, is a member of the lactone family, a group of small cyclic esters. This page explains what it is used for in foods, how it is made, and what is known about its safety.

## At a glance
- What it is: 1,4‑Heptonolactone is a lactone, which means it is a cyclic ester. Lactones are a well‑known class of food flavoring substances. [^4] [^3]
- Typical role: Where regulations allow, aliphatic lactones are used at very low levels to add creamy, fruity, or buttery notes as flavorings. [^3]
- Labeling: In the EU, approved additives must appear on labels by their functional class and either name or E‑number; E370 would be shown as “1,4‑Heptonolactone” or “E370” when used as an additive. [^2] [^1]
- Regulation varies: Food additives and flavorings are regulated regionally. Authorization and conditions of use differ between the EU and the US. [^1] [^3]

## Why is 1,4‑Heptonolactone added to food?
Lactones are widely used in flavor work because many give smooth, creamy, coconut‑ or peach‑like notes at very small levels. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits a defined list of synthetic flavoring substances, which includes several gamma‑ and delta‑lactones used for flavor. [^3] As a member of the lactone family, 1,4‑Heptonolactone is discussed in the same context.

## What foods contain 1,4‑Heptonolactone?
When used as a flavoring, a lactone like 1,4‑Heptonolactone would be added to foods that rely on creamy or fruity profiles, such as desserts, confectionery, baked goods, or dairy‑style products, and always at very low amounts typical for flavorings. Actual use depends on local authorization and on a product’s recipe. In the EU, additives that are authorized must be declared on the ingredient list, either by name or E‑number. [^2] [^1]

## What can replace 1,4‑Heptonolactone?
- For flavor: Developers typically switch to other approved flavoring lactones or natural flavor extracts that give similar notes, depending on what is allowed in the market. [^3]
- For acidity or tartness in the recipe (if that is the design need, not the additive’s role): options include [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid).
- For texture adjustments separate from flavor (if needed by the product): hydrocolloids such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) or [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum) are common choices.

## How is 1,4‑Heptonolactone made?
Lactones are cyclic esters. Chemically, they form by an internal (intramolecular) reaction of a hydroxy‑acid to make a ring and release water, a reaction called lactonization. [^4] Food‑relevant lactones can also be produced as defined synthetic flavoring substances, provided they appear on the relevant regulatory lists and meet specifications. [^3]

## Is 1,4‑Heptonolactone safe to eat?
Safety depends on authorization, purity, and how much is used. In the US, the FDA permits certain gamma‑ and delta‑lactones as synthetic flavoring substances when used in line with good manufacturing practice, which implies very small amounts that are just enough to achieve flavor. [^3] More broadly in the EU, only additives on the Union list may be used, and they must meet strict rules on identity, purity, and use. [^1]

## Does 1,4‑Heptonolactone have any benefits?
It is not a nutrient and does not provide health benefits by itself. Its value, where allowed, is technological and sensory: it can help deliver a specific creamy or fruity flavor profile in a finished food at very low levels typical of flavorings. [^3]

## Who should avoid 1,4‑Heptonolactone?
- People following personal or medical advice to limit additives or flavorings should check labels and consult a health professional.
- Anyone with concerns about specific ingredients should look for the name “1,4‑Heptonolactone” or “E370” on EU labels, where applicable. [^2]
- For infants, young children, pregnancy, or medical diets, general best practice is to choose foods with simple ingredient lists and follow local dietary guidance.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “If it has an E‑number, it’s automatically unsafe.”  
  Fact: In the EU, E‑numbers are identifiers for additives that have been evaluated and authorized for specific uses and conditions. [^1]
- Myth: “Lactones are solvents.”  
  Fact: “Lactone” is a structural class of molecules (cyclic esters); many are used as flavoring substances at tiny concentrations. [^4] [^3]
- Myth: “Additives don’t have to be listed on the label.”  
  Fact: In the EU, additives must be declared by functional class and name or E‑number in the ingredient list. [^2]

## 1,4‑Heptonolactone in branded foods
If used as an additive in the EU, it would appear on the ingredient list as “1,4‑Heptonolactone” or “E370,” together with its functional class (for example, “flavoring”). [^2] In the US, flavorings are typically declared as “natural flavor” or “artificial flavor,” with the underlying substances regulated under dedicated FDA provisions. [^3]
