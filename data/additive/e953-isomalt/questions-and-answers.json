      "q": "how to make isomalt",
      "a": "Industrial production converts sucrose to isomaltulose via an enzyme (sucrose isomerase), then hydrogenates it (typically over Raney nickel) to yield an equimolar mix of 1,6‑GPS and 1,1‑GPM—together called isomalt.",

    {
      "q": "how to use isomalt",
      "a": "Use it as a bulk sweetener and texturizer in sugar‑free hard candies, lozenges, baked goods, and sugar art; it melts and resists crystallization for casting or pulling. Because it’s ~45–65% as sweet as sugar, it’s often blended with high‑intensity sweeteners, and intake should be moderated to avoid gastrointestinal upset.",

      "q": "what is isomalt made of",
      "a": "An equimolar mixture of two sugar‑alcohol disaccharides derived from sucrose: 6‑O‑α‑D‑glucopyranosido‑D‑sorbitol (GPS) and 1‑O‑α‑D‑glucopyranosido‑D‑mannitol (GPM). On complete hydrolysis it yields glucose (50%), sorbitol (25%), and mannitol (25%).",

    {
      "q": "what is isomalt sugar",
      "a": "A sugar alcohol (E953) made from sucrose that provides about 2 kcal/g and 45–65% the sweetness of sugar, with minimal impact on blood glucose and low cariogenicity.",

    {
      "q": "what is isomalt used for",
      "a": "As a low‑calorie bulk sweetener and stabilizer in sugar‑free hard candies, lozenges, chewing gum, baked goods, coatings, and pharmaceutical tablets; it’s also favored for sugar sculpture due to its resistance to crystallization.",
