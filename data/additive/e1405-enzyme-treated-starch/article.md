Enzyme treated starch (E1405) is a modified starch that has been gently broken down with food-grade enzymes to change how it behaves in recipes. It helps make foods smoother, stable, and easy to process without adding strong flavors of its own. You will see it used as a thickener, stabiliser, or emulsifier in many everyday products.

## At a glance
Here is a quick look at what E1405 does and where you might find it.
- Role in food: thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier
- Where it shows up: soups, sauces, dressings, dairy desserts, bakery fillings, and drinks
- Label names: “E1405,” “enzyme treated starch,” or “food starch-modified”
- Source: starch from plants (such as corn, potato, tapioca, or wheat) processed with enzymes
- Regulatory status: authorised in the EU; allowed in the U.S. as “food starch-modified”

## Why is Enzyme treated starch added to food?
Food makers use E1405 to control texture, keep mixtures from separating, and improve stability during heating, freezing, or storage. Because the starch is partially broken down by enzymes, it can add body without making a product too thick, and it often helps emulsions (like dressings) stay uniform.[^2]

## What foods contain Enzyme treated starch?
You can find E1405 in many foods where smooth texture and stable consistency matter. Examples include:
- Soups and sauces
- Salad dressings and mayonnaise-style products
- Dairy desserts and flavored milks
- Confectionery and fruit preparations
- Bakery fillings and coatings

These use cases are consistent with the broad authorisations and reported uses for modified starches across food categories in Europe.[^3]

## What can replace Enzyme treated starch?
Depending on the recipe, cooks and manufacturers might swap in:
- Other modified starches (see the family of [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch){.additive})
- Gums and hydrocolloids such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}, or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- Emulsifiers like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}

The best substitute depends on the goal—thickening, stabilising, or emulsifying—and on processing steps like heat or freezing.

## How is Enzyme treated starch made?
Manufacturers start with a starch slurry (commonly corn, potato, or tapioca). They add approved food-grade enzymes (such as amylases) to partially hydrolyse the starch. The reaction is then stopped by heat, the product is washed and dried, and the resulting powder is standardised for food use.[^5] In the United States, enzyme treatment is one of the permitted ways to produce “food starch-modified.”[^1]

## Is Enzyme treated starch safe to eat?
Regulators have evaluated modified starches, including E1405, and found no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was “not specified,” which means the additive is considered of low toxicity at normal dietary exposures.[^3] EU specifications also define purity and identity criteria that products must meet before use in foods.[^2]

## Does Enzyme treated starch have any benefits?
- Texture control: adds body while keeping pourability in sauces and beverages.
- Process tolerance: helps foods handle heating, mixing, and shelf life.
- Clean taste: contributes little flavor or color, so the main ingredients shine.

## Who should avoid Enzyme treated starch?
Most people do not need to avoid E1405. However, if the starch is sourced from wheat, U.S. labels must declare the presence of wheat as a major allergen. People with wheat allergy or celiac disease should check ingredient lists for a wheat statement next to “modified food starch.”[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Modified starches are synthetic chemicals.”  
  Fact: E1405 starts as plant starch and is processed with food-grade enzymes to adjust its properties.
- Myth: “Enzyme treated starch is the same as MSG.”  
  Fact: It is a carbohydrate ingredient, not monosodium glutamate (an amino acid salt).
- Myth: “It always makes food gummy.”  
  Fact: Enzymatic treatment can actually lower viscosity, giving smoother, more stable textures.

## Enzyme treated starch in branded foods
On ingredient lists, you may see it written as “E1405,” “enzyme treated starch,” or in the U.S. simply “food starch-modified.”[^1][^2] It appears in many everyday items like soups, sauces, dressings, dairy desserts, and confectionery—especially where a smooth, stable texture is important.[^3]
