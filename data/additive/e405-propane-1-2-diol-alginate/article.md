Propane-1,2-diol alginate (E405), also called propylene glycol alginate or PGA, is a food additive made by modifying alginic acid from algae. It helps keep sauces, drinks, and other foods smooth, thick, and evenly mixed.

## At a glance
- What it is: an alginic acid ester of propylene glycol, known as E405
- What it does: thickener, stabiliser, emulsifier, and carrier for flavors
- Where it’s used: dressings, sauces, desserts, and drinks
- Label names: “propane-1,2-diol alginate,” “propylene glycol alginate,” or “E405”

## Why is Propane-1‚2-diol alginate added to food?
Manufacturers add E405 to make liquids creamier, keep oil-and-water mixtures from separating, and hold foams longer. In the United States, it is permitted as an emulsifier, stabilizer, and thickener when used under good manufacturing practice (GMP), which means only the minimum amount needed is used.[^1] In the European Union, it is an authorised food additive with specific rules on where and how it can be used.[^3]

GMP stands for good manufacturing practice, a legal standard that controls how much of an additive can be used to achieve the intended effect and no more.

## What foods contain Propane-1‚2-diol alginate?
You may find E405 in:
- Salad dressings and sauces
- Flavored or carbonated drinks
- Fruit preparations, jams, and dessert toppings
- Dairy and plant-based desserts

Exact uses and maximum levels vary by country. In the EU, permitted food categories and conditions are listed in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and related updates.[^3] On labels, look for “E405,” “propylene glycol alginate,” or “propane-1,2-diol alginate.”

## What can replace Propane-1‚2-diol alginate?
The best substitute depends on the recipe and acidity.
- Other alginates: [alginic acid](/e400-alginic-acid){.additive}, [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive}
- Gums for thickening/stability: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- Fruit-based gels: [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}

Keep in mind that E405 often performs well in acidic foods, so you may need to adjust the formula when swapping.

## How is Propane-1‚2-diol alginate made?
E405 is produced by partially esterifying alginic acid (a natural polysaccharide) with propylene glycol. Food-grade E405 must meet identity and purity specifications set by law in the EU, which describe its composition and quality tests, and it is defined similarly in U.S. regulations.[^2][^1]

Alginic acid itself is the base material for alginates such as E405; it is listed separately as E400 with its own specification in EU law.[^2]

## Is Propane-1‚2-diol alginate safe to eat?
E405 is approved for use in the United States under 21 CFR 172.858 and must be used according to GMP.[^1] In the European Union, it is authorised as a food additive and must comply with detailed composition and purity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2] These regulations reflect risk assessments that consider how much people typically consume when the additive is used as intended.[^3]

If you follow normal eating habits, exposure comes mainly from foods where it is intentionally added within legal limits.

## Does Propane-1‚2-diol alginate have any benefits?
Benefits relate to food quality, not nutrition:
- Improves texture and mouthfeel in sauces and desserts
- Helps oil and water stay mixed in dressings and beverages
- Stabilises foams and suspensions so products stay uniform on the shelf

These functions can reduce recipe separation and help deliver consistent taste and appearance.

## Who should avoid Propane-1‚2-diol alginate?
Most people do not need to avoid E405. If your healthcare professional has advised you to limit propylene glycol or alginates, read ingredient lists for “E405,” “propylene glycol alginate,” or “propane-1,2-diol alginate.” When in doubt, consult your clinician or a dietitian for advice tailored to your situation.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E405 is the same as antifreeze.”  
  Fact: The name includes “propylene glycol,” but E405 is a food-grade alginate ester evaluated and regulated for use in foods.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “All E-numbers are synthetic.”  
  Fact: E405 is derived from alginic acid (E400), a carbohydrate used to make several alginate additives.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s just propylene glycol.”  
  Fact: E405 is a different substance from [propylene glycol](/e1520-propylene-glycol){.additive}; it is an alginic acid ester designed to thicken and stabilise foods.

## Propane-1‚2-diol alginate in branded foods
Ingredient lists will show “E405,” “propylene glycol alginate,” or “propane-1,2-diol alginate.” Product websites and customer service lines can confirm usage. Availability and permitted uses differ by country, so the same brand may use E405 in one market and not in another.
