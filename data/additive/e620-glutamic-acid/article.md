Glutamic acid (E620) is an amino acid used as a flavor enhancer to boost the savory “umami” taste in foods. It occurs naturally in many foods and is also produced for use in seasonings, soups, snacks, sauces, and other savory products.

## At a glance
This quick guide covers what glutamic acid is, where it shows up, and how it’s regulated.

- What it is: An amino acid used as a flavor enhancer (umami)
- E-number: E620 (European Union)
- Where it’s used: Seasoning mixes, packet soups and noodles, savory snacks, sauces, bouillon, and processed meats
- Related additives: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [monopotassium glutamate](/e622-monopotassium-glutamate), [calcium diglutamate](/e623-calcium-diglutamate), [monoammonium glutamate](/e624-monoammonium-glutamate), [magnesium diglutamate](/e625-magnesium-diglutamate)
- Typical daily limit (EU): 30 mg per kg body weight per day (as glutamic acid equivalents)

## Why is Glutamic acid added to food?
Food makers add glutamic acid to boost savory, meaty, broth-like taste known as umami. It helps round out flavors and make foods taste richer and more satisfying.[^1]

Glutamic acid and its salts (the “glutamates,” E620–E625) are classic flavor enhancers. They are often used alongside 5′-ribonucleotides such as [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), or [disodium 5′-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide) in savory snacks, soups, and sauces.

## What foods contain Glutamic acid?
You’ll most often find added E620 in savory products like seasoning blends, instant soups and noodles, snacks, sauces, bouillon, and processed meats. In the European Union it is designated as E620 and has defined identity and purity specifications.[^3] Glutamic acid also occurs naturally as part of proteins in many foods.[^4]

On ingredient lists, look for “glutamic acid,” “L-glutamic acid,” or simply “E620” in regions that use E-numbers.

## What can replace Glutamic acid?
If you need the same umami lift, consider:
- Other glutamates: [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate), [monopotassium glutamate](/e622-monopotassium-glutamate), [calcium diglutamate](/e623-calcium-diglutamate), [monoammonium glutamate](/e624-monoammonium-glutamate), [magnesium diglutamate](/e625-magnesium-diglutamate)
- Umami boosters: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), or [disodium 5′-ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide)
- Kitchen alternatives: aged cheeses, tomatoes, mushrooms, seaweed, fermented sauces, and long-cooked stocks

## How is Glutamic acid made?
Most commercial glutamic acid is produced by food-grade fermentation, typically using selected strains of bacteria such as Corynebacterium glutamicum fed with carbohydrate sources (e.g., sugars). The glutamic acid is then isolated and purified to meet strict specifications for food use.[^1]

## Is Glutamic acid safe to eat?
In the EU, glutamic acid and its salts (E620–E625) are authorized flavor enhancers with defined purity criteria. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 30 mg/kg body weight per day, expressed as glutamic acid, for total dietary exposure to added glutamates.[^1] Specifications for E620 are laid down in EU legislation.[^3]

In the United States, the FDA considers added glutamate (for example, as [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate)) to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice. A small number of people report short-term, mild and transient symptoms after eating large amounts of added glutamate, but controlled studies have not consistently confirmed a causal link.[^2]

## Does Glutamic acid have any benefits?
From a food-tech point of view, the main benefit is better flavor: glutamic acid adds umami and enhances savory notes, so products can taste fuller and more balanced. It also occurs naturally as a common, non‑essential amino acid in proteins, which is why many whole foods taste savory to begin with.[^4]

## Who should avoid Glutamic acid?
- People who notice they are sensitive to large servings of added glutamates may choose to limit foods listing E620–E625.[^2]
- EFSA advises keeping intake within the ADI, noting that high consumers (especially young children) could exceed it if many glutamate‑enhanced foods are eaten in the same day.[^1]

If you have specific dietary needs or a medical condition, check labels and consult a qualified professional.

## Myths & facts
A few quick clarifications help separate rumor from reality.
- Myth: “E620 and MSG are completely different.” Fact: E620 is glutamic acid; E621 (MSG) is its sodium salt. Both supply the same glutamate in food.[^3]
- Myth: “Glutamates cause true allergic reactions.” Fact: The FDA does not classify added glutamate as an allergen, and reports of sensitivity are uncommon and not consistently reproduced in blinded studies.[^2]
- Myth: “Natural glutamate is safe but added glutamate isn’t.” Fact: The body handles glutamate the same way whether it comes from foods naturally or from approved additives used in foods.[^2]

## Glutamic acid in branded foods
You’ll see it most in savory pantry items. Check ingredient lists on seasoning packets, instant noodles and soups, bouillon, sauces, snack seasonings, and processed meats for “glutamic acid,” “L‑glutamic acid,” or “E620” (in regions that use E‑numbers). Many brands use it together with [inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate) or [guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate) for a stronger umami profile.
