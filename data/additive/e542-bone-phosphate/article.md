Bone phosphate (E542) is a calcium phosphate prepared from edible animal bones. Food makers use it in tiny amounts to keep powders free-flowing or to carry other ingredients evenly. Because it comes from animal sources, it does not fit vegetarian, vegan, kosher, or halal diets unless a product is specifically certified.

## At a glance
Bone phosphate is a mineral additive from animal bones that helps dry foods handle better.

- What it is: a purified, bone‑derived form of calcium phosphate
- What it does: helps prevent clumping and can act as a carrier for minor ingredients
- Where it shows up: some powdered seasonings, mixes, and specialty products
- Diet notes: not suitable for vegetarians or vegans; check for kosher/halal certification
- Regulations: authorized in the EU with strict purity limits; usage today is fairly limited

## Why is Bone phosphate added to food?
Manufacturers add Bone phosphate to help powders stay free‑flowing and easy to mix. It can also serve as a “carrier,” meaning it helps spread very small amounts of flavors, colors, or nutrients evenly through a product.[^2]

## What foods contain Bone phosphate?
You’re most likely to see it in dry, powdered foods that need to pour smoothly and resist caking. Examples can include seasoning blends, dry mixes, and certain specialty confections. It is not very common on modern ingredient lists, so many shoppers may never see it. Look for “E542” or “bone phosphate” on the label.

## What can replace Bone phosphate?
Food makers often pick plant‑based or mineral alternatives with similar jobs:
- [Tricalcium phosphate](/e341iii-tricalcium-phosphate){.additive} or broader [calcium phosphates](/e341-calcium-phosphates){.additive}
- [Silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide){.additive}
- [Cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive} or [microcrystalline cellulose](/e460i-microcrystalline-cellulose){.additive}
- [Calcium carbonates](/e170-calcium-carbonates){.additive} or [magnesium carbonates](/e504-magnesium-carbonates){.additive}

## How is Bone phosphate made?
Bone phosphate is produced from edible animal bones that are cleaned, degreased, and deproteinized. The bone material is then heated (calcined) to yield a purified mineral largely composed of calcium phosphate (the same mineral framework found in bone), with strict limits on contaminants such as heavy metals and fluorides set in the specification.[^1]

## Is Bone phosphate safe to eat?
In the European Union, Bone phosphate (E542) is an authorized food additive. Its identity and purity are defined in law, including maximum levels for impurities, and its permitted uses are controlled under the EU food additives framework.[^1][^2] In the United States, a closely related substance, tricalcium phosphate (a calcium phosphate salt), is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for specified uses, which helps illustrate the long history of safe use of calcium phosphate salts in foods.[^4]

## Does Bone phosphate have any benefits?
Bone phosphate doesn’t add taste or texture you can notice, and it’s used in very small amounts. It may contribute tiny amounts of calcium and phosphorus, but it is not intended as a nutrient supplement.

## Who should avoid Bone phosphate?
- Vegetarians and vegans, since it is animal‑derived
- People who keep kosher or halal, unless a product is certified
- Individuals who need to limit phosphorus (for example, some people with chronic kidney disease), who are often advised to watch for “phos‑” ingredients and added phosphates on labels[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Bone phosphate is the same as MSG.” Fact: They are unrelated; MSG is a flavor enhancer, while Bone phosphate is a mineral additive that prevents caking.
- Myth: “It makes food taste meaty.” Fact: It’s essentially tasteless at the tiny amounts used.
- Myth: “All phosphates are synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Calcium phosphates occur naturally in bones and teeth; Bone phosphate is purified from edible bones.
- Myth: “It’s a major source of calcium.” Fact: It’s added at very low levels, so it isn’t a meaningful calcium supplement.

## Bone phosphate in branded foods
To find it in the wild, scan ingredient lists for “bone phosphate,” “edible bone phosphate,” or “E542.” If you avoid animal‑derived additives, many brands now choose plant‑based or mineral alternatives; when in doubt, contact the manufacturer or look for vegetarian/vegan or kosher/halal certification.
