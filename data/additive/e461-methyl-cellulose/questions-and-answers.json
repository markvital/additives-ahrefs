      "q": "what is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose",
      "a": "Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (often labeled E464) is a cellulose ether closely related to methyl cellulose (E461), made by adding methyl and hydroxypropyl groups to plant cellulose. It’s used as a thickener, stabilizer, and film‑former that dissolves in cold water and gels on heating.",

      "q": "is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose safe",
      "a": "Yes—regulators (e.g., EFSA/JECFA) consider it safe for use in foods, with no numerical ADI needed at reported uses, and it is GRAS in the U.S. Because it isn’t digested, large amounts may cause gas, bloating, or a laxative effect in some people.",
