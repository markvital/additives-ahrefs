      "q": "what is a protease",
      "a": "A protease (E1101) is an enzyme that catalyzes proteolysis—cutting peptide bonds to break proteins into smaller fragments.",

    },
    {
      "q": "what does protease do",
      "a": "In foods, E1101 proteases break down proteins to modify texture and processing—for example tenderizing meat, improving dough handling, clarifying beer, and creating protein hydrolysates.",

    {
      "q": "what does protease break down",
      "a": "Proteases break down proteins into peptides and amino acids by hydrolyzing peptide bonds.",

    {
      "q": "what is a protease inhibitor",
      "a": "A protease inhibitor is a substance that blocks protease activity; some occur naturally in foods (e.g., in legumes), and others are used as drugs to inhibit specific proteases.",

    },
    {
      "q": "where is protease produced",
      "a": "Proteases are made by animals, plants, and microorganisms; for food use (E1101) they are commonly produced by microbial fermentation (e.g., Aspergillus or Bacillus) or extracted from sources like papaya or pineapple, and less often from animal tissues.",
