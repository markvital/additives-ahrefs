Alkannin (E103) is a red dye found in the roots of the alkanet plant. It once appeared on older color lists, but it is not authorized for use as a food additive in the European Union or the United States today.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural red plant pigment from alkanet (Alkanna tinctoria) roots
- Main role: Food colorant (historically; not currently authorized in EU/US)
- Status: Not permitted for use in foods in the European Union or the United States
- Where you’ll find it: Not expected in compliant foods; more common in non-food uses like dyes and cosmetics
- Label names: Alkannin, E103

## Why is Alkannin added to food?
Alkannin provides a deep red to purple hue, especially in fats and oils, so it was historically used as a colorant. Today, it is not on the European Union’s “Union list” of permitted food additives, so its use in foods is not authorized in EU member states.[^1] In the United States, it is not among the color additives permitted for use in foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[^3]

## What foods contain Alkannin?
In the EU and the U.S., you should not find alkannin (E103) in legally compliant foods, because it is not authorized for food use in the EU and is not an FDA-permitted color additive in the U.S.[^1][^3] If you see it on a label, the product may be noncompliant in those markets or labeled for a different regulatory jurisdiction.

## What can replace Alkannin?
If a red color is needed, several permitted alternatives are widely used:
- Plant-based reds like [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive} and [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins){.additive}
- Insect-derived [cochineal](/e120-cochineal){.additive} (carmine) for heat-stable, vibrant reds
- Orange-red carotenoids such as [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}, [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}, [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene){.additive}, and [carotene](/e160a-carotene){.additive}

The best substitute depends on the food’s pH, fat content, processing temperature, and the desired shade.

## How is Alkannin made?
Alkannin is a naturally occurring pigment found in the roots of the alkanet plant (Alkanna tinctoria).[^4] Traditional dye making involved extracting the pigment into oils or alcohol, but food-grade manufacture is not authorized in the EU because the additive itself is not on the Union list.[^2]

## Is Alkannin safe to eat?
Regulators have not approved alkannin for use in foods in the European Union or the United States, so it does not have an established acceptable daily intake (ADI) for food use in those systems. In practical terms, this means its safety for use as a food color has not been established through current EU or FDA approvals, and it should not appear in compliant foods in those markets.[^2][^3]

Note: ADI stands for “acceptable daily intake,” the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.

## Does Alkannin have any benefits?
As a color additive, any benefit would be visual—providing a red hue. It does not add nutrition. Because it is not authorized for food use in the EU or U.S., any functional benefits in foods are not recognized by those regulators.

## Who should avoid Alkannin?
- Consumers in the EU and U.S. generally will not encounter alkannin in compliant foods due to regulatory status.[^1][^3]
- If you are sensitive to plant dyes, be aware that non-food products (like cosmetics or crafts) may still use alkanet-derived colorants. Always follow label directions.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “If it has an E-number, it’s approved.”  
  Fact: Some historical E-numbers are no longer authorized for food use in the EU; E103 is one of them.
- Myth: “Natural colors are always allowed.”  
  Fact: “Natural” does not guarantee regulatory approval. Authorization depends on safety assessments and law, not origin.
- Myth: “E-numbers mean synthetic additives.”  
  Fact: Many E-numbers are natural or nature-identical; an E-number is simply a code system used in the EU.

## Alkannin in branded foods
Major brands in the EU and U.S. do not list E103 on current ingredient labels because it is not authorized in those markets. If you see alkannin or alkanet listed on a food product, double-check the product’s country of sale and regulatory compliance.
