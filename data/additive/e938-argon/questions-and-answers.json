    {
      "q": "what element has 18 electrons",
      "a": "Argon (E938); a neutral argon atom has 18 electrons because its atomic number is 18.",

    {
      "q": "what element has 18 neutrons",
      "a": "The argon isotope argon‑36 (36Ar) has 18 neutrons (36 − 18 = 18).",

    {
      "q": "what element has 18 protons",
      "a": "Argon—its atomic number is 18, meaning it has 18 protons.",

    {
      "q": "what element has 17 protons and 18 neutrons",
      "a": "Chlorine‑35; that nucleus (17 protons, 18 neutrons) belongs to chlorine, not argon.",

    {
      "q": "how many valence electrons does argon have",
      "a": "Eight; its outer shell is full (3s2 3p6).",

    {
      "q": "what is argon used for",
      "a": "As food additive E938, it’s used as an inert packaging gas and propellant to displace oxygen in modified-atmosphere packaging and beverage/wine dispensing, helping prevent oxidation and spoilage.",

    {
      "q": "how many neutrons does argon have",
      "a": "The most abundant isotope, argon-40, has 22 neutrons; natural argon also includes argon-36 (18 neutrons) and argon-38 (20 neutrons).",

    {
      "q": "is argon flammable",
      "a": "No—argon is nonflammable and chemically inert; its main hazard is oxygen displacement (asphyxiation) in confined spaces.",
