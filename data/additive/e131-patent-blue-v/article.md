Patent Blue V (E131) is a bright, water‑soluble synthetic blue dye used to color foods in parts of Europe. It helps create vivid blues and, when blended with other colors, greens and purples. In the United States, it is not approved for use in foods.

## At a glance
- Synthetic blue food color (triphenylmethane family), also known as Food Blue 5, Acid Blue 3, and C.I. 42051.
- Approved for certain uses in the European Union (EU), with identity and purity specifications set in EU law; not approved for food use in the United States.
- Used mainly in beverages, sweets, and decorations to give a strong blue hue; blends well to make secondary colors.
- Alternatives include other blues like [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf) and [indigotine](/e132-indigotine), or natural options such as [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins).

## Why is Patent blue v added to food?
Color shapes how we expect food to taste. Patent Blue V adds a clean, intense blue that signals flavors like “blue raspberry” or mint. It is water‑soluble and reasonably stable in acidic drinks, so manufacturers use it to make appealing, consistent colors in beverages, candies, and desserts.

## What foods contain Patent blue v?
In the EU, Patent Blue V may be used in specific food categories and within set limits defined by EU law. You may find it in soft drinks, syrups, confectionery, dessert toppings, cake decorations, and similar items where a bright blue tone is desired.[^3] Outside the EU, rules differ. For example, it is not permitted in U.S. foods.[^4]

## What can replace Patent blue v?
- Other artificial blues: [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf) gives a similar shade and is widely used; [indigotine](/e132-indigotine) offers a darker, more indigo tone.
- Natural colors: [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins) from fruits give blue‑violet hues in certain pH ranges; [chlorophylls and chlorophyllins](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) can contribute to green when blended.
- Blends: Combining a blue dye with a yellow such as [tartrazine](/e102-tartrazine) or [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf) can produce custom greens and teals.

## How is Patent blue v made?
Patent Blue V is produced by chemical synthesis. EU specifications describe it as the sodium or calcium salts of sulfonated triphenylmethane dyes, and set requirements for purity, subsidiary coloring matters, and contaminants.[^2] These legally defined specifications help ensure batches are consistent for food use.

## Is Patent blue v safe to eat?
Safety assessments in the EU are carried out by EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority. EFSA re‑evaluated Patent Blue V (E131) and established an acceptable daily intake (ADI), a health‑based limit that indicates the amount that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable risk.[^1] In the EU, permitted uses and maximum levels are set so that typical intakes remain within this framework.[^3]

Regulatory decisions are not the same worldwide. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Patent Blue V for use in foods; only specific blue colors (such as FD&C Blue No. 1 and FD&C Blue No. 2) are allowed in the U.S.[^4]

## Does Patent blue v have any benefits?
- Makes products visually appealing and consistent from batch to batch.
- Stable in many acidic, water‑based foods and drinks, which helps maintain a clear blue color.
- Useful for blending to create secondary colors like green or teal without affecting taste.

## Who should avoid Patent blue v?
- People who know they have reacted to Patent Blue V or similar colorants should avoid it and consult a healthcare professional. EFSA’s review notes hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, though such cases are uncommon.[^1]
- Shoppers in countries where it is not permitted (such as the United States) will not encounter it in foods, but travelers should check labels when abroad.[^4]

Tip: On labels, look for “E131” or names such as “Patent Blue V,” “Acid Blue 3,” or “C.I. 42051.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Patent Blue V is the same as FD&C Blue No. 1.” Fact: They are different dyes; FD&C Blue No. 1 is [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf), while Patent Blue V is E131.
- Myth: “It’s banned in Europe.” Fact: It is authorized for specific foods and within set limits in the EU.[^3]
- Myth: “All artificial colors are unregulated.” Fact: In the EU, identity and purity are defined in law, and safety is assessed by EFSA.[^2][^1]

## Patent blue v in branded foods
Brand recipes change, and rules differ by country. If you want to check a product, read the ingredient list for “E131” or “Patent Blue V.” In the EU you may see it in blue drinks, candies, or decorative toppings; in the U.S. you should not find it in foods because it is not approved there.[^4]
