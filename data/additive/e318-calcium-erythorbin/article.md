Calcium erythorbin (E318) is an antioxidant used to protect color and flavor in foods. It is the calcium salt of erythorbic acid, a close chemical cousin of vitamin C that helps keep foods from browning or turning rancid.

## At a glance
- What it is: the calcium salt of erythorbic acid, used as an antioxidant and color protector
- What it does: slows oxidation, helps cured meats keep their pink color, and protects flavors
- Where it shows up: cured meats, canned or processed seafood, cut potatoes and vegetables, beverages, and sauces
- Label names: “Calcium erythorbin,” “Calcium erythorbate,” or “E318”
- Dietary notes: vegan-friendly; contributes only tiny amounts of calcium at normal use levels
- Shelf stability: heat-stable enough for cooking and pasteurization

## Why is Calcium erythorbin added to food?
Food makers add calcium erythorbin to slow oxidation. Oxidation can make fats turn rancid, colors fade, and fresh-cut produce brown. In cured meats, erythorbate salts help speed the curing reaction with nitrite and help keep the pink color stable, a role often called a “cure accelerator.”[^2] In plain terms, it helps foods look and taste the way they should for longer.

## What foods contain Calcium erythorbin?
You might find E318 in:
- Cured meats and sausages (as a cure helper and antioxidant)
- Processed or canned fish and shellfish
- Cut or canned vegetables and potatoes to limit browning
- Beverages, fruit preparations, and sauces where flavor and color need protection

On ingredient lists, look for “Calcium erythorbin,” “Calcium erythorbate,” or “E318.” Erythorbate salts (for example, [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate)) are common in cured meats and play similar roles.[^2]

## What can replace Calcium erythorbin?
Depending on the recipe and regulations, common substitutes include:
- [Ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate) for cure acceleration and antioxidant action
- [Sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate) when a sodium salt is preferred
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to help control browning and metal-catalyzed oxidation in some foods
- Natural antioxidants like [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary) or mixed tocopherols such as [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract) and [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol)

## How is Calcium erythorbin made?
Calcium erythorbin is produced by neutralizing erythorbic acid with a food-grade calcium base (such as calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate), forming the calcium salt. Chemically, it is simply the erythorbate anion paired with calcium.[^3] Erythorbic acid itself is typically made from carbohydrate sources through fermentation and chemical steps similar to those used for making vitamin C.

## Is Calcium erythorbin safe to eat?
International scientific bodies have evaluated the erythorbic acid family. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern for the reported uses of erythorbic acid (E 315) and sodium erythorbate (E 316), which share the same active erythorbate component.[^1] In cured meats, U.S. regulations describe how erythorbate and ascorbate salts can be used as cure accelerators, reflecting long-standing, controlled use in that category.[^2]

ADI stands for acceptable daily intake, a science-based estimate of daily exposure that is considered safe over a lifetime. For erythorbate, evaluations have not identified safety concerns at typical food-use levels when good manufacturing practice is followed.[^1]

## Does Calcium erythorbin have any benefits?
- Food quality: helps keep cured meats pink, slows browning in cut produce, and protects flavors from going “stale.”
- Processing: can reduce the time needed for nitrite curing by helping nitrite chemistry proceed efficiently in meats.[^2]
- Nutrition: it is not the same as vitamin C and is not used to provide vitamin activity. Any added calcium from this ingredient is very small because use levels are low.

## Who should avoid Calcium erythorbin?
- People with a known sensitivity to erythorbates or ascorbates should avoid products listing this ingredient.
- If your healthcare provider has advised you to avoid specific antioxidants or additives, follow that guidance.
- For everyone else, normal dietary exposure from labeled foods is considered acceptable by major safety evaluations.[^1]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s just vitamin C.” Fact: Calcium erythorbin is related to vitamin C but does not act as a vitamin in the body.
- Myth: “It dyes meat pink.” Fact: It doesn’t add color; it helps nitrite curing work properly so cured meats keep their natural cured color.[^2]
- Myth: “It’s a strong preservative that kills germs.” Fact: Its main job is antioxidant protection; it supports quality but is not a primary antimicrobial.
- Myth: “It adds lots of calcium.” Fact: Use levels are low, so the calcium contribution is negligible.

## Calcium erythorbin in branded foods
You’ll most often see erythorbate salts on labels for hot dogs, deli meats, bacon, canned seafood, and prepared potato or vegetable products. Look for “Calcium erythorbin,” “Calcium erythorbate,” or “E318” in the ingredient list. In cured meats, you may also see related ingredients like [sodium erythorbate](/e316-sodium-erythorbate), [sodium ascorbate](/e301-sodium-ascorbate), [sodium nitrite](/e250-sodium-nitrite), or [potassium nitrite](/e249-potassium-nitrite).
