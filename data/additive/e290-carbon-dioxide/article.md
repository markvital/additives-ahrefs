Carbon dioxide (E290) is the colorless, odorless gas that gives drinks their fizz and helps push product out of aerosol cans. In food, it also works as a packaging gas to keep some foods fresh for longer by limiting oxygen exposure.

## At a glance
Carbon dioxide is a common processing gas in foods and drinks.
- What it is: The same gas that carbonates beverages; listed as E290 on EU labels.
- What it does: Provides bubbles, acts as a propellant, and helps protect foods in modified atmosphere packs.
- Where you’ll see it: Sparkling water and soft drinks, beer, seltzers; whipped cream cans; some packaged meats and produce.
- Dietary notes: Vegan and vegetarian friendly; not an allergen.
- Regulation: Approved in the U.S. and EU for use in foods at good manufacturing practice levels.

## Why is Carbon dioxide added to food?
Carbon dioxide is added to make beverages effervescent, to act as a propellant in aerosol foods, and to handle and process foods under pressure or cold temperatures. In the U.S., it is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice for these purposes.[^1] In the EU, it is authorized as food additive E 290 and used as a packaging gas and propellant.[^2]

## What foods contain Carbon dioxide?
You will most often find E290 in:
- Carbonated drinks: sparkling water, sodas, seltzers, kombucha, beer, and some wines.
- Aerosol foods: some spray oils and culinary foams use CO2 as the propellant; whipped cream typically uses [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide){.additive}.
- Modified-atmosphere packaging (MAP): some meats, cheeses, salads, and fresh pasta are packed with a protective gas mix that can include CO2 (often with [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen){.additive} or [argon](/e938-argon){.additive}).

On labels, look for “carbonated,” “carbon dioxide,” “CO2,” “packaged in a protective atmosphere,” or “propellant: E290.”

## What can replace Carbon dioxide?
Alternatives depend on the job:
- For packaging and propellant uses: [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen){.additive}, [argon](/e938-argon){.additive}, or [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide){.additive} are common choices.
- For preserving freshness in some foods: other approved preservatives can be used when appropriate, such as [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive} or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive}.
- For tartness instead of fizz: acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} add tang without carbonation.

Each substitute changes texture, taste, or shelf life differently, so formulators pick based on the product.

## How is Carbon dioxide made?
Food‑grade CO2 is captured from natural sources or from clean industrial fermentation streams, then purified, dried, filtered, and finally liquefied and stored under pressure before use.[^2] It can be compressed into cylinders as a liquid and released as a gas on demand.[^3]

## Is Carbon dioxide safe to eat?
Yes. In the U.S., carbon dioxide is affirmed as GRAS as a direct food ingredient when used at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the EU, E290 has official purity criteria that set strict limits for impurities, supporting its safe use in foods.[^2] Carbon dioxide is also listed in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives, which many countries use as a reference.[^4]

## Does Carbon dioxide have any benefits?
- Sensory: It creates bubbles, a cooling bite, and helps lift aromas in carbonated drinks.
- Quality: In protective packaging, CO2 can slow the growth of many spoilage microbes and displace oxygen, helping maintain quality.
- Processing: As dry ice (solid CO2), it chills or freezes foods quickly and cleanly, then simply evaporates.

## Who should avoid Carbon dioxide?
Some people find carbonation uncomfortable due to bloating or reflux. If your healthcare provider recommends limiting carbonated drinks or gas‑forming foods, choose still beverages and products without added CO2.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Carbon dioxide in food is the same as carbon monoxide.  
  Fact: They are different gases with different safety profiles and uses.
- Myth: CO2 adds calories.  
  Fact: Carbon dioxide is a gas with zero calories.
- Myth: Carbonated water is always high in acid.  
  Fact: CO2 makes water mildly acidic, but the pH varies; added acids in soft drinks usually make them more acidic than plain sparkling water.
- Myth: “Packaged in a protective atmosphere” means chemicals were added.  
  Fact: It typically means inert gases like CO2 or [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen){.additive} replaced the air in the pack.

## Carbon dioxide in branded foods
You’ll see E290 in many well‑known products:
- Sparkling waters and seltzers (for example, major brands of plain and flavored sparkling water).
- Soft drinks from global soda brands.
- Beers and some ready‑to‑drink cocktails.
- Aerosol culinary foams and sprays that list “propellant: carbon dioxide.”
- Many supermarket meats, salads, and cheeses labeled “packaged in a protective atmosphere.”

Check ingredient lists for “carbonated water,” “carbon dioxide,” “CO2,” or “propellant: E290.”
