      "q": "does fermentation produce carbon dioxide",
      "a": "Yes—yeast alcoholic fermentation of sugars produces carbon dioxide (E290), which leavens bread and carbonates beverages; lactic acid–type fermentations produce little or no CO2.",

    {
      "q": "where to refill food grade co2",
      "a": "At beverage gas suppliers or homebrew shops, gas/welding distributors that offer beverage/food-grade CO2, draft-beer service companies, or some fire-extinguisher service centers—ask specifically for food/beverage-grade CO2 (E290).",

    {
      "q": ". during sugar fermentation, how much carbon dioxide (g) was produced? (5 points)",
      "a": "Theoretical yield for glucose: C6H12O6 → 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2, so 180 g glucose makes 88 g CO2 (~0.49 g CO2 per g glucose consumed); multiply this factor by the grams of sugar actually fermented.",

      "q": ". rainwater will combine with which atmospheric gas in order to create carbonic acid?",
      "a": "Carbon dioxide (E290); it dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid.",

    {
      "q": "how to treat low carbon dioxide in blood",
      "a": "Low CO2 (bicarbonate) in blood is a medical issue indicating a respiratory or metabolic imbalance; treatment depends on the cause (e.g., correcting acidosis, fluids, adjusting ventilation) and should be guided by a clinician. It isn’t treated by consuming carbonated drinks or food-grade E290.",

    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a compound",
      "a": "Yes—carbon dioxide is a chemical compound (CO2) made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.",

    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a pure substance",
      "a": "Yes—pure CO2 is a pure substance, and food‑grade E290 is purified to high specifications for use in foods and beverages.",
      "answeredAt": "2025-10-12T02:46:57.117Z"
    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide bad for you",
      "a": "At the levels used in foods and drinks, carbon dioxide (E290) is considered safe (approved in the EU and GRAS in the U.S.); the main risks are from breathing high concentrations or mishandling dry ice. Acidic, sugary carbonated beverages can contribute to dental erosion, but the CO2 additive itself isn’t a toxic concern at typical exposures.",

    },
    {
      "q": "where does carbon dioxide come from",
      "a": "Food‑grade carbon dioxide typically comes from natural wells, fermentation streams (e.g., breweries), or captured industrial CO2, then is purified for use in carbonation, packaging, and as a propellant.",
