      "q": "what is carbon dioxide",
      "a": "Carbon dioxide (CO2, additive E290) is a colorless, odorless gas composed of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. It occurs naturally in the atmosphere, is produced by respiration and combustion, and is captured for food use to carbonate drinks and provide packaging atmospheres.",

    {
      "q": "how to treat low carbon dioxide in blood",
      "a": "Low CO2 (bicarbonate) on a blood test reflects an acid-base imbalance, so treatment targets the underlying cause—such as correcting metabolic acidosis, adjusting ventilation, or managing kidney issues—under medical supervision. Drinking carbonated beverages or ingesting E290 does not correct it.",

    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a compound",
      "a": "Yes—CO2 is a chemical compound consisting of one carbon atom covalently bonded to two oxygen atoms.",

    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a pure substance",
      "a": "Pure CO2 is a single chemical substance. Food-grade E290 is highly purified CO2 that meets strict identity and impurity limits before it is used in beverages or modified-atmosphere packaging.",

    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide bad for you",
      "a": "At typical levels in foods and carbonated drinks, CO2 is considered safe; it is permitted as E290 in the EU and GRAS in the U.S. Hazards arise from breathing very high concentrations (which can displace oxygen) or improper handling of liquid CO2 or dry ice.",

    },
    {
      "q": "where does carbon dioxide come from",
      "a": "Suppliers capture CO2 from natural wells, fermentation (e.g., breweries, bioethanol plants), or industrial off-gases, then purify, liquefy, and repackage it for food-grade uses like carbonation and protective atmospheres.",

    {
      "q": "what does low carbon dioxide mean",
      "a": "Low CO2 on a metabolic panel usually indicates low bicarbonate, pointing to metabolic acidosis, chronic hyperventilation, or kidney issues. It signals the need for medical evaluation; it is not about dietary CO2 intake.",

    },
    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas",
      "a": "Yes—CO2 is the primary long-lived greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.",

    },
    {
      "q": "do we breathe out carbon dioxide",
      "a": "Yes—human respiration produces CO2 as a waste product. We inhale oxygen-rich air and exhale air enriched with CO2 generated during cellular metabolism.",

    },
    {
      "q": "what is carbon dioxide in blood test",
      "a": "The CO2 value on a standard metabolic panel mainly reflects bicarbonate levels, which help assess the body’s acid-base balance. Abnormal results guide clinicians in diagnosing metabolic or respiratory disorders.",
