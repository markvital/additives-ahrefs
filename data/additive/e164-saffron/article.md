Saffron (E164) is a natural yellow-orange color made from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower. It also brings a distinct floral aroma and gentle bitterness, so it functions as both a colorant and a seasoning in foods.

## At a glance
- What it is: A natural color from the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus, usually used whole or powdered.
- What it does: Colors foods a golden yellow to orange and adds a unique aroma and taste.
- Where you’ll see it: Rice dishes, baked goods, desserts, dairy, confectionery, and some beverages.
- Labeling: In the EU it can appear as “E164” or “saffron.” In the U.S. it appears as “saffron” or a permitted color declaration.
- Color tone: Bright golden-yellow that can deepen toward orange with higher amounts.
- Solubility: Colors water-based foods well because its main pigments are water-soluble.

## Why is saffron added to food?
Saffron is added to give a rich golden color and a signature aroma that signals premium or traditional recipes. Its coloring components (crocins) disperse well in water-based foods, so a small pinch can tint a whole pot of rice or custard. Because it also adds flavor, it can replace both a colorant and a spice in one step.

## What foods contain saffron?
You’ll most often find saffron in:
- Rice and grain dishes like paella or risotto
- Baked goods, buns, biscuits, and cakes
- Dairy foods such as custards and ice creams
- Confectionery and chocolates
- Syrups, cordials, and some liqueurs

## What can replace saffron?
There is no perfect flavor match, but several natural colors can achieve a similar yellow tone:
- Curcumin from turmeric for a bright yellow hue: [curcumin](/e100-curcumin)
- Orange-yellow carotenoids: [beta-carotene](/e160a-carotene)
- Plant-based yellows and oranges such as [annatto](/e160b-annatto) or [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
- Pale yellow options like [riboflavin](/e101-riboflavin)
- For brown-golden tones, caramel color: [caramel](/e150-caramel)

These alternatives color well, but none provide saffron’s distinctive aroma.

## How is saffron made?
Saffron is harvested by hand from the Crocus sativus flower. The red stigmas are separated, gently dried to preserve color and aroma, and then sold whole or ground. In the EU, E164 refers specifically to saffron obtained from the dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L., with defined identity and purity specifications.[^1]

## Is saffron safe to eat?
In the European Union, saffron is an authorized food color (E164) with official purity specifications, and it has a long history of culinary use.[^1] In the United States, saffron is a color additive exempt from certification and is permitted for coloring foods when used in line with FDA regulations.[^2]

## Does saffron have any benefits?
Technologically, saffron provides a bright, appealing color and a unique aroma, which can improve the sensory quality of foods. Research has explored potential health effects at supplemental doses, but these findings do not reflect the tiny amounts used only to color or flavor foods.[^3]

## Who should avoid saffron?
- People with known allergies to saffron should avoid it.
- During pregnancy and breastfeeding, saffron is considered safe in typical food amounts, but higher, medicinal doses are not advised; talk to a healthcare professional if you have questions.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- “Saffron is just turmeric.” False. Turmeric provides color through curcumin, but it does not reproduce saffron’s aroma or flavor.
- “E-numbers are always artificial.” False. E-numbers are codes for approved additives; saffron (E164) is natural.
- “All yellow colors taste the same.” False. Many yellow colors add little or no flavor, while saffron adds a distinct aroma and gentle bitterness.

## saffron in branded foods
On EU labels, saffron may appear as “E164” or by name. In the U.S., color additives exempt from certification can be declared by their common name (for example, “saffron”) or with a permitted color declaration under labeling rules in 21 CFR 101.22.[^4]
