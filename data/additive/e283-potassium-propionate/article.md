Potassium propionate (E283) is a food preservative that helps keep baked goods free of mold. It is the potassium salt of propionic acid and is used in many countries to extend shelf life, especially in bread and other bakery items. It’s valued when manufacturers want mold control without adding sodium.

## At a glance
- What it is: The potassium salt of [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid){.additive}; a mold-inhibiting preservative.
- What it does: Slows the growth of mold and some spoilage microbes in foods with a bread-like pH.
- Common in: Packaged breads, rolls, tortillas, and other baked goods.
- Label reading: May appear as “potassium propionate,” “potassium propanoate,” or “E283.”
- Swaps: Often interchangeable with [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} or [sodium propionate](/e281-sodium-propionate){.additive}.

## Why is Potassium propionate added to food?
Manufacturers add potassium propionate to stop mold from growing, which helps keep products like bread fresher for longer between baking and eating. It works well in the slightly acidic to neutral pH of many baked goods and does not affect flavor much.

## What foods contain Potassium propionate?
You’ll most often find potassium propionate in:
- Packaged sliced bread, burger buns, and rolls
- Tortillas and flatbreads
- Sweet bakery items like cakes and pastries

These uses reflect how regulators and industry report the propionates (E280–E283) are mainly used in bread and fine bakery wares.[^1]

## What can replace Potassium propionate?
Depending on the recipe and label goals, common alternatives include:
- Other propionates: [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate){.additive} or [sodium propionate](/e281-sodium-propionate){.additive}
- Sorbates: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid){.additive} or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate){.additive}
- Benzoates for some acidic foods: [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate){.additive}
- Process changes: lower pH with [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid){.additive} or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}, tighter packaging, lower moisture, or refrigeration

## How is Potassium propionate made?
Food-grade potassium propionate is produced by neutralizing propionic acid with potassium hydroxide, then purifying and drying the resulting salt to meet purity specifications.[^2] The EU sets identity and purity criteria (such as assay and limits on impurities) for E283 to ensure consistent quality.[^2]

## Is Potassium propionate safe to eat?
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated propionic acid and its salts (E280–E283) and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels in food.[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists potassium propionate among substances that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^3]

## Does Potassium propionate have any benefits?
- Helps keep bread and similar foods mold-free, reducing spoilage and extending shelf life.[^1]
- Offers a sodium-free option compared with [sodium propionate](/e281-sodium-propionate){.additive}, which can help formulators when aiming to limit sodium.

## Who should avoid Potassium propionate?
- People on potassium-restricted diets (for example, some individuals with chronic kidney disease) should consider the total amount of potassium from all sources, including potassium-based additives, and follow their healthcare provider’s advice.[^4]
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to propionates should check labels and choose products without this preservative.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E-numbers are unsafe.” Fact: An E-number means the additive is authorized for use in the EU after safety evaluation.
- Myth: “Potassium propionate is an antibiotic.” Fact: It’s a preservative that inhibits mold growth at food-use levels; it is not used as a drug.
- Myth: “All propionates taste sour.” Fact: At common use levels in bread and similar foods, potassium propionate has little to no noticeable taste impact.

## Potassium propionate in branded foods
You’re most likely to see potassium propionate in the ingredient lists of mass-produced breads, rolls, tortillas, and packaged pastries. On labels it may be written as “potassium propionate,” “potassium propanoate,” or “E283.” If you’re avoiding it, look for “no preservatives” breads or bakery items that rely on shorter shelf life, refrigeration, or alternative preservation methods.
