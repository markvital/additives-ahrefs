Ethulose (E467) is a plant‑based cellulose derivative used to thicken, stabilize, and emulsify foods. It helps sauces, drinks, and desserts keep a smooth, even texture without adding flavor or color. It is widely approved for use and is not digested like ordinary carbohydrates.

## At a glance
Ethulose is a handy texture helper that shows up in many everyday foods.

- Names: Ethulose; Ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose; E467
- What it does: Thickener, stabiliser, emulsifier
- Where it comes from: Modified cellulose from plant fiber
- What it’s like: Off‑white powder, makes smooth, stable gels or solutions in water
- On the label: “Ethulose,” “Ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose,” or “E467”
- Typical uses: Sauces and dressings, dairy-style desserts, fillings, beverages, and diet or gluten-free recipes

## Why is Ethulose added to food?
Food makers use Ethulose to build body and keep mixtures from separating. It helps water and oil stay mixed, keeps particles evenly suspended, and gives a smooth mouthfeel that holds up to heat, acid, and shear. In the European Union, it is listed as a food additive with the technological functions of thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier.[^1]

## What foods contain Ethulose?
You’re most likely to find Ethulose in products that need steady, uniform texture:
- Salad dressings and sauces where it prevents separation
- Spoonable or drinkable desserts where it adds creaminess without extra fat
- Bakery fillings and glazes that must not weep or run
- Flavoured drinks and syrups that need consistent thickness
- Some gluten‑free or reduced‑fat foods to replace body and improve stability

On ingredient lists it may appear as Ethulose, Ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, or E467.

## What can replace Ethulose?
Several other thickeners and stabilisers can play a similar role, depending on the recipe:
- Gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum)
- Pectins: [pectins](/e440-pectins) for jams, fruit fillings, and some drinks
- Cellulose ethers: [methyl cellulose](/e461-methyl-cellulose), [hydroxypropyl cellulose](/e463-hydroxypropyl-cellulose), [sodium carboxy‑methyl cellulose](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose)
- Plain [cellulose](/e460-cellulose) for bulking with less thickening

Choice depends on desired texture, clarity, temperature tolerance, and labeling needs.

## How is Ethulose made?
Ethulose is made by chemically modifying purified plant cellulose. The cellulose is first alkalised (typically with sodium hydroxide), then reacted to add ethyl and hydroxyethyl groups—commonly using ethyl chloride and ethylene oxide. These steps create a cellulose “ether” that dissolves or swells in water and provides thickening and stabilising action. Final material must meet identity and purity specifications set in EU law, including limits for by‑products and defined performance ranges.[^1]

## Is Ethulose safe to eat?
Based on a comprehensive review of cellulose ethers (E 460–E 469), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there was no safety concern for their use at reported levels. These cellulose derivatives are not digested or absorbed to a significant extent and show low toxicity in studies; EFSA did not set a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI).[^2] As with other non‑digestible fibers, very high intakes may cause mild gastrointestinal effects such as softer stools.

## Does Ethulose have any benefits?
For food texture, Ethulose provides reliable thickening, suspending, and emulsion stability even in acidic or heated products. Because it is not meaningfully digested, it contributes negligible calories and does not add sweetness, flavor, or color to the food.[^2]

## Who should avoid Ethulose?
Most people can consume Ethulose without issues. Individuals who are sensitive to sudden increases in dietary fiber or who experience bloating from fiber-like additives may prefer to limit it, especially in large amounts.[^2] If you have a specific medical diet, check with a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “Ethulose is just plastic in food.” False. It is a cellulose derivative made from plant fiber and functions like a non‑digestible gum in recipes.
- “Ethulose contains alcohol.” Misleading. Although “ethyl” appears in the name, Ethulose is a stable polymer and does not contain or release drinking alcohol in foods.
- “It’s a preservative.” Not really. Its main roles are thickening, stabilising, and emulsifying; it does not prevent microbial growth by itself.

## Ethulose in branded foods
On labels, look for “Ethulose,” “Ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose,” or “E467.” In the U.S., cellulose ethers, including ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, are listed on FDA’s Food Additive Status List, which points to how these substances are regulated for use in foods.[^3] Availability and allowed uses can vary by country, so always check local rules and the ingredient list of the specific product.
