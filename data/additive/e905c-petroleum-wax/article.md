Petroleum wax (E905c) is a food-grade wax refined from petroleum. It is used in tiny amounts to coat or glaze foods, reduce stickiness, and help products keep their shape and moisture. You’ll most often find it on the outside of foods rather than mixed in.

## At a glance
- Other names: paraffin wax, petroleum wax; related: [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil){.additive}, [petroleum jelly](/e905b-petroleum-jelly){.additive}, [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax){.additive}
- What it does: glazing agent and release agent that adds shine, prevents sticking, and slows moisture loss
- Where it’s used: fruit and confectionery coatings, chewing gum base, pan-release and processing aids
- Typical amounts: very small; usually forms a thin outer layer or is part of a gum base

## Why is Petroleum wax added to food?
Food makers use petroleum wax because it forms a smooth, stable film. That film:
- gives a glossy finish on sweets and fruits
- acts as a moisture barrier to help keep foods from drying out
- reduces stickiness so candies and gums don’t clump
- works as a release aid so products come out of molds or pans more easily

In the EU it is authorized as a glazing agent, meaning it is used on the surface of foods to protect or decorate them.[^1]

## What foods contain Petroleum wax?
You are most likely to encounter E905c in:
- Chewing gum, as part of the gum base to improve chew and prevent sticking[^3]
- Coated confectionery, where a tiny amount is polished onto the surface
- Waxed fruits (for example, some citrus) to reduce moisture loss and scuffing
- As a processing or release aid so products come out of equipment smoothly

Not every product in these categories uses petroleum wax. Some use other waxes such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive} or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}.

## What can replace Petroleum wax?
Common substitutes include:
- [Carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive}: very hard, high-gloss finish for candies and fruits
- [Candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}: plant-based polish with a slightly softer gloss
- [White and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive}: natural wax often used on cheese and confectionery
- [Shellac](/e904-shellac){.additive}: a resin used for high-gloss coatings on sweets and pills

Choice depends on the desired shine, hardness, melting point, and whether a plant-based or animal-derived option is preferred.

## How is Petroleum wax made?
Petroleum wax is obtained during petroleum refining. Wax fractions are separated from heavy oil streams, then further purified. Food-grade waxes are highly refined mixtures of mostly saturated hydrocarbons and must meet strict purity limits, including specifications that control impurities such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[^1] EFSA describes these waxes as refined petroleum-derived hydrocarbons with defined melting behavior suited to glazing uses.[^2]

## Is Petroleum wax safe to eat?
Regulators have reviewed these waxes and set detailed specifications and use rules:
- European Union: E905c is authorized as a food additive (glazing agent) with compositional and purity criteria listed in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1] EFSA re-evaluated petroleum-derived waxes in the E905 group and found no safety concern at the reported uses and levels.[^2]
- United States: FDA permits petroleum-based waxes as components of chewing gum base under 21 CFR 172.615, which lists the substances allowed in gum base.[^3] FDA also regulates closely related substances such as petrolatum for specified food uses, reflecting oversight of this class of materials.[^4]

When used as intended, exposure is very low because only thin surface layers are applied or the wax is a small fraction of gum base.[^2]

## Does Petroleum wax have any benefits?
For the food, yes:
- Helps keep fruits and candies from losing moisture
- Adds a clean, glossy look
- Reduces stickiness in handling and packaging
- Improves mold and pan release during processing

For the eater, the wax itself does not add taste or nutrition; its benefit is mainly product quality and freshness.

## Who should avoid Petroleum wax?
- People who prefer to avoid petroleum-derived ingredients for personal or dietary reasons can choose products coated with plant or animal waxes like [carnauba](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive} or [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive}.
- If you are following specific guidance from a healthcare professional about limiting certain additives, check labels for “petroleum wax,” “paraffin wax,” or “E905c.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Petroleum wax is the same as raw crude oil.” Fact: Food-grade wax is highly refined and must meet strict composition and purity specifications before use.[^1]
- Myth: “It adds flavor.” Fact: It is tasteless and used on surfaces or as a small part of gum base.
- Myth: “It’s always used on fruit.” Fact: Many fruits are unwaxed or use other waxes such as [carnauba](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive}.

## Petroleum wax in branded foods
On labels you may see it listed as “petroleum wax,” “paraffin wax,” or “glazing agent (E905c).” It most often appears on chewing gum ingredient lists (as part of gum base) and on some polished candies. For fresh produce, look for a note like “edible coating” on packaging or display signs; producers may also specify the type of wax used.
