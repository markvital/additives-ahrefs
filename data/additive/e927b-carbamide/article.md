Carbamide (also called urea) is a simple nitrogen-containing compound used in a few specialized food applications. In regulated amounts, it can help with dough handling or texture and is tightly controlled by food safety rules. Consumers mostly encounter it on labels under the name “urea” or “carbamide.”

## At a glance
Carbamide is the common name for urea, a small molecule that occurs naturally in the body and can also be made industrially.  
Food-grade carbamide is allowed only in limited uses and must meet strict purity standards.  
You may see it on ingredient lists as “urea” or “carbamide.”

## Why is Carbamide added to food?
Carbamide is used in small amounts for technological functions, such as helping with dough processing or maintaining texture in certain specialty products. In the European Union (EU), its use is limited to specific food categories defined in law, and only at levels needed to achieve its effect.[^3] In regulatory terms, these uses are narrow compared with many other additives.

## What foods contain Carbamide?
Use in foods is uncommon and restricted. Which foods may contain it depends on local rules:
- In the EU, permitted food categories and any maximum levels are listed in the additive regulation and its annexes.[^3]
- In the United States, urea appears on the FDA’s Food Additive Status List, which summarizes its regulatory standing; use must comply with the conditions described by FDA.[^4]

To check a specific product, read the ingredient list for “urea” or “carbamide.”

## What can replace Carbamide?
Alternatives depend on why it is being used:
- For dough strengthening or conditioning, bakers may choose [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), enzymes such as [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase), or emulsifiers like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins).
- If a different additive had been used historically for similar roles, such as [azodicarbonamide](/e927a-azodicarbonamide) in some flour treatments, modern formulations often favor enzyme systems or antioxidant improvers instead.

Manufacturers select substitutes based on the food, processing conditions, and local regulations.

## How is Carbamide made?
Modern food-grade carbamide is synthesized from ammonia and carbon dioxide under high pressure and temperature, then purified to meet food specifications.[^1] In the EU, those specifications (including identity and purity criteria) are laid out in the food additive specifications regulation.[^2]

## Is Carbamide safe to eat?
Safety depends on dose and context, and regulators set strict limits:
- The EU lists carbamide (E 927b) as a permitted additive only in specific foods and requires it to meet defined purity criteria before use.[^2][^3]
- In the U.S., the FDA includes urea on its Food Additive Status List; any use must comply with FDA’s conditions and good manufacturing practice.[^4]

Urea is also a normal product of protein metabolism in humans and is handled by the body’s usual pathways at everyday dietary exposures.[^5]

## Does Carbamide have any benefits?
Carbamide does not add nutrition. Its benefits are technological: it can support processing or texture in certain recipes. Because its permitted uses are limited, many foods will never need or contain it.[^3]

## Who should avoid Carbamide?
Most people do not need to avoid carbamide at the very low levels allowed in food. People who have been advised by their healthcare professional to monitor nitrogenous compounds (for example, due to specific kidney conditions) can review labels and discuss any concerns. Urea is a normal metabolic waste product that the body eliminates, primarily via the kidneys.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Carbamide in food comes from animal urine.  
  Fact: Food-grade urea is synthesized industrially from ammonia and carbon dioxide, then purified to meet specifications.[^1][^2]
- Myth: Carbamide is widely used in many processed foods.  
  Fact: Its use is limited to a small number of applications defined by regulation, and many foods never contain it.[^3]

## Carbamide in branded foods
Ingredients lists are your best guide. Look for “urea” or “carbamide.” If present, it will appear near other minor ingredients used for processing or texture. Because its use is limited, you may encounter it only rarely compared with more common additives.
