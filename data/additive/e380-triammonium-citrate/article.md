Triammonium citrate (E380) is the ammonium salt of citric acid used to control acidity and keep foods stable. It acts as a buffer and a sequestrant, which means it can hold onto trace metals that might otherwise cause off-flavors or color changes. It appears on labels as “E380” or “triammonium citrate.”

## At a glance
- What it is: The ammonium salt of [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) used as an acidity regulator and sequestrant.
- What it does: Buffers pH and helps protect taste and color stability in foods and drinks.
- Where it’s found: A variety of processed foods and beverages in small amounts.
- Label names: “Triammonium citrate,” “E380.”

## Why is Triammonium citrate added to food?
Food makers use triammonium citrate to keep acidity (pH) steady and to bind trace metals that can affect taste, color, or shelf life. In EU specifications, its functional classes include acidity regulator and sequestrant.[^1] It is an authorised food additive in the European Union under the E‑number E380.[^2]

## What foods contain Triammonium citrate?
You may find E380 in some beverages, desserts, confectionery, and other processed foods that need pH control or metal ion binding for stability. In the EU, it is permitted for use in a range of food categories listed in the Union list of food additives (Annex II of the food additives regulation). Specific permissions and any maximum levels depend on the food category.[^2]

## What can replace Triammonium citrate?
Depending on the recipe, manufacturers might use other acidity regulators or buffers instead:
- [Citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- [Sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- [Potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- [Calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates)
- [Phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- [Sodium carbonates](/e500-sodium-carbonates) or [potassium carbonates](/e501-potassium-carbonates)

The best substitute depends on taste, sodium or potassium limits, and how strongly the product needs to resist pH changes.

## How is Triammonium citrate made?
Triammonium citrate is produced by neutralising [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with a source of ammonia, such as food‑grade [ammonium hydroxide](/e527-ammonium-hydroxide), and then isolating and drying the salt. This straightforward neutralisation route is the basis of the EU purity specification for E380.[^1]

## Is Triammonium citrate safe to eat?
Within the European Union, E380 is authorised for use and must meet detailed purity criteria before it can be sold. These specifications help ensure identity and quality.[^1] Its use is also limited to the food categories and conditions set out in the Union list; when used under these rules, it is considered acceptable for its intended technological function.[^2]

## Does Triammonium citrate have any benefits?
For consumers, the “benefit” is mainly in product quality. As a buffer and sequestrant, E380 helps keep flavor, color, and clarity more consistent over shelf life by stabilising pH and binding metals like iron and copper that can catalyse changes.[^1]

## Who should avoid Triammonium citrate?
Most people do not need to avoid E380. If your healthcare provider has advised you to limit ammonium or nitrogen intake for a specific medical reason, check labels and choose products accordingly. When in doubt, ask your clinician or dietitian.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s the same as household ammonia.  
  Fact: Triammonium citrate is a stable salt, not a gas. It is used in tiny amounts and must meet strict purity specifications when used as a food additive.[^1]

- Myth: If it has an E‑number, it’s unsafe.  
  Fact: An E‑number means the additive is authorised in the EU for specific uses after a safety and technological assessment, and its use is restricted to listed food categories and conditions.[^2]

## Triammonium citrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “triammonium citrate” or “E380.” It most often appears in foods and drinks where steady acidity and flavor stability are important. Availability and use vary by brand and recipe, so checking the label is the easiest way to know if it’s present.
