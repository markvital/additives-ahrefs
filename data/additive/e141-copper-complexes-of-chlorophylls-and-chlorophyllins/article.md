Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins (E141) are green food colors made by bonding copper to plant chlorophyll. They keep foods looking bright green even when heated or stored in acidic conditions. Two forms exist: E141(i), which is fat‑soluble, and E141(ii), which is water‑soluble.

## At a glance
- What it is: A green color made from plant chlorophyll with copper added
- E‑number: E141, in two forms — E141(i) “copper complexes of chlorophylls” and E141(ii) “copper complexes of chlorophyllins”
- What it does: Adds and stabilizes green color in foods, especially where heat or acidity would dull natural greens
- Typical products: Confectionery, desserts, sauces, canned or processed vegetables, drinks
- Label names: “E141” or “copper complexes of chlorophylls/chlorophyllins”
- Dietary notes: Plant‑derived; generally suitable for vegetarians and vegans

## Why is Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins added to food?
Food makers use E141 because it holds a vivid green color better than plain plant chlorophyll under heat, light, and acidic conditions. Copper in the molecule helps prevent the brown or olive tones that natural chlorophyll can develop during processing and storage.[^1]

## What foods contain Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins?
In the EU, E141 is authorised as a color in many food categories listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, including items such as confectionery, desserts, beverages, and processed vegetables.[^2]  
Common places you might see it on labels:
- Mint sauces and herb dressings
- Ice creams, sorbets, and dessert mixes
- Chewing gum and candies
- Canned peas or other processed greens
- Soft drinks and syrups

It may appear on labels as “E141,” “copper chlorophylls,” “copper chlorophyllins,” or specifically as [E141(i)](/e141i-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls){.additive} and [E141(ii)](/e141ii-copper-complexes-of-chlorophyllins){.additive}.

## What can replace Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins?
Several colors can be used depending on the shade and processing needs:
- Natural option: [chlorophylls](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins){.additive} (E140), though they are less stable in heat and acid
- Synthetic green: [Green S](/e142-green-s){.additive} (E142)
- Color blends: Yellow plus blue, for example [curcumin](/e100-curcumin){.additive} (E100) with [brilliant blue FCF](/e133-brilliant-blue-fcf){.additive}
- For non‑green shades, other families such as [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive} (browns) and [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins){.additive} (reds/purples) are common

## How is Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins made?
Both forms start with chlorophyll extracted from edible green plants. In E141(i), the magnesium at the center of the chlorophyll molecule is replaced by copper, producing fat‑soluble copper chlorophylls. In E141(ii), the chlorophyll is first saponified (the side chain is removed), then complexed with copper and neutralized to yield water‑soluble salts often called sodium copper chlorophyllins.[^3]  
EU specifications define identity, permitted starting materials, and purity requirements for both forms.[^3]

## Is Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins safe to eat?
EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) re‑evaluated E141 and concluded there is no safety concern for its use as a food color at the reported levels of use.[^1] In the EU, strict specifications limit copper content and control impurities such as heavy metals to help ensure product safety and consistency.[^3]  
Copper is an essential nutrient, but total intake from all sources matters. The small amounts contributed by E141 in foods are typically minor compared with dietary copper from foods like grains, nuts, and organ meats.[^4]

## Does Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins have any benefits?
E141’s role is cosmetic: it restores or standardizes green color in foods. It does not add flavor, and it is not intended to provide nutrition or health benefits.[^2]

## Who should avoid Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins?
- People with Wilson disease (a genetic disorder that causes copper to build up in the body) should avoid extra copper exposure and follow medical advice, which can include limiting copper intake.[^5]
- Anyone told by their healthcare provider to restrict copper should review labels and choose products accordingly.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: E141 is the same as plain chlorophyll. Fact: It is a copper‑stabilized form; that’s why it keeps a brighter green in processed foods.
- Myth: It’s always synthetic. Fact: The starting chlorophyll comes from plants; the copper complexing step makes it more stable for food use.
- Myth: It gives foods a metallic taste. Fact: At permitted levels, E141 is used for color and does not add noticeable flavor.

## Copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins in branded foods
Look for “E141,” “copper chlorophylls,” or “copper chlorophyllins” on ingredient lists. Large and small brands may use it in green candies, gums, sauces, processed vegetables, and drinks, depending on local regulations and the shade they want. If you are avoiding the additive, check the label every time, as recipes can change.
