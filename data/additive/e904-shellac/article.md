Shellac (E904) is a food-grade glaze that gives candies, nuts, and some fruits a smooth, shiny finish. It is a purified natural resin made from the secretions of the lac insect and is approved in many regions as a surface treatment for foods.

## At a glance
- E-number: E904; a glazing agent used to provide shine and protect surfaces
- Source: Natural resin from the lac insect (Kerria lacca); refined for food use
- Typical foods: Panned candies, chocolate dragées, coated nuts, and waxed fruit skins
- Function: Helps prevent moisture loss and scuffing; improves gloss
- Regulations: Specified in EU rules and listed by the U.S. FDA under permitted uses

## Why is Shellac added to food?
Shellac forms a thin, hard, and glossy film that protects delicate surfaces, reduces stickiness, and limits moisture transfer. This helps candies and coated nuts keep their shape and shine, and can slow down moisture loss from fresh produce and certain confections.[^2]

## What foods contain Shellac?
You’ll most often find shellac on the outside of panned or dragée-style confectionery (such as chocolate lentils), on coated nuts, and on some fresh fruits where a surface treatment is allowed. In the European Union, E904 is authorized as a glazing agent for specific food categories listed in the Union list of additives, including certain confectionery and fruit coatings.[^2]

## What can replace Shellac?
Alternatives depend on the product and the level of gloss needed.
- Plant waxes: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive}, [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}
- Other waxes: [white and yellow beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax){.additive}, [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax){.additive}
- Film-formers and glazes: [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan){.additive}, [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum){.additive}

These may give different levels of shine, hardness, and moisture protection, so formulators choose based on the food and desired finish.

## How is Shellac made?
Food-grade shellac is the purified product obtained from the resinous secretions of the lac insect (Kerria lacca). The raw material collected from host tree branches is cleaned to remove bark, color bodies, and most wax, then refined into flakes or solutions suitable for glazing foods.[^1][^5]

## Is Shellac safe to eat?
In the EU, shellac (E904) is included in the Union list of permitted food additives and has detailed identity and purity specifications, reflecting its accepted use as a glazing agent.[^2][^1] In the United States, shellac appears on the FDA Food Additive Status List and in the Code of Federal Regulations for certain coatings that come into contact with food, indicating it is permitted for specified uses.[^3][^4]

## Does Shellac have any benefits?
Beyond a high-gloss finish, shellac can help:
- Reduce moisture loss from coated foods
- Improve abrasion resistance and reduce scuffing during packaging and transport
- Provide a smoother eating experience by cutting stickiness on surfaces

These functional benefits are why it is common on polished confections and some produce.[^2]

## Who should avoid Shellac?
- People who avoid animal- or insect-derived ingredients (for example, vegans) may choose to avoid shellac because it originates from the lac insect.[^1]
- Those following strict dietary or ethical guidelines can opt for plant-wax coatings such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax){.additive} or [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax){.additive}.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Shellac is a plastic. Fact: It is a natural resin refined from lac insect secretions.[^1][^5]
- Myth: Shellac makes foods “waterproof.” Fact: It reduces moisture transfer but does not create a perfect barrier; performance depends on the food and coating level.[^2]
- Myth: Shellac is only used on candy. Fact: It is also permitted as a surface treatment on some fruits and other foods where regulations allow.[^2]

## Shellac in branded foods
You may see shellac listed as “shellac,” “confectioner’s glaze,” or “resinous glaze” on ingredient labels for:
- Shiny chocolate dragées and sugar-coated candies
- Polished roasted nuts
- Certain coated or waxed fruits (where allowed)
- Specialty bakery decorations that need a glossy, scuff-resistant finish
