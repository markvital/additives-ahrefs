Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E214), also called ethylparaben, is a preservative from the paraben family. It helps stop molds and some bacteria from growing, which can extend the shelf life of certain foods. In the European Union, E214 is no longer authorized as a food additive, so you should not see it on EU food labels.

## At a glance
- Name on label: Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate, ethylparaben, E214
- What it does: Preservative that slows spoilage by inhibiting microorganisms
- Additive family: Parabens (esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid)
- Typical form: White, crystalline solid; used in very small amounts
- Regulatory note: Not authorized as a food additive in the EU

## Why is Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate added to food?
Manufacturers use E214 to help prevent molds and some bacteria from growing, which can keep foods fresher for longer and reduce waste.^[EFSA Opinion on p‑hydroxybenzoates (E 214–219) as food additives. https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/83][^1] This antimicrobial effect is why parabens have been considered for a range of processed foods where microbial spoilage is a concern.[^1]

## What foods contain Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Availability varies by country. In places where E214 is permitted, you may find it in some processed foods such as baked goods, desserts, sauces, or beverages—always check the ingredient list for “ethylparaben,” “ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate,” or “E214.” In the European Union, E214 is not on the current Union list of authorized food additives, so it should not appear on EU food labels.[^2][^3]

## What can replace Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
Depending on the recipe and local rules, food makers may use:
- Sorbates such as [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- Benzoates such as [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- Propionates such as [calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate)
- Process and packaging controls (for example, heat treatment, pH control with acids like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), or modified-atmosphere packaging)

The best substitute depends on the food’s pH, moisture, flavor profile, and the types of microbes likely to grow.

## How is Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate made?
Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate is the ethyl ester of p‑hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA).^[Ethylparaben — PubChem (NIH). https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylparaben][^4] Paraben esters like E214 are typically produced by esterifying PHBA with the matching alcohol (here, ethanol), then purifying the product to meet food-additive specifications.[^1]

## Is Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate safe to eat?
Safety depends on both the dose and the rules where you live. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated parabens used as food additives and considered their antimicrobial use at controlled levels, based on available data at the time.[^1] However, the European Union later removed E214 (and related parabens) from the list of authorized food additives, so they are not permitted in EU foods today.[^2][^3]

Outside the EU, regulations can differ. Always follow local guidance and check product labels.

## Does Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate have any benefits?
- Helps keep foods safe for longer by slowing the growth of molds and some bacteria
- Can reduce food waste by extending shelf life
- May help maintain taste and texture by avoiding spoilage

These benefits only apply when the additive is allowed and used within legal limits for a given market.

## Who should avoid Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate?
- Consumers in the EU will not find E214 in compliant foods, since it is not authorized there.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to avoid parabens should check labels for “ethylparaben,” “ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate,” or “E214.”
- People who prefer paraben‑free products for personal reasons can choose alternatives that use other preservatives or different processing methods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: E214 is banned everywhere.
  Fact: It is not authorized in the EU, but regulations vary by country.
- Myth: All preservatives are alike.
  Fact: Preservatives work in different ways; for example, [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) is most effective against molds and yeasts, while [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) works best in acidic foods.
- Myth: If a label lists E214, it must be unsafe.
  Fact: Safety depends on the dose and local regulations; countries set their own rules for if and how it can be used.

## Ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate in branded foods
If allowed in your country, you might see it on labels as “ethylparaben,” “ethyl p‑hydroxybenzoate,” or “E214.” In the EU, compliant labels should not list E214. For similar preservative roles, brands may instead use [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate), or other approved options, depending on the product style and regulations.
