Sucrose esters of fatty acids (E473) are emulsifiers made from table sugar and edible fats. They help oil and water mix, keep foams stable, and improve the texture of many foods. You’ll see them in small amounts across bakery, dairy alternatives, confectionery, and drinks.

## At a glance
- What it is: an emulsifier and stabiliser made by joining sucrose (table sugar) with edible fatty acids.
- What it does: helps oil and water mix, stabilises foams and emulsions, controls sugar crystallisation, and improves mouthfeel.
- Where it’s used: bakery creams and fillings, coffee whiteners, whipped toppings, sauces, confectionery, and some beverages.
- What it’s called on labels: “E473” or “sucrose esters of fatty acids.”
- Diet notes: typically produced from plant oils; check with manufacturers if you avoid animal-derived ingredients.
- Regulation: authorised in the EU with specifications and purity criteria; uses and maximum levels are set by law.[^1][^2]

## Why is sucrose esters of fatty acids added to food?
Food makers use E473 to keep mixtures smooth and stable. It helps oil and water stay blended (emulsifies), improves whipping and foaming in creams and toppings, and can reduce sugar crystallisation in sweets so textures stay soft. It also fine-tunes mouthfeel in low‑fat products and helps disperse flavors evenly.[^1]

E473 performs similar roles to other emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), and certain polysorbates like [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate) and [polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate).

## What foods contain sucrose esters of fatty acids?
You’re most likely to find E473 in:
- Non‑dairy creamers and coffee whiteners
- Whipped toppings and dessert foams
- Bakery creams, icings, and filled biscuits
- Confectionery, caramels, and toffees
- Dressings, sauces, and spreads
- Powdered drink mixes and some ready‑to‑drink beverages

In the EU, permitted foods and any maximum use levels are listed in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and its updates.[^2]

## What can replace sucrose esters of fatty acids?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- General emulsifying: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [polyglycerol esters of fatty acids](/e475-polyglycerol-esters-of-fatty-acids)
- High‑strength emulsions or beverage systems: polysorbates such as [E432](/e432-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monolaurate) and [E433](/e433-polyoxyethylene-sorbitan-monooleate), or weighting/aid agents like [sucrose acetate isobutyrate](/e444-sucrose-acetate-isobutyrate)
- Aeration and whipping: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), certain [E471](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) blends

## How is sucrose esters of fatty acids made?
E473 is produced by reacting sucrose with edible fatty acids from food fats and oils. Manufacturers typically use esterification of sucrose with the fatty acids, or transesterification of sucrose with fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters. The result is a mixture of sucrose mono‑, di‑, and higher esters whose properties depend on the fatty acid types and the degree of substitution. Quality and purity criteria, including allowable raw materials and reaction routes, are set in EU specifications.[^1]

## Is sucrose esters of fatty acids safe to eat?
Yes—when used as authorised. In the European Union, E473 is permitted in many foods under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, and it must meet the purity and identity criteria in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2][^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated sucrose esters of fatty acids as part of its food additives re‑evaluation program, considering composition, metabolism, exposure, and toxicology.[^3]

## Does sucrose esters of fatty acids have any benefits?
E473 doesn’t add nutrition, but it offers useful technical benefits:
- Makes emulsions stable and sauces smooth
- Improves whipping/foaming in toppings and desserts
- Helps control sugar crystallisation in confectionery
- Enhances texture and mouthfeel in reduced‑fat foods

These effects can reduce defects like oiling‑off, grainy textures, or foam collapse.

## Who should avoid sucrose esters of fatty acids?
- Vegans and vegetarians who avoid animal‑derived inputs may wish to confirm the source of the fatty acids (many producers use plant oils, but regulations allow food fats and oils generally).[^1]
- People who prefer to limit emulsifiers for personal dietary reasons can check labels for “E473” or “sucrose esters of fatty acids.”

There are no common allergen concerns associated with E473 at authorised uses and purity levels.[^3]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s a sweetener. Fact: Despite the sucrose backbone, E473 is a functional emulsifier and is used at very low levels; it doesn’t sweeten foods.
- Myth: It’s the same as “sucrose polyester” fat replacers. Fact: E473 is mostly mono‑ and di‑esters used in tiny amounts as an emulsifier, not a bulk fat substitute.
- Myth: It always comes from animal fat. Fact: It can be made from various edible fats and oils; many commercial grades are plant‑derived, but check with the manufacturer if this matters to you.[^1]

## Sucrose esters of fatty acids in branded foods
You can spot it on ingredient lists as “sucrose esters of fatty acids” or “E473.” It appears across many everyday products—coffee whiteners, whipped toppings, certain chocolates and caramels, bakery creams, sauces, and some beverages—usually far down the list because only small amounts are needed.
