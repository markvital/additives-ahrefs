Azodicarbonamide and carbamide are two different compounds grouped under E927. Azodicarbonamide is a flour treatment agent used to condition dough, while carbamide—better known as urea—is approved as a food additive in certain uses such as chewing gum in some regions. Both have clear regulatory limits and specifications that guide their safe use.

## At a glance
- What it is: A pair of additives—azodicarbonamide (ADA) and carbamide (urea)—listed together as E927.
- What it does: ADA conditions and matures flour; urea is used for texture or glazing in specific products like chewing gum.
- Where it’s found: Breads and rolls (ADA, where allowed); certain gums and confectionery (urea).
- Label names: “Azodicarbonamide,” “ADA,” “carbamide,” or “urea.”
- Regulatory notes: ADA has a strict maximum use level in U.S. flour; urea is regulated with food-grade specifications and good manufacturing practice limits.

## Why is Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide added to food?
These two substances do different jobs:
- Azodicarbonamide (ADA) helps strengthen and condition dough. Bakers use it to improve dough handling and get consistent loaf volume and crumb structure. In the United States, it’s permitted in flour at very low levels, with a clear maximum limit set by regulation.[^1]
- Carbamide (urea) is used in select products—most often chewing gum—for texture, glazing, or to help manage stickiness, following food-grade specifications and good manufacturing practice (GMP).[^3][^4]

## What foods contain Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide?
- Baked goods and flour-based items: ADA may be present in flours used for breads, rolls, and similar bakery products where regulations allow its use.[^2]
- Chewing gum and certain confectionery: Urea can be used for glazing or to help keep gum soft and smooth, as permitted by applicable regulations and specifications.[^3][^4]

On an ingredient list, look for “azodicarbonamide” or “ADA” for E927a, and “urea” or “carbamide” for E927b.

## What can replace Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide?
- Dough strength and consistency: Bakers often turn to alternatives such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid), enzyme systems like [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase), [lecithins](/e322-lecithins), or emulsifiers such as [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [DATEM](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids). In some applications, flour treatment agents like [calcium peroxide](/e930-calcium-peroxide) or [potassium bromate](/e924a-potassium-bromate) are used where legally permitted.
- Gum glazing or softness: Humectants and polyols such as [glycerol](/e422-glycerol), [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol), [xylitol](/e967-xylitol), or [mannitol](/e421-mannitol) are common options.

## How is Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide made?
Food-grade ADA and urea must meet identity and purity specifications set by regulators:
- Azodicarbonamide is listed in U.S. regulation with defined identity and use limits for flour treatment.[^1]
- Urea (carbamide) is also listed in U.S. regulation as a direct food substance affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) when used in line with GMP, and in the EU with compositional specifications for food-additive quality.[^3][^4]

Manufacturers follow these specifications so the ingredients are suitable for food use.

## Is Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide safe to eat?
Safety depends on following strict rules:
- Azodicarbonamide: In the U.S., ADA is permitted as a flour treatment agent at levels not to exceed 45 parts per million (ppm) in flour, a limit set to ensure safety and performance.[^1] U.S. standards for “bleached flour” list ADA among authorized bleaching and maturing agents when used within the regulation.[^2]
- Carbamide (urea): In the U.S., urea is affirmed as GRAS as a direct food substance when used under current good manufacturing practice.[^3] In the EU, urea (E 927b) has EU food-additive specifications that define its food-grade quality.[^4]

Consumers who wish to avoid either substance can check ingredient lists; both must appear by name where used.

## Does Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide have any benefits?
- In baking, ADA helps deliver reliable dough handling, loaf volume, and crumb uniformity—important for consistent bakery products.[^1]
- In chewing gum, urea can help keep the texture smooth and reduce stickiness on the surface, supporting a pleasant chew.[^4]

## Who should avoid Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide?
- People who prefer minimal-ingredient or additive-free foods may choose breads made without ADA and gums made without added urea.
- If your healthcare provider has advised limiting specific additives, check labels for “azodicarbonamide/ADA” or “urea/carbamide.”

## Myths & facts
- “ADA is a ‘yoga mat chemical,’ so it must be unsafe.” Fact: The safety of a food additive depends on dose and quality. ADA has a specific legal limit in U.S. flour (not more than 45 ppm) and must meet food-grade specs.[^1]
- “Urea isn’t a real food ingredient.” Fact: Food-grade urea is a regulated additive in several jurisdictions, with defined specifications and GMP-based use.[^3][^4]
- “If it’s allowed once, it’s allowed everywhere.” Fact: Approvals and maximum levels can differ by country. Always check local regulations and labels.

## Azodicarbonamide and Carbamide in branded foods
Brand use changes over time, and recipes vary by country. To spot E927 ingredients:
- For baked goods, scan flour and dough conditioner lines for “azodicarbonamide” or “ADA.”
- For chewing gum and some confectionery, look for “urea” or “carbamide.”
- Some labels also include E-numbers, such as “E927a” (ADA) or “E927b” (urea), depending on local rules.
