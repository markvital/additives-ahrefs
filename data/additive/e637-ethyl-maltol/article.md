Ethyl maltol (E637) is a flavoring and flavor enhancer that adds a warm, caramelized taste and aroma to foods. It is used in very small amounts to round out sweetness and make flavors taste fuller and more balanced.

## At a glance
Here is a quick overview of what E637 does and where you might find it.
- Role: flavoring/flavor enhancer with a caramelized sugar, cotton-candy-like note.
- Also called: E637, ethyl maltol, 2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one.
- Typical uses: candies, chocolate, baked goods, ice creams, flavored drinks, and syrups.
- How it appears on labels: “ethyl maltol” or “flavoring.”
- Use level: tiny amounts under good manufacturing practice.

## Why is Ethyl maltol added to food?
Food makers add ethyl maltol to boost sweetness perception, add a caramel-like note, and smooth out sharp edges in flavor. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits ethyl maltol as a synthetic flavoring substance at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.[^1] Its aroma is often described as warm, sweet, and cotton-candy-like, and its chemical name is 2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one.[^2]

## What foods contain Ethyl maltol?
You may see ethyl maltol on the labels of:
- Confectionery: caramels, toffees, chocolates, fudge
- Baked goods: cookies, cakes, pastries
- Dairy desserts: ice cream, flavored yogurt, custards
- Beverages and syrups: flavored milks, coffee syrups, soft drinks
- Savory items with sweet notes: sauces and glazes

Not every brand uses it, but when it is added, it is listed in the ingredient statement as “ethyl maltol” or simply included under “flavor.”

## What can replace Ethyl maltol?
Alternatives depend on the goal:
- Similar flavor note: [maltol](/e636-maltol){.additive} provides a related, toasty-caramel character.
- More sweetness (without calories): high-intensity sweeteners such as [sucralose](/e955-sucralose){.additive} or [steviol glycosides](/e960-steviol-glycosides){.additive} can lift sweetness, though they do not copy ethyl maltol’s aroma.
- More caramel color and some flavor depth: [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive} can deepen color and add mild burnt-sugar notes.
- For tart balance alongside sweetness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} can sharpen fruit flavors while ethyl maltol-like notes provide roundness.

## How is Ethyl maltol made?
Food-grade ethyl maltol is produced by chemical synthesis and supplied as a pure ingredient for use in very small amounts. Manufacturers follow food-quality specifications and good manufacturing practice so the material meets purity, identity, and safety expectations for flavorings.

## Is Ethyl maltol safe to eat?
When used as intended, ethyl maltol is considered safe by major regulators. In the U.S., FDA lists ethyl maltol among synthetic flavoring substances permitted in food under good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, flavorings in general (including substances like ethyl maltol) are regulated under Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008, which sets safety and purity requirements for flavorings placed on the market.[^3]

## Does Ethyl maltol have any benefits?
Ethyl maltol does not add nutrition, but it can:
- Enhance and round out sweetness perception
- Add a caramelized, cooked-sugar aroma
- Improve the overall flavor balance so products taste richer and more appealing

## Who should avoid Ethyl maltol?
Most people do not need to avoid ethyl maltol at the tiny levels used in foods. Anyone following a physician-advised elimination diet or avoiding added flavors for personal reasons can choose products labeled “no added flavors” or “minimally processed.”

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Ethyl maltol is a sugar. Fact: It is a flavoring; it boosts sweet aroma but does not provide sugar or calories.
- Myth: It is used in large amounts. Fact: It is effective at very low levels, typically a few parts per million.
- Myth: It hides spoiled food. Fact: It fine-tunes flavor; it does not preserve food or make unsafe food safe.

## Ethyl maltol in branded foods
On retail shelves, ethyl maltol most often appears in ingredient lists for candies, chocolate bars, ice creams, flavored dairy drinks, cookies, breakfast pastries, and some ready-to-drink coffees or teas. Look for “ethyl maltol” or “natural and artificial flavor” (when present as part of a flavor blend).
