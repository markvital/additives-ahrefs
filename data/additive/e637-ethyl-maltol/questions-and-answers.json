      "q": "how much ethyl maltol",

      "q": "ejuice ethyl maltol how much",
      "a": "Use only tiny amounts; many formulators add about 0.25–1% of a 10% ethyl maltol-in-propylene glycol solution (roughly 0.025–0.1% EM, or ~250–1000 ppm), as higher levels can mute flavors.",

    {
      "q": "ejuice how to use ethyl maltol",
      "a": "Dissolve it in propylene glycol to make ~10% solution, then add sparingly to the flavor base and adjust after steeping; start very low because too much can flatten flavors.",

    {
      "q": "how much ethyl maltol in e liquid",
      "a": "Typically 0.025–0.1% ethyl maltol by weight (e.g., 0.25–1% of a 10% solution) is enough for e-liquids; exceeding this often mutes or overly candies the mix.",
