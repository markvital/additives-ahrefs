Non-amidated pectines (E440i) are gelling fibers taken from fruit peels, mainly citrus and apples. They act as thickeners, stabilisers, and sometimes emulsifiers, helping jams set, sauces hold together, and drinks stay uniform. They are widely used and long considered safe when used as intended.

## At a glance
- What it is: Fruit-derived soluble fiber used as a thickener, stabiliser, and gelling agent  
- Where it comes from: Extracted from citrus peels and apple pomace  
- Common in: Jams, jellies, marmalades, fruit fillings, yoghurt and dairy drinks, sauces, and confectionery  
- Diets: Plant-based and gluten-free; typically suitable for vegetarians and vegans  
- Label names: “Pectin,” “Pectins,” “E440i,” or “Non-amidated pectines”  
- Regulation: Listed in the EU as E440(i); considered GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the U.S. FDA when used within good manufacturing practice  

## Why is non-amidated pectines added to food?
Pectin creates body and gel structure. In high-sugar, acidic recipes like jams and jellies, it forms a firm gel that sets the product and helps it slice or spread cleanly.[^2] In low-sugar systems, certain non-amidated pectins with a lower degree of esterification can gel in the presence of calcium, helping reduced-sugar or no-added-sugar recipes hold together.[^2] It also stabilises particles in fruit drinks and dairy, prevents watery separation (syneresis), and improves mouthfeel.[^2]

## What foods contain non-amidated pectines?
You’ll most often find it in fruit preserves (jams, jellies, marmalades), sweet bakery fillings, fruit preparations for yoghurt, drinking yoghurts, juice drinks and nectars, fruit snacks, and some confectionery gels.[^2] Many sauces and dessert toppings also use pectin to control thickness and prevent separation.[^2]

## What can replace non-amidated pectines?
Many hydrocolloids can stand in, depending on the recipe:
- For firm, sliceable gels: [agar](/e406-agar){.additive} or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}
- For chewy gels: [gelatine](/e428-gelatine){.additive} in non-vegan products; [gellan gum](/e418-gellan-gum){.additive} for vegan
- For body and stability without a firm gel: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}, or [tara gum](/e417-tara-gum){.additive}

Keep in mind that swaps change texture and flavor release. Preserves may also need acid balance (for example, with [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive}) and sugar adjustments.

## How is non-amidated pectines made?
Manufacturers extract pectin from dried citrus peels or apple pomace using hot, mildly acidic water. The pectin is then filtered, purified, precipitated with food-grade alcohol (such as ethanol or isopropanol), washed, dried, and milled to a powder.[^3] Non-amidated pectins are not treated with ammonia, which distinguishes them from amidated pectins (E440ii).[^3] Production parameters are tuned to achieve different gel behaviors (for example, high- or low-methoxyl grades).[^2]

## Is non-amidated pectines safe to eat?
In the United States, pectin is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as GRAS—Generally Recognized As Safe—when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1] In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated pectins (E440i, E440ii) and concluded they are not of safety concern at reported uses and use levels.[^2] As with other fibers, large amounts may cause gas or softer stools in some people.[^2]

## Does non-amidated pectines have any benefits?
Technologically, pectin gives reliable gelation, improves texture, and limits watery separation in foods. Nutritionally, pectin is a soluble dietary fiber found in plants, contributing to overall fiber intake.[^4] While it is not used as a vitamin or mineral source, its fiber nature can help adjust the texture and fiber profile of foods.

## Who should avoid non-amidated pectines?
- People on a medically prescribed low-fiber diet should check with their healthcare professional before choosing high-pectin foods.
- Individuals with sensitive digestion may wish to introduce high-pectin products gradually.
- For infant and special medical foods, always follow product directions and medical advice, as rules for these products can differ from those for general foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Pectin is the same as gelatin.”  
  Fact: Pectin is plant-based fiber; gelatin is animal protein. They gel differently and suit different diets.
- Myth: “E-numbers mean a food is unsafe.”  
  Fact: An E-number means the additive was evaluated for use in the EU. E440(i) refers to pectins that meet EU specifications.[^3]
- Myth: “All pectins are the same.”  
  Fact: Non-amidated pectins (E440i) differ from [amidated pectin](/e440b-pectin-amide){.additive} (E440ii) in how they’re processed and how they gel.[^3]

## E440I in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “pectin,” “pectins,” or “E440i.” You’ll commonly see it on jars of jam and marmalade, yoghurt fruit layers and drinkable yoghurts, fruit spreads, bakery fruit fillings, and some soft candies. Texture can vary by brand because pectin grade, sugar level, and acidity all affect the final set.
