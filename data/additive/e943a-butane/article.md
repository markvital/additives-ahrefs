Butane (E943a) is a food-grade liquefied gas used mainly as a propellant in aerosol products like whipped cream and cooking sprays. It flashes off quickly after dispensing, so only tiny amounts, if any, remain in the food under normal use. Regulators in the EU and U.S. allow its use when it meets strict purity rules.

## At a glance
- E-number: E943a; function: propellant gas
- Typical uses: aerosol whipped cream, spray oils, pan-release sprays
- Highly volatile and flammable; evaporates rapidly after spraying
- Allowed in the EU and U.S. when food-grade purity specifications are met
- Not a nutrient or flavor; it provides pressure to expel the food
- Also allowed in the EU as an extraction solvent under restrictions

## Why is Butane added to food?
Butane is added to foods to act as a propellant in aerosol cans. It provides pressure that pushes the product through a nozzle to create a fine, even spray or foam. Because butane is a very volatile, liquefied gas, it evaporates quickly as the food leaves the can, leaving the product behind with little to no residue.[^7]

## What foods contain Butane?
You are most likely to find butane listed as “propellant: butane” on:
- Aerosol whipped creams and dessert toppings
- Cooking sprays and oil mists
- Bakery pan-release sprays

In the European Union, butane (E943a) is authorised as a food additive for use as a propellant in specific food categories under the food additives regulation.[^3] It is also permitted in the EU as an extraction solvent (for example, in making some flavourings), with conditions and residue limits set by law.[^6]

## What can replace Butane?
- Other food-grade propellants: [propane](/e944-propane){.additive}, [isobutane](/e943b-isobutane){.additive}, [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide){.additive}, [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide){.additive}, and [nitrogen](/e941-nitrogen){.additive}
- Non-aerosol options: pump sprays, squeeze bottles, brush-on oils, or wipe-on release agents

## How is Butane made?
Most butane comes from processing natural gas and from crude oil refining. It is separated from other natural gas liquids and refined by fractionation to reach the desired purity.[^5] Food-grade butane must meet identity and purity specifications, including strict limits on contaminants such as sulfur compounds, set out in EU additive specifications.[^2]

## Is Butane safe to eat?
Based on a comprehensive review, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded there is no safety concern for butane (E943a), isobutane (E943b), and propane (E944) at their current uses and exposure levels, and established an “ADI not specified” (acceptable daily intake not specified), indicating low toxicity at intended uses.[^1] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists food-grade butane among substances permitted for use in food (such as propellants) under specified conditions.[^4] Because butane is highly volatile, residual amounts in dispensed foods are expected to be very low when products are used as directed.[^1]

Note: Butane is extremely flammable; the safety issue for consumers is fire risk from the can and spray, not toxicity from normal dietary exposure.[^7]

## Does Butane have any benefits?
- Creates a uniform spray or foam for consistent portioning and texture
- Helps deliver whipped creams and toppings with the right lightness
- Enables mess-free pan release and controlled oil application

## Who should avoid Butane?
- People who avoid aerosol products in general may prefer non-aerosol formats.
- Anyone using aerosol products near open flames or heat sources should avoid them because butane is highly flammable.[^7]
- If you are sensitive to aerosols or propellants, choose pump sprays or bottled alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Butane in food is the same as lighter fluid, so it’s unsafe.” Fact: Food-grade butane is highly purified and must meet strict additive specifications before use.[^2]
- Myth: “Most of the butane stays in the food.” Fact: As a volatile propellant, butane rapidly evaporates as the product leaves the can, leaving little to no residue under normal use.[^1][^7]
- Myth: “Using butane as a solvent isn’t allowed.” Fact: The EU allows butane as an extraction solvent with conditions and residue limits set by law.[^6]
- Myth: “Butane adds flavor.” Fact: It is inert in this context and used only to propel or extract; it does not contribute taste.

## Butane in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for wording like “propellant (butane)” or “propellant: butane, propane.” Many aerosol whipped creams and cooking sprays use butane alone or in blends with [propane](/e944-propane){.additive} or [isobutane](/e943b-isobutane){.additive}. If you prefer to avoid propellants entirely, choose pump sprays or pourable products instead.
