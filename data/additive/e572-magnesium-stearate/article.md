Magnesium stearate (E572) is a white, waxy powder used in tiny amounts to keep foods and supplements free-flowing and to stop tablets from sticking to equipment. It is the magnesium salt of common food fatty acids and is widely approved by regulators in both the U.S. and the EU for use at good manufacturing practice levels. It does not add taste or color and has no meaningful nutritional effect.

## At a glance
- E-number: E572; also called magnesium stearate
- What it does: anti-caking agent, flow aid, and release agent in powders and tablets
- Where it’s found: powdered mixes, seasonings, confectionery tablets, and dietary supplements
- Source: made from edible fatty acids (often stearic and palmitic acids) combined with a magnesium source; can be of vegetable or animal origin
- Appearance: fine, white, water-insoluble powder
- Regulatory status: permitted in the U.S. as GRAS when used under current good manufacturing practice; EU specifications are defined in additive legislation

## Why is Magnesium stearate added to food?
Manufacturers add magnesium stearate to help powders pour evenly, prevent clumping, and keep tablets from sticking to molds and punches during compression. These “anti-caking” and “release” functions help products stay consistent in size, shape, and texture, especially at large scale.[^1][^2]

## What foods contain Magnesium stearate?
You’re most likely to see magnesium stearate on the ingredient lists of dry or compressed products where flow and release matter, such as powdered drink mixes and spices, pressed mints and candies, and many dietary supplements in tablet or capsule form.[^1][^3] It is almost always listed near the end of the ingredient list because it is used in very small amounts.

## What can replace Magnesium stearate?
Depending on the recipe and equipment, formulators may use:
- Other flow/anti-caking agents such as [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide){.additive} or [talc](/e553b-talc){.additive}
- Related salts of fatty acids like [magnesium salts of fatty acids](/e470b-magnesium-salts-of-fatty-acids){.additive} or the group of [sodium, potassium and calcium salts of fatty acids](/e470a-sodium-potassium-and-calcium-salts-of-fatty-acids){.additive}
- Lubricants and processing aids such as [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}
- Fillers and carriers like [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive} or [microcrystalline cellulose](/e460i-microcrystalline-cellulose){.additive}

The choice depends on the product’s texture, taste neutrality, labeling goals, and how it behaves on specific machinery.

## How is Magnesium stearate made?
Magnesium stearate is produced by reacting edible fatty acids—primarily stearic acid, often with some palmitic acid—with a magnesium source (such as magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide), then purifying and drying the product.[^2] By definition it consists mainly of the magnesium salt of stearic acid, with smaller amounts of the magnesium salt of palmitic acid, and appears as a fine, white, water-insoluble powder.[^1][^3]

## Is Magnesium stearate safe to eat?
In the United States, magnesium stearate is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for direct addition to food when used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice (no specific maximum limit is set beyond that standard).[^1] In the European Union, it is an authorized food additive with established identity and purity criteria set in law.[^2]

## Does Magnesium stearate have any benefits?
Its benefits are technological: it helps powders flow, keeps mixes from clumping, and makes tablet manufacturing reliable. Although it contains magnesium, it is used at such low levels that it is not a meaningful source of dietary magnesium.

## Who should avoid Magnesium stearate?
- People who avoid animal-derived ingredients for dietary or religious reasons should check with the manufacturer, since the fatty acid source may be from vegetable oils or animal fat; many products specify “vegetable magnesium stearate.”[^2]
- Anyone under medical advice to manage magnesium intake should consult a healthcare professional. The amounts used in foods are very small, but personal guidance is best.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Magnesium stearate is unsafe.” Fact: It is permitted as a food additive in the U.S. and EU, with identity and purity criteria and use limited to good manufacturing practice.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “It’s always animal-based.” Fact: Regulations allow production from vegetable or animal fatty acids; sourcing depends on the manufacturer and can be verified on request or on the label.[^2]
- Myth: “It dissolves in foods and changes taste.” Fact: Magnesium stearate is essentially insoluble in water and used at very low levels, so it does not contribute flavor.[^3]

## Magnesium stearate in branded foods
On labels, look for “magnesium stearate” or “E572.” Because it is a processing aid used in small amounts, it often appears near the end of the ingredient list on powdered products and compressed confectionery, as well as many dietary supplements.
