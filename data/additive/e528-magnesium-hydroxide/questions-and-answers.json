      "q": "how magnesium hydroxide works",
      "a": "It works as a sparingly soluble base that releases hydroxide ions to neutralize acids and raise pH. In medicinal use it neutralizes gastric acid and, at higher doses, draws water into the intestines to promote bowel movements.",

      "q": "is magnesium hydroxide a strong base",
      "a": "Chemically it’s a strong base, but its very low solubility means its aqueous solutions are only moderately alkaline compared with highly soluble bases like sodium hydroxide.",

      "q": "what is magnesium hydroxide used for",
      "a": "In foods it’s used as an acidity regulator/alkalizing agent and processing aid to control pH. Outside foods it’s the active ingredient in some antacids (milk of magnesia) and osmotic laxatives.",

      "q": "what does magnesium hydroxide do",
      "a": "In food products it neutralizes excess acidity and helps stabilize pH. Medically it relieves heartburn by neutralizing stomach acid and, at higher doses, promotes bowel movements by drawing water into the gut.",
