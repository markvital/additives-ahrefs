Tripotassium citrate (E332ii) is the tripotassium salt of citric acid. Food makers use it to control acidity, keep flavors steady, and bind trace metals that can cause off-flavors and color changes.

## At a glance
- What it is: The tripotassium salt of [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), often written as “potassium citrate” on labels
- E-number: E332ii (part of the “potassium citrates” group E332)
- Main roles: Acidity regulator and buffer (keeps pH steady), sequestrant (binds metal ions), stabiliser
- Typical foods: Soft drinks, juices, sports drinks, jams and jellies, dairy drinks, processed cheeses, and candies
- Diet and origin: Generally vegan and gluten-free; made by neutralizing citric acid with potassium bases
- Taste impact: Softens sharp sourness and helps maintain a clean, consistent flavor

## Why is Tripotassium citrate added to food?
Manufacturers add tripotassium citrate to keep a stable, mildly acidic pH (it acts as a buffer), which helps protect flavor, color, and texture. It also works as a sequestrant—binding trace metals like iron and copper that can drive oxidation and browning—thereby improving shelf life and taste stability.[^1]

## What foods contain Tripotassium citrate?
You’ll most often see it in water‑based drinks (soft drinks, flavored waters, sports and energy drinks), fruit products (juices, jams, jellies), confectionery, dairy drinks, and certain processed cheese products. Many international standards list potassium citrates for use across a wide range of categories, especially beverages and fruit-based foods.[^2]

## What can replace Tripotassium citrate?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- For acidity control and buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [calcium citrates](/e333-calcium-citrates)
- For buffering with less sodium: potassium-based buffers such as [monopotassium phosphate](/e340i-monopotassium-phosphate) or [tripotassium phosphate](/e340iii-tripotassium-phosphate)
- For metal binding and stabilization: citrates as above, or phosphates such as [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- For pH adjustment in baking: [sodium bicarbonate](/e500ii-sodium-bicarbonate) or [sodium carbonates](/e500-sodium-carbonates), paired with an acid
- For slow acid release in certain foods: [glucono‑delta‑lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone)

## How is Tripotassium citrate made?
Tripotassium citrate is typically produced by neutralizing food‑grade [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with a potassium base, such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate. The solution is filtered, concentrated, and crystallized, then dried to yield the final food‑grade crystals or granules.[^3] This process is designed to meet international purity specifications for food additives.[^3]

## Is Tripotassium citrate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated citric acid and its salts, including potassium citrates (E332), and concluded there is no safety concern at reported use levels in foods. EFSA found that a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was not necessary for this group, based on available data and typical exposures.[^1]

## Does Tripotassium citrate have any benefits?
In foods, it helps keep flavors consistent by holding pH steady, reduces harsh sourness from acids, and can improve color and clarity in drinks. Using potassium citrate instead of sodium citrate can also support lower‑sodium formulations while providing similar functionality. As a potassium salt, it contributes a small amount of dietary potassium, though usually not enough to make a health claim on its own.

## Who should avoid Tripotassium citrate?
People who must limit potassium should be cautious. This includes individuals with kidney disease, those with high blood potassium (hyperkalemia), and people taking certain medicines (for example, potassium‑sparing diuretics or some blood‑pressure drugs such as ACE inhibitors), because extra potassium may be unsafe for them.[^4] If you have a medical condition or take these medicines, ask your healthcare provider before consuming products high in potassium salts.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s an artificial chemical.” Fact: Tripotassium citrate is simply the potassium salt of naturally occurring citric acid.
- Myth: “It makes foods alkaline.” Fact: It buffers acidity and helps hold foods at a controlled, mildly acidic pH.
- Myth: “It’s the same as MSG.” Fact: It’s unrelated to glutamates; it’s a citrate used mainly to regulate acidity and bind metals.

## Tripotassium citrate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “potassium citrate,” “tripotassium citrate,” or “E332(ii).” It is common in carbonated soft drinks, flavored waters, sports drinks, juice drinks, jams and jellies, some processed cheeses, dairy beverages, and candies. Levels vary by product and recipe, so appearance on the label does not necessarily mean a high amount.
