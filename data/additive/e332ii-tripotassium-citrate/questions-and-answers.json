      "q": "how long should you take potassium citrate for kidney stones",

      "q": "is potassium citrate good for you",

      "q": "can potassium citrate dissolve kidney stones",
      "a": "It can help dissolve uric acid stones (and sometimes cystine) by alkalinizing urine, but it does not dissolve calcium‑based stones; it also helps prevent new stones by raising urinary citrate.",

    {
      "q": "how much potassium citrate per day",
