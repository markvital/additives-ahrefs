Allura red (E129), also called FD&C Red No. 40, is a bright, water‑soluble synthetic dye that gives foods a red to orange‑red color. It is one of the most widely used food colors in the U.S. and Europe and appears in drinks, sweets, and many everyday packaged foods. Regulatory agencies allow it when used within rules that control purity and dose.

## At a glance
- What it is: A synthetic azo dye used as a color additive in foods and drinks
- Other names you’ll see: FD&C Red No. 40, Red 40, Allura Red AC, E129
- What it does: Provides a stable red hue; helps foods look consistent from batch to batch
- Common in: Soft drinks, candies, cereals, bakery items, gelatins, flavored dairy, and snack coatings
- Status: Authorized in the U.S. and EU; the EU requires a label note about possible effects on children’s behavior
- ADI: 7 mg per kg body weight per day (established by EFSA)

## Why is Allura red added to food?
Color helps us recognize flavors and freshness, and it sets expectations before we take a bite. Allura red is used because it dissolves well in water, holds its color in many recipes, and stays fairly stable during processing and storage. Manufacturers use it to replace color lost during cooking, standardize the look of seasonal crops, or create bright, fun shades in treats and drinks.

## What foods contain Allura red?
You’ll most often find Allura red in:
- Carbonated and still soft drinks, sports and energy drinks, and powdered beverages
- Confectionery such as gummies, hard candies, licorice, and coated sweets
- Breakfast cereals, cereal bars, and fruit‑flavored snacks
- Bakery icings, fillings, cupcakes, and cookies
- Gelatins, puddings, and frozen desserts
- Savory items like seasoned snack coatings and some sauces

Beyond foods, it can also appear in some dietary supplements and over‑the‑counter medicines.

## What can replace Allura red?
Substitutes depend on the product, pH, and whether the color needs to be water‑soluble or fat‑dispersible.

- Plant‑derived reds: [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive}, [anthocyanins](/e163-anthocyanins){.additive} (from berries/grapes), and [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract){.additive}
- Other approved colors: [ponceau 4R](/e124-ponceau-4r){.additive}, [carmoisine](/e122-azorubine){.additive}, and [sunset yellow FCF](/e110-sunset-yellow-fcf){.additive} (for orange shades)
- Brownish reds: [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive}
- Natural alternatives with similar use cases: [annatto](/e160b-annatto){.additive}

Each alternative behaves differently: for example, anthocyanins shift color with acidity, beet colors can fade with heat and light, and some natural colors can add flavor notes. Formulators pick based on the recipe and labeling goals.

## How is Allura red made?
Allura red is a synthetic “azo” dye, meaning it contains an azo bond (–N=N–) linking two aromatic rings. It is manufactured through controlled chemical reactions, purified to meet strict specifications, and then used as either the water‑soluble dye or as an “aluminum lake” form for oil‑based or low‑moisture foods. In the U.S., FD&C Red No. 40 and its aluminum lake are certified color additives listed by FDA for use in foods when they meet identity and purity criteria.^[1]

## Is Allura red safe to eat?
In the United States, FD&C Red No. 40 is a listed color additive in the Code of Federal Regulations and may be used in foods in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice, provided each batch is certified and meets the specifications.^[2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated Allura Red AC (E129) and set an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 7 mg per kg body weight per day.^[3]

In the EU, foods containing Allura red must carry the statement “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children,” a precautionary label required for a group of six colors that includes E129.^[4] Regulatory bodies continue to monitor new data, but current approvals allow its use within established limits.

## Does Allura red have any benefits?
Allura red does not add nutrition, but it provides practical benefits:
- Keeps color consistent across batches and seasons
- Restores color lost during processing
- Helps consumers recognize flavors (for example, “red” fruit flavors)
- Offers good stability in many beverage and confectionery systems

## Who should avoid Allura red?
- People who choose to avoid synthetic colors for personal or dietary reasons
- Caregivers who follow the EU precautionary label regarding possible effects on children’s behavior^[4]
- Individuals who have been advised by a healthcare professional to avoid certain color additives due to sensitivity

If you want to skip it, check the ingredient list and choose versions colored with alternatives such as [beetroot red](/e162-beetroot-red){.additive} or [caramel](/e150-caramel){.additive}.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Red 40 is banned in Europe.” Fact: Allura red (E129) is permitted in the EU, but products must include a specific warning about possible effects on children’s behavior.^[4]
- Myth: “Synthetic colors aren’t checked by regulators.” Fact: In the U.S., FD&C colors like Red 40 are subject to FDA batch certification and specification controls before use in food.^[1]
- Myth: “Red 40 always causes hyperactivity.” Fact: Authorities allow its use; the EU applies a precautionary label, while overall approvals reflect evaluations that do not establish a general causal effect for all children.^[3]

## Allura red in branded foods
On U.S. labels, look for “FD&C Red No. 40,” “Red 40,” or “Allura Red AC.” FDA rules require certified colors to be listed by their specific name.^[5] In the EU, look for “E129” or “Allura Red AC.” Some brands also use the “aluminum lake” form; it may appear as “Red 40 Lake” in icing, chocolate coatings, and tablets.
