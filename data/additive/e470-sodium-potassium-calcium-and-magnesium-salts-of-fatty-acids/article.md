Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids (E470) are a group of emulsifiers and stabilisers made from common food fatty acids joined to everyday minerals. They help fat and water mix, keep powders free‑flowing, and stop foods from sticking to equipment. You will find them in baked goods, confectionery, dairy analogues, and many powdered mixes.

## At a glance
- What it is: Mineral salts of edible fatty acids (for example, stearic and palmitic acids)
- E‑number: E470 (covers sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts)
- What it does: Emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, anti‑caking and release agent
- Common in: Bread and cakes, chocolate and confectionery, powdered drink mixes, instant sauces, seasonings, dairy and plant‑based spreads
- Typical label names: Calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, potassium stearate
- Source: Usually made from vegetable oils; animal fats can also be used
- Dietary notes: Tiny use levels; generally neutral in taste and color
- Regulation: Authorized in the EU with detailed purity specs; several individual salts are affirmed as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) in the U.S.

## Why is Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids added to food?
These salts help oil and water stay mixed, so foods keep a stable texture and don’t separate. They also make powders flow better, reduce clumping, and act as release agents so products don’t stick to pans or molds during processing. In the EU, E470 salts are listed as emulsifiers and stabilisers with defined purity criteria, reflecting these functions.[^1]

## What foods contain Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids?
You’ll most often see them in:
- Bakery: bread, buns, cakes, cookies, wafer sheets
- Confectionery and chocolate: coatings, fillings, molded pieces
- Powders: instant beverage mixes, dessert powders, gravy and sauce mixes, spice blends
- Fats and spreads: margarine and similar products
- Dairy and dairy analogues: processed cheeses and plant‑based alternatives
- Snack foods and cereal bars
They can also appear in glazing agents and as processing aids on equipment surfaces (release/lubrication).

## What can replace Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids?
Possible alternatives depend on the job they do:
- Emulsifying/texture: [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}, [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [sodium stearoyl-2‑lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}, [calcium stearoyl-2‑lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}
- Thickening/stabilising: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [cellulose](/e460-cellulose){.additive}
- Anti‑caking/flow: [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide){.additive}, [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate){.additive}

## How is Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids made?
Manufacturers start with edible fats and oils (plant or animal). These are split to obtain long‑chain fatty acids such as stearic and palmitic acids. The fatty acids are then neutralized with food‑grade sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium compounds to form their salts (for example, calcium stearate or magnesium stearate). The resulting materials are purified to meet official specifications for identity and purity laid down in EU law for E470a (sodium, potassium, and calcium salts of fatty acids) and E470b (magnesium salts of fatty acids).[^1]

## Is Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids safe to eat?
In the EU, E470 salts are authorized food additives with published purity criteria and are permitted for use in many food categories under the general food additives regulation.[^1][^3] In the U.S., several individual salts (for example, calcium stearate and magnesium stearate) are listed by FDA as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^2] These salts break down in the digestive system into fatty acids (which are common food nutrients) and minerals like sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium.

## Does Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids have any benefits?
For consumers, they help keep foods uniform, smooth, and easy to mix or pour. For manufacturers, they improve dough handling, reduce sticking, and keep powders free‑flowing. They don’t contribute meaningful flavor or color and provide negligible nutrition at typical use levels.

## Who should avoid Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids?
- People who prefer to avoid animal‑derived ingredients (vegans, certain religious diets) may wish to ask the maker about the fatty acid source, since both plant and animal fats can be used.
- Those on strict mineral‑restricted diets (for example, low‑sodium) should know that the amounts from this additive are very small compared to normal dietary sources.
- Individuals with highly specific sensitivities should consult a healthcare professional if unsure.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are artificial chemicals.” Fact: E‑numbers are simply codes for approved additives; these salts are made from common food fatty acids and everyday minerals.
- Myth: “Magnesium stearate blocks nutrient absorption.” Fact: Food‑use levels are very low, and regulators consider individual salts like magnesium stearate safe when used as intended.[^2]
- Myth: “These additives add trans fats.” Fact: They are salts of naturally occurring fatty acids, not hydrogenated trans fats.

## Sodium/potassium/calcium and magnesium salts of fatty acids in branded foods
On labels you might see “calcium stearate,” “magnesium stearate,” “sodium stearate,” or the group name “E470.” They appear widely across supermarket shelves: sliced bread and rolls, cake mixes, chocolate bars with fillings, instant drink and dessert mixes, margarine‑type spreads, processed cheese slices, and seasoning blends. If the source (plant vs. animal) matters to you, look for a note such as “vegetable source” or contact the manufacturer.
