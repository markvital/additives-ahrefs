Potassium gluconate (E577) is a food additive that helps control acidity and bind metal ions that could spoil taste or color. It is part of the gluconate family, made from glucose, and can also add a small amount of potassium to foods.

## At a glance
Potassium gluconate is a helper ingredient that keeps foods stable and tasting consistent.

- E-number: E577
- Main roles: sequestrant (binds metal ions) and acidity regulator
- Where you might see it: regulated uses in processed foods such as drinks and fruit or vegetable products
- How it’s made: glucose is fermented to gluconic acid, then neutralized with a potassium base
- Taste/texture: not used for flavor; used to maintain quality

## Why is potassium gluconate added to food?
Food makers use potassium gluconate to keep flavors, colors, and textures steady. It works by binding trace metals (sequestration) and helping to buffer acidity, which can improve shelf stability and product consistency.[^4]

## What foods contain potassium gluconate?
Potassium gluconate is an approved additive in the European Union, with uses set out in the food additives regulation. In practice, it may appear in certain beverages, fruit and vegetable products, and other processed foods where control of acidity or metal ions is needed; check ingredient lists for “potassium gluconate” or “E577.” The detailed permissions are listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.[^2]

## What can replace potassium gluconate?
Depending on the recipe goal, several additives can do a similar job.
- To regulate acidity or provide buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or [potassium citrates](/e332-potassium-citrates)
- To bind metal ions and protect flavor/color: [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates) or [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates)
- Within the same gluconate family (formulators may switch within limits): [glucono-delta-lactone](/e575-glucono-delta-lactone), [calcium gluconate](/e578-calcium-gluconate), or [iron gluconate](/e579-iron-gluconate)

## How is potassium gluconate made?
Manufacturers typically produce gluconic acid by fermenting glucose with safe, food-grade microorganisms or by enzyme-catalyzed oxidation. Potassium gluconate is then obtained by neutralizing gluconic acid with a potassium base (such as potassium hydroxide), followed by purification and drying.[^1] Its identity and purity are described in EU specifications for E-numbered additives.[^4]

## Is potassium gluconate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated gluconic acid and its salts, including potassium gluconate (E577), and concluded there was no safety concern for their use at the reported levels in foods.[^1] In the EU, it must also meet compositional and purity criteria set in the additives specifications regulation.[^4]

## Does potassium gluconate have any benefits?
In foods, its benefits are technological: it helps keep products stable and tasting consistent. As a nutrient source, it contributes small amounts of potassium. Diets that provide adequate potassium support normal blood pressure and proper function of nerves and muscles, though the amount from E577 at typical use levels is usually minor compared with daily needs.[^5]

## Who should avoid potassium gluconate?
Most healthy people do not need to avoid potassium gluconate in foods. However, people who must limit potassium—such as those with kidney disease or those taking certain medicines that raise blood potassium—should follow medical advice and be mindful of total potassium from all sources.[^6]

## Myths & facts
- “Gluconate” is not the same as “glutamate.” Potassium gluconate does not contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).
- E-numbers are not a warning sign by themselves—they are codes for approved additives that meet safety and purity rules.
- It is not a sweetener; it is used to stabilize foods and manage acidity.

## Potassium gluconate in branded foods
You may spot potassium gluconate on labels for some electrolyte drinks, flavored waters, canned or jarred fruits and vegetables, sauces, and other processed foods where acidity or mineral balance needs fine-tuning. Labels may list it by name or as E577.
