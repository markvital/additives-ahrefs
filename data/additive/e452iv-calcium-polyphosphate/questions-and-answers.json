      "q": "how does polyphosphate remove calcium",
      "a": "It acts as a sequestrant: the polyphosphate chain binds Ca2+ at multiple oxygen sites to form soluble complexes, preventing calcium from precipitating or causing scale/texture issues. Over time, hydrolysis to orthophosphate can convert some bound calcium into insoluble calcium phosphate, effectively removing it from solution.",

      "q": "when calcium ions complex with sodium metaphosphate, a solid calcium phosphate precipitate forms",
      "a": "Not initiallyâ€”calcium typically remains in soluble complexes with sodium metaphosphate (a polyphosphate). Precipitation of calcium phosphate generally occurs after the polyphosphate hydrolyzes to orthophosphate or under conditions (e.g., high pH/aging) that drive conversion.",
