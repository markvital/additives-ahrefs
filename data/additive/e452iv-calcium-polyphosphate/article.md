Calcium polyphosphate (E452iv) is a family of calcium salts made from chains of phosphate units. Food makers use it to hold moisture, help oil and water mix, and keep texture steady in many processed foods. It also goes by calcium metaphosphate.

## At a glance
- What it is: a calcium salt of long phosphate chains; part of the “polyphosphates” group with the code E452iv.
- What it does: works as an emulsifier, stabiliser, thickener, humectant (keeps foods moist), and sequestrant (binds metal ions).
- Where it’s found: processed meats and seafood, processed cheese, bakery mixes, and some powdered drinks.
- Label names: E452iv, calcium polyphosphate, calcium metaphosphate.
- Safety: regulated in the EU and U.S.; EFSA set a group Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus per kilogram of body weight per day; people with kidney disease may need to limit phosphate.

## Why is Calcium polyphosphate added to food?
Food makers add calcium polyphosphate to do several jobs at once. It helps oil and water stay blended (emulsifier), stabilises texture, thickens mixtures, binds water so foods stay juicy (humectant), and ties up trace metals that can cause off-flavours or haze (sequestrant).[^3]

## What foods contain Calcium polyphosphate?
You can find calcium polyphosphate most often in:
- Processed meat and poultry products (to improve juiciness and sliceability)
- Processed seafood like shrimp or surimi
- Processed cheese and cheese spreads (to keep a smooth melt)
- Some bakery mixes, dessert powders, and powdered drinks

In the EU, phosphates including polyphosphates are used across several categories such as processed meats, fish products, and processed cheese. EFSA reviewed these uses during its re-evaluation of phosphate additives.[^1] In the U.S., phosphates are permitted in many meat and poultry items for water retention and texture, usually with a maximum of 0.5% in the finished product.[^2]

## What can replace Calcium polyphosphate?
Possible substitutes depend on the job you need done:
- For sequestration and buffering: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid){.additive} or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates){.additive}
- For similar phosphate functionality: [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates){.additive}, [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates){.additive}, or [sodium polyphosphate](/e452i-sodium-polyphosphate){.additive}
- For thickening and stabilising: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, or [locust bean gum](/e410-locust-bean-gum){.additive}
- For cheese emulsification: citrate-based salts and certain [sodium phosphates](/e339-sodium-phosphates){.additive}, depending on the recipe

## How is Calcium polyphosphate made?
Polyphosphates are made by heating simple phosphates so they condense into longer chains. To make the calcium form, these chains (or polyphosphoric acid) are neutralised with calcium to give calcium polyphosphate (often a mixture of chain lengths).[^4]

## Is Calcium polyphosphate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a group ADI—Acceptable Daily Intake—for all phosphate additives of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as phosphorus. EFSA noted that some groups, especially children, could exceed this ADI at high consumption levels of phosphate-containing foods.[^1] In the U.S., phosphates used in meat and poultry are limited by regulation (typically not more than 0.5% of the finished product), which helps control overall exposure from those foods.[^2]

## Does Calcium polyphosphate have any benefits?
Yes. In foods, it helps keep textures stable and moist, improves sliceability, and supports even melting in processed cheese. It also binds trace metals that can dull flavour or cause cloudiness, and it helps emulsify fat and water in complex recipes.[^3]

## Who should avoid Calcium polyphosphate?
People told by their clinician to follow a low‑phosphate diet—especially those with chronic kidney disease—should limit phosphate additives, including calcium polyphosphate. Managing phosphorus intake is a standard part of kidney‑friendly eating plans.[^5]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as calcium phosphate.” Fact: Calcium polyphosphate is made of phosphate chains; calcium phosphate refers to simpler salts. They act differently in food.
- Myth: “It adds a lot of calcium.” Fact: It’s used at low levels for technology, not as a meaningful calcium source.
- Myth: “All phosphates are identical.” Fact: There are many phosphate salts (di-, tri-, and polyphosphates), each with different strengths in food processing.

## Calcium polyphosphate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E452iv,” “calcium polyphosphate,” or “calcium metaphosphate.” It most often appears on sliced deli meats, cured meats, processed seafood, and processed cheese products. Powdered drink and dessert mixes may also use polyphosphates for stability. If you are limiting phosphorus, compare similar products and choose items without phosphate additives.
