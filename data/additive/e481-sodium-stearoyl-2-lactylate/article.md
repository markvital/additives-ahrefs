Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate (E481) is a food emulsifier that helps water and fat mix smoothly. Bakers use it to strengthen dough, improve volume and crumb, and keep bread softer for longer. It is authorised for use in both the U.S. and the EU under specific regulations.

## At a glance
This additive shows up most often in breads and other baked goods as a dough conditioner and emulsifier.
- What it is: The sodium salt of stearoyl-2-lactylic acids; often shortened to SSL
- What it does: Emulsifies, stabilises foams, strengthens dough, and improves texture
- Common in: Yeast breads, buns, rolls, tortillas, cakes, dessert mixes, non-dairy toppings
- Also called: Sodium stearoyl lactylate; E481
- How it’s made: Lactic acid and stearic acid are combined, then neutralised with sodium
- Dietary notes: Typically made from vegetable oils and fermentable sugars; source can vary by manufacturer
- Label reading: Look for “sodium stearoyl lactylate” or “SSL”

## Why is Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate added to food?
Food makers add SSL to help oil and water stay mixed and to stabilise bubbles in batters and foams. In bread dough, it strengthens the gluten network, which can improve gas retention and oven spring, leading to better volume and a finer crumb. It is classed as an emulsifier and stabiliser in European rules and scientific reviews.[^2]

## What foods contain Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate?
You will most often find SSL in:
- Yeast-leavened breads, buns, rolls, and tortillas
- Cakes, cake mixes, and dessert mixes
- Non-dairy whipped toppings and creams
- Some breakfast pastries and bakery fillings

In the United States, sodium stearoyl lactylate is a food additive permitted for direct addition to certain foods under specific conditions laid out in the Code of Federal Regulations.[^1] In the European Union, E481 is authorised and has established purity criteria in the additive specifications regulation.[^3]

## What can replace Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate?
Several ingredients can play similar roles, depending on the food:
- Emulsifiers: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive}, and the related [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}
- Hydrocolloids for structure: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}
- Baking enzymes that help dough handling: [alpha-amylase](/e1100-alpha-amylase){.additive}, [lipase](/e1104-lipase){.additive}

The best swap depends on whether the goal is emulsifying fat, strengthening dough, improving softness, or stabilising foam.

## How is Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate made?
SSL is produced by reacting stearic acid (a fatty acid) with lactic acid to form stearoyl-2-lactylic acids, then neutralising the product with a sodium base such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. U.S. regulations also set specifications for composition and purity that the final additive must meet.[^1]

## Is Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate safe to eat?
Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic consider SSL safe when used as allowed. In the U.S., it is permitted for specific uses and levels in foods, as listed in federal regulations.[^1] In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated E481 and concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels, and the additive is authorised with specifications in EU law.[^2][^3]

## Does Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate have any benefits?
SSL brings technical benefits to foods:
- Better mixing of fats and water for smoother batters and creams
- Stronger, more elastic dough that holds gas well during proofing and baking
- Softer crumb and improved sliceability in finished bread
These are quality and handling benefits for the food, not health benefits for the consumer.

## Who should avoid Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate?
- People on strict sodium-restricted diets may choose to limit highly processed foods that contain multiple sodium-based additives.
- Strict vegetarians or vegans who want to avoid animal-derived ingredients should check with manufacturers, since stearic acid can be sourced from either animal fats or vegetable oils.
- Individuals who prefer shorter labels can look for products that use alternatives like [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive} or [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive} instead, understanding that performance may differ.

## Myths & facts
- “Lactylate means it has lactose or milk.” False. “Lactylate” refers to lactic acid, which is commonly made by fermenting sugars; it is not the same as lactose or milk proteins.
- “It’s only an emulsifier.” Partly true. SSL is an emulsifier, but bakers also use it as a dough strengthener and crumb improver.
- “It always comes from animal fat.” Not necessarily. The stearic acid can be plant- or animal-derived; the source varies by supplier and product.

## Sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sodium stearoyl lactylate” or “SSL.” It commonly appears in packaged sandwich bread, burger buns, hot dog rolls, tortillas, some cakes and mixes, and whipped toppings. If you are comparing brands, check the full ingredient list, since some products use related emulsifiers like [calcium stearoyl-2-lactylate](/e482-calcium-stearoyl-2-lactylate){.additive}, [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids){.additive}, or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins){.additive} instead.
