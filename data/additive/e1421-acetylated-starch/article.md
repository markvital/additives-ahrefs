Acetylated starch (E1421) is a modified starch used to thicken, stabilize, and emulsify many everyday foods. It is made by attaching small acetyl groups to starch from plants like corn, potato, or tapioca, which helps foods keep a smooth, steady texture during processing and storage. It has long been approved by major regulators and is used at the minimum level needed for its effect.

## At a glance
- What it is: A “modified” starch whose molecules carry a few acetyl groups; also called starch acetate, mono starch acetate, or acetylated starch.
- What it does: Works as a thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier to keep sauces, dressings, fillings, and drinks smooth.
- Where it comes from: Plant starch (typically corn, potato, or tapioca) that has been processed to improve performance in food.
- How it’s labeled: On ingredient lists you may see “acetylated starch,” “starch acetate,” or “modified food starch.”
- Typical level: Added at low levels, just enough to do the job.

## Why is Acetylated starch added to food?
Food makers use acetylated starch to build or hold texture when heat, acid, or mixing might break down regular starch. It keeps sauces glossy, helps dairy and dessert gels stay uniform, and improves the stability of emulsions like dressings. In the European Union, modified starches are authorised “quantum satis,” which means only as much as is needed for the effect, and their main functions are thickening, stabilising, and emulsifying.[^2]

## What foods contain Acetylated starch?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Soups, sauces, gravies, and ready meals
- Salad dressings, dips, and emulsified beverages
- Fruit fillings, jams, and dessert toppings
- Dairy products like yogurt, custards, and ice creams
- Baked goods and gluten-free products that need extra structure

In the United States, “food starch-modified” (which includes starch acetate) is permitted as a thickener, stabilizer, or texturizer in foods under good manufacturing practice, a regulatory standard that means only the amount necessary may be used.[^1]

## What can replace Acetylated starch?
Depending on the recipe and process, similar results can come from:
- Other modified starches such as [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch){.additive}, [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate){.additive}, or [acetylated distarch phosphate](/e1414-acetylated-distarch-phosphate){.additive}
- Hydrocolloid gums like [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum){.additive}, [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum){.additive}, [pectins](/e440-pectins){.additive}, [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan){.additive}, or [acacia gum](/e414-acacia-gum){.additive}
- Cellulose-based thickeners such as [microcrystalline cellulose](/e460i-microcrystalline-cellulose){.additive}
- Seaweed-derived alginates like [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate){.additive}

The best substitute depends on factors such as pH, salt, sugar, heat treatment, freeze–thaw cycles, and desired mouthfeel.

## How is Acetylated starch made?
Food starch from plant sources is reacted with small amounts of acetic reagents, such as acetic anhydride or vinyl acetate, usually in a mild alkaline (basic) environment. The starch is then washed, filtered, and dried to remove residual processing agents, leaving a food-grade acetylated starch that performs more reliably during cooking and storage.[^1] Regulators describe this process so manufacturers meet purity and safety specifications for food use.[^2]

## Is Acetylated starch safe to eat?
Yes, when used as intended. In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated modified starches and found no safety concern at reported uses, assigning an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) “not specified,” which is the most favorable safety category for food additives.[^2] In the United States, acetylated starch (as a type of “food starch-modified”) is allowed in foods under the Code of Federal Regulations, reflecting its established safety under good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## Does Acetylated starch have any benefits?
- For food quality: It helps sauces, fillings, and emulsions keep a smooth, stable texture through heating, mixing, and storage.
- For manufacturing: It improves process tolerance, so products are less likely to separate or thin out on the line.
- For consumers: It is largely tasteless and does not cloud flavors, so it supports texture without changing taste.

## Who should avoid Acetylated starch?
- People with wheat allergy or coeliac disease should check the source. Most acetylated starch comes from corn, potato, or tapioca, but it can also be made from wheat starch. In the U.S., major allergens like wheat must be declared on the label, which helps shoppers identify the source.[^3]
- Individuals on medically prescribed diets that limit carbohydrates should follow their healthcare provider’s advice, since acetylated starch is still a form of digestible starch.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Modified” means genetically modified. Fact: Here, “modified” describes a small chemical change to starch molecules, not gene editing or genetic engineering.
- Myth: It is a plastic-like additive. Fact: It is a carbohydrate derived from edible starch that regulators have evaluated and permitted for use in foods.[^2]
- Myth: It adds strong flavor. Fact: It is practically tasteless and is used for texture, not flavor.

## Acetylated starch in branded foods
On packaging, you may see it listed as “acetylated starch,” “starch acetate,” or simply “modified food starch.” It appears in brands across categories such as soups, sauces, dressings, frozen meals, fruit fillings, dairy desserts, and baked goods. Labels sometimes also reveal the plant source (for example, “modified corn starch”), which is helpful for people avoiding specific allergens.
