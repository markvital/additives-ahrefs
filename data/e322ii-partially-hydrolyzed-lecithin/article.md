Partially hydrolyzed lecithin (E322II) is a form of lecithin that has been gently split to make it disperse better in water. It is mainly used as an emulsifier and antioxidant to keep foods smooth, stable, and fresh-tasting. You’ll often find it in chocolate, baked goods, spreads, and instant mixes.

## At a glance
- What it is: A modified form of [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) made by breaking some fatty acid groups, creating more water‑friendly phospholipids (often called lysolecithins).
- What it does: Emulsifies oil and water, improves wetting and dispersion, stabilizes foam, and can help protect flavors and fats from oxidation.
- Common sources: Usually from soy, sunflower, or rapeseed (can also be made from egg yolk). Check the label if you avoid certain sources.
- How it’s labeled: “E322,” “E322(ii),” “partially hydrolyzed lecithin,” or “hydrolysed lecithin.”
- Diet notes: Typically vegan when from plant oils. Soy- or egg‑derived versions must be labeled as such in the U.S.
- Regulation: Authorized in the EU as E322 and considered “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) in the U.S.

## Why is Partially hydrolyzed lecithin added to food?
Manufacturers use it to blend ingredients that don’t usually mix (like oil and water) and to improve texture and shelf stability. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists lecithin as GRAS for use as an emulsifier and release agent, applied at levels needed for good manufacturing practice (GMP, meaning no more than necessary for the intended effect).[^1]

## What foods contain Partially hydrolyzed lecithin?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Chocolate and compound coatings (for flow and gloss)
- Bakery items and doughs (for mixing, softness, and anti-sticking)
- Margarine and spreads (for stability)
- Instant drink powders and creamers (for better wetting)
- Sauces, dressings, and plant‑based milks (for smooth texture)

Ingredient lists may show “lecithin,” “hydrolyzed lecithin,” or “E322/E322(ii).”

## What can replace Partially hydrolyzed lecithin?
Depending on the job, similar emulsifiers or stabilizers can be used:
- For general emulsifying: [mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [sodium stearoyl‑2‑lactylate](/e481-sodium-stearoyl-2-lactylate)
- For chocolate flow/viscosity: [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate)
- For added emulsifying power: [citric acid esters of mono‑ and diglycerides](/e472c-citric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids), [mono‑ and diacetyl tartaric acid esters](/e472e-mono-and-diacetyltartaric-acid-esters-of-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids)
- For thickening or suspension: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum)
- For antioxidant support: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) in suitable applications

The best substitute depends on the food, processing method, and desired label.

## How is Partially hydrolyzed lecithin made?
First, lecithin is obtained from edible oils (commonly soy, sunflower, or rapeseed) or from egg yolk. The oil is “degummed,” and the phospholipid‑rich fraction is separated and purified as lecithin. The lecithin is then partially hydrolyzed—often with food‑grade enzymes—to remove some fatty acid groups. This increases its hydrophilicity (water‑loving nature), improving wetting and dispersion in water‑based foods.[^2] In the EU, lecithins used as food additives must meet detailed identity and purity specifications set in law.[^3]

## Is Partially hydrolyzed lecithin safe to eat?
Yes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated lecithins (E 322)—including hydrolysed types—and found no safety concern at permitted uses and use levels in foods.[^2] In the U.S., the FDA lists lecithin as GRAS when used in line with good manufacturing practice, reflecting a long history of safe use in foods.[^1]

## Does Partially hydrolyzed lecithin have any benefits?
- In foods: It improves mixing, texture, stability, and can help maintain flavor quality by limiting oxidation.
- In the diet: Lecithin contains choline‑bearing phospholipids. Choline is an essential nutrient, but the amount contributed by lecithin used as an additive is usually small compared with normal dietary sources.[^4]

## Who should avoid Partially hydrolyzed lecithin?
- People with soy or egg allergies should check labels. In the U.S., major allergens like soy and egg must be declared on packaged foods, so “soy lecithin” or “egg lecithin” will be named when used.[^5]
- Those following strict dietary rules (e.g., vegan) should look for plant‑based sources (soy, sunflower, rapeseed) and avoid egg‑derived lecithin.

## Myths & facts
- “Hydrolyzed” means harsh chemicals were used — Not necessarily. Food makers commonly use food‑grade enzymes to split lecithin into more water‑friendly forms.
- Lecithin is a synthetic chemical — False. It’s derived from edible oils (or egg yolk) and must meet official purity specifications in the EU.[^3]
- Hydrolyzed lecithin is the same as hydrogenated oil — No. Hydrolysis splits molecules with water; hydrogenation adds hydrogen to double bonds. They are different processes.
- If a product contains lecithin, it must contain lots of soy protein — Not necessarily. Lecithin is a fat‑rich fraction with very little protein, but soy‑derived lecithin still must be labeled as “soy” in the U.S., which helps people with allergies identify it.[^5]

## Partially hydrolyzed lecithin in branded foods
You may spot it on ingredient lists for popular chocolates, spreads, cookies, cakes, instant cocoa and coffee mixes, non‑dairy creamers, and salad dressings. It often appears near the end of the list because only small amounts are needed to do its job. Look for “lecithin,” “hydrolyzed lecithin,” “E322,” or “E322(ii).”
