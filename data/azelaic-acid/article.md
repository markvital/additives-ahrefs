## Why it matters
- Visibly brightens lingering post-acne marks and melasma when used consistently.
- Has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that help calm breakouts and flushing.
- Gentle enough for sensitive and rosacea-prone skin when formulated well.

## How to use it
- Apply once or twice daily after cleansing; serums between 10% and 20% are common.
- Combine with niacinamide or sunscreen to amplify tone-evening benefits.
- Layer under moisturizer and avoid mixing with strong exfoliating acids in the same routine if skin feels reactive.
