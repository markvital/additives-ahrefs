## Why it matters
- Visibly brightens dull, uneven skin tone by accelerating surface exfoliation.
- Encourages fresh collagen production, helping soften fine lines with ongoing use.
- Preps skin to absorb follow-up serums more evenly by clearing surface buildup.

## How to use it
- Introduce leave-on treatments (5%â€“10%) two to three nights per week before moisturizer.
- Alternate with retinoids or other actives to avoid over-exfoliation.
- Buffer with hydrating serums or creams if you experience stinging or dryness.
