      "q": "what is e331 in food",
      "a": "E331 is sodium citrates—the mono-, di-, and trisodium salts of citric acid—used mainly as acidity regulators/buffers, sequestrants, and emulsifying salts in foods like soft drinks and processed cheese.",

      "q": "how are sodium citrates used in molecular gastronomy",
      "a": "They’re used to adjust and buffer pH, chelate calcium, and act as an emulsifying salt—commonly to make ultra-smooth, meltable cheese sauces and to tune acidity/calcium levels for techniques like spherification and stabilizing foams.",

    {
      "q": "what are sodium citrates degradation byproducts",
      "a": "Under normal food use they’re stable; with strong heating/combustion they decompose to carbon oxides (CO2/CO) and sodium oxides (and related inorganic residues).",

      "q": "why does sodium citrates burn",
      "a": "It isn’t flammable; any “burning” sensation typically comes from irritation of skin, eyes, or mouth at high concentrations due to its mildly alkaline, saline nature, and on heating it decomposes rather than sustaining a flame.",
