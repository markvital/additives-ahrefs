Sorbitan monostearate (E491) is an emulsifier used to help oil and water mix and stay mixed in foods. It is an ester made from sorbitan (derived from sorbitol) and stearic acid, and it helps keep textures smooth and stable.

## At a glance
- Role: Emulsifier that stabilizes mixtures of oil and water
- What it is: An ester of sorbitan and stearic acid
- Typical foods: Baked goods, whipped toppings, chocolate and confectionery, dessert mixes, coffee whiteners, margarine and spreads, ice cream
- Label names: Sorbitan monostearate or E491 (in the EU)
- Dietary notes: Usually made from vegetable oils, but stearic acid can also come from animal fat—check with the maker if vegan/vegetarian status matters
- Heat and process stable; helps improve texture, volume, and shelf life

## Why is Sorbitan monostearate added to food?
Food makers use E491 to keep oil and water from separating, which protects texture and appearance. It supports stable foams and batters, improves air incorporation in cakes, and helps spreads and fillings hold together during storage and transport. In chocolate and confectionery, it can improve flow and reduce fat separation, aiding consistent molding and coating.

## What foods contain Sorbitan monostearate?
You’ll most often see E491 in:
- Cakes, muffins, and baking mixes
- Whipped toppings, dessert mixes, and instant puddings
- Chocolate and confectionery coatings
- Margarine, spreads, and coffee whiteners
- Ice cream and frozen desserts
- Some nutrition bars and powdered drink mixes

On ingredient lists, it may appear as “sorbitan monostearate,” “E491,” or alongside other emulsifiers.

## What can replace Sorbitan monostearate?
Possible alternatives (chosen case by case) include:
- Other sorbitan esters: [sorbitan monolaurate](/e493-sorbitan-monolaurate) (E493), [sorbitan monooleate](/e494-sorbitan-monooleate) (E494), [sorbitan monopalmitate](/e495-sorbitan-monopalmitate) (E495), or [sorbitan tristearate](/e492-sorbitan-tristearate) (E492)
- [Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) (E471)
- [Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids](/e477-propane-1-2-diol-esters-of-fatty-acids) (E477)
- [Lecithins](/e322-lecithins) (E322)
- Hydrocolloids for texture in water-based systems, such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum) (E415) or [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), when an emulsifier is not essential

The best substitute depends on the recipe, fat content, and whether the emulsion is water-in-oil or oil-in-water.

## How is Sorbitan monostearate made?
E491 is produced by reacting sorbitan (made by dehydrating sorbitol) with stearic acid from edible fats and oils. The result is a waxy solid mixture in which stearic acid is esterified to the sorbitan molecule; small amounts of related esters can be present under defined purity limits.[^1] It is typically supplied as an off‑white, wax-like material that disperses in warm oils before being mixed into foods.[^3]

## Is Sorbitan monostearate safe to eat?
In the European Union, sorbitan monostearate (E491) is an authorised food additive with specific purity criteria set in law.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated the sorbitan esters group (E491–E495) in 2017 and concluded there is no safety concern for consumers at the reported uses and use levels.[^2] As with all additives, manufacturers must stay within permitted use categories and levels established in EU legislation.[^2]

ADI, short for acceptable daily intake, is a health-based guidance value used by regulators. EFSA reviewed exposure estimates for adults and children and found typical intakes from food were within the group ADI, supporting continued use under current conditions.[^2]

## Does Sorbitan monostearate have any benefits?
For food quality, yes. E491 helps:
- Keep emulsions stable and reduce oiling-off
- Improve aeration and volume in cakes and whipped toppings
- Maintain smooth, creamy textures and slow staling in baked goods
These are technological benefits to the food; E491 is not added for nutritional or medical effects.

## Who should avoid Sorbitan monostearate?
- Strict vegans or certain religious diets: Stearic acid can be sourced from either vegetable oils or animal fat. When this matters, look for products labeled accordingly or ask the manufacturer about the source.[^1]
- People following medical advice to limit emulsifiers should consult their healthcare provider. For the general population, regulatory reviews have not identified safety concerns at approved use levels.[^2]

Note: Sorbitan monostearate is not the same as [sorbitol](/e420-sorbitol) (E420), a sugar alcohol; it is an ester and is used in much smaller amounts.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E491 is just sugar alcohol.”  
  Fact: It is an ester of sorbitan and stearic acid, used as an emulsifier, not a sweetener.
- Myth: “All emulsifiers are synthetic and unsafe.”  
  Fact: Emulsifiers vary widely. E491 has been reviewed by EU authorities and is authorised with purity criteria and use limits.
- Myth: “If a product has E491, it must contain animal fat.”  
  Fact: The stearic acid can come from vegetable or animal sources; many suppliers use vegetable oils, but source can vary.
- Myth: “E491 and [polyglycerol polyricinoleate](/e476-polyglycerol-polyricinoleate) do the same thing.”  
  Fact: Both are emulsifiers, but they have different strengths and are chosen for different tasks and formulas.

## Sorbitan monostearate in branded foods
On labels, look for “sorbitan monostearate” or “E491.” You’ll find it in a variety of everyday items such as cakes and pastries, whipped toppings, chocolate coatings, spreads, and some frozen desserts. Manufacturers often combine it with other emulsifiers like [mono- and diglycerides](/e471-mono-and-diglycerides-of-fatty-acids) or [lecithins](/e322-lecithins) to fine‑tune texture and stability.
