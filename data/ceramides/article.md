Ceramides are a family of waxy lipids that naturally make up about half of the skinâ€™s protective barrier. Topical ceramides replace what is depleted by age, harsh cleansers, or environmental stress.

## Why it matters
- Rebuilds the lipid matrix that keeps moisture in and irritants out.
- Plays well with cholesterol and fatty acids in moisturizers to restore balance.
- Helps offset dryness from retinoids, exfoliants, or seasonal changes.

## How to use it
- Look for moisturizers that list ceramides (NP, AP, EOP) in the first half of the ingredient list.
- Layer ceramide creams after hydrating serums to seal in water-based actives.
- Pair with occlusives like squalane or petrolatum if skin feels particularly compromised.
