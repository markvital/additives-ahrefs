      "q": "does too much calcium affect how well metoprolol tartrate works to lower heartbeat",
      "a": "No—there’s no evidence that the small amounts of calcium from the food additive E354 (calcium tartrate) affect metoprolol tartrate’s effect; the “tartrate” in the drug name is just the salt form and isn’t related to dietary tartrate. If taking high-dose calcium supplements, spacing them a couple of hours from medicines is a general precaution—ask a pharmacist if unsure.",
