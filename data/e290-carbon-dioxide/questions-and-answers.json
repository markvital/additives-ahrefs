      "q": "how to treat low carbon dioxide in blood",
      "a": "Low CO2 (bicarbonate) in blood is a medical issue indicating a respiratory or metabolic imbalance; treatment depends on the cause (e.g., correcting acidosis, fluids, adjusting ventilation) and should be guided by a clinician. It isn’t treated by consuming carbonated drinks or food-grade E290.",

    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a compound",
      "a": "Yes—carbon dioxide is a chemical compound (CO2) made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.",

    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide a pure substance",
      "a": "Yes—pure CO2 is a pure substance, and food‑grade E290 is purified to high specifications for use in foods and beverages.",

    {
      "q": "is carbon dioxide bad for you",
      "a": "At the levels used in foods and drinks, carbon dioxide (E290) is considered safe (approved in the EU and GRAS in the U.S.); the main risks are from breathing high concentrations or mishandling dry ice. Acidic, sugary carbonated beverages can contribute to dental erosion, but the CO2 additive itself isn’t a toxic concern at typical exposures.",

    {
      "q": "where does carbon dioxide come from",
      "a": "Food‑grade carbon dioxide typically comes from natural wells, fermentation streams (e.g., breweries), or captured industrial CO2, then is purified for use in carbonation, packaging, and as a propellant.",
