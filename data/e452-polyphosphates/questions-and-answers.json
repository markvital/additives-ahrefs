      "q": "girlsdoporn e452 who is she",
      "a": "That appears unrelated to the food additive E452; E452 refers to polyphosphates, synthetic phosphate salts used in foods as emulsifiers, stabilizers, humectants, and sequestrants.",

      "q": "how does polyphosphates reduce affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen",
      "a": "Inorganic polyphosphate can bind to positively charged sites on deoxyhemoglobin and stabilize the low‑affinity T-state, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right and lowering O2 affinity. This is a biochemical interaction and not a typical food-use effect of E452.",

      "q": "how many states use polyphosphates",
      "a": "There’s no official tally; polyphosphates are used by many water utilities across numerous U.S. states and worldwide for iron/manganese sequestration and scale/corrosion control, depending on local water chemistry.",

    {
      "q": "how many states use polyphosphates to treat water",
      "a": "No centralized count exists, but hundreds of U.S. community water systems in dozens of states use phosphate-based treatments (often polyphosphates or poly/ortho blends) for metal sequestration and corrosion control. Usage changes over time with source water and regulations.",

    {
      "q": "how to remove polyphosphates from drinking water",
      "a": "Effective options include reverse osmosis or nanofiltration, and strong‑base anion exchange; utilities may also use coagulation/precipitation with iron or alum followed by filtration. Polyphosphates hydrolyze to orthophosphate over time, which the same processes remove; activated carbon and boiling are generally ineffective.",
