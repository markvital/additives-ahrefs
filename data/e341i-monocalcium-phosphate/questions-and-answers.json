      "q": "what does monocalcium phosphate do to your body",
      "a": "It dissociates into calcium and phosphate ions, common nutrients involved in bone structure and cellular energy, and at normal intakes has no special effects beyond contributing small amounts of these minerals; very high phosphate intake can disrupt mineral balance, especially with kidney problems.",
