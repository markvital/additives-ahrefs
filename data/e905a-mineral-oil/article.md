Mineral oil (E905a) is a highly refined, food‑grade oil derived from petroleum and used mainly to make foods shiny and to keep them from sticking. It’s approved in both the United States and the European Union with strict purity specifications and restricted technical uses to protect consumers.<!--more-->

## At a glance
- What it is: a clear, tasteless, odorless “white mineral oil” made to food-grade standards
- What it does: glazing agent, pan‑release/lubricant, and sometimes a defoaming aid in processing
- Where you’ll find it: shiny confectionery, coated dried fruit or nuts, chewing gum, and on some fresh produce
- Label names: “mineral oil” or “E905a” (EU); “white mineral oil” (US)
- Dietary notes: vegan/vegetarian; derived from petroleum, not animals
- Heat stable and neutral in flavor; used in tiny amounts for surface effects
- Regulated: permitted with specifications in the US (FDA) and EU (E‑number E905a)

## Why is mineral oil added to food?
Manufacturers use mineral oil because it gives products a smooth, glossy surface and helps prevent sticking. In the US, FDA regulations allow “white mineral oil” for specific direct uses in food, such as protective surface coatings and as a release/lubricating agent, provided it meets detailed purity specifications.[^1] It is also permitted as a defoaming agent in certain food processes (for example, sugar and yeast manufacture), which helps control foam without affecting the final product.[^2]

## What foods contain mineral oil?
You’ll most often see mineral oil in:
- Confectionery and chewing gum, where it adds shine and reduces sticking
- Dried fruits and some nuts, where a light coat improves appearance and handling
- Fresh produce, where a thin protective film can reduce moisture loss and scuffing
- Bakery production, where equipment may be treated so doughs or candies release cleanly

In the EU, E905a is an authorized food additive with specifications set at the Union level; in the US, “white mineral oil” is allowed for defined uses under federal regulations.[^1][^3]

## What can replace mineral oil?
Alternatives depend on the job:
- For shine or surface protection: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), or [shellac](/e904-shellac)
- For similar petroleum‑derived coatings: [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax) or [microcrystalline wax](/e905ci-microcrystalline-wax)
- For pan release: plant oils or emulsions, or tailored emulsifiers
- For defoaming in processing: [dimethylpolysiloxane](/e900-dimethylpolysiloxane-and-methylphenylpolysiloxane)

## How is mineral oil made?
Food‑grade mineral oil is produced by refining selected petroleum fractions until they are highly saturated and free of objectionable impurities. Regulatory specifications focus on identity and purity, including limits assessed by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance and other tests to ensure low levels of aromatic hydrocarbons and consistent performance.[^1][^3]

## Is mineral oil safe to eat?
When used as permitted, mineral oil is considered safe by major regulators. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes “white mineral oil” for specific food uses and sets detailed specifications to ensure high purity.[^1] In the EU, E905a is listed with Union specifications that define the additive and its purity criteria for safe use.[^3] Broader safety evaluations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) note that mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) are a diverse group and that the aromatic fraction (MOAH) with multiple rings can raise concerns; however, food‑grade mineral oils are highly refined to minimize these components as part of meeting regulatory specifications.[^4]

## Does mineral oil have any benefits?
- Product quality: a thin coat can reduce stickiness, improve gloss, and help protect delicate surfaces during transport.
- Shelf handling: coatings can reduce moisture loss and scuffing on certain foods.
- Processing efficiency: as a defoamer in defined processes, it helps control foam and maintain throughput without altering flavor.[^2]

## Who should avoid mineral oil?
- If you prefer to avoid petroleum‑derived additives for personal, ethical, or product‑philosophy reasons, choose foods glazed with plant or insect waxes such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax).
- If your healthcare provider has advised limiting exposure to mineral oil for medical reasons, check labels for “mineral oil” or “E905a” and opt for alternatives listed above.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Mineral oil in food is just motor oil.”  
  Fact: Food‑grade “white mineral oil” is extensively refined and must meet stringent identity and purity tests before use in food.[^1]
- Myth: “Mineral oil is banned in Europe.”  
  Fact: Mineral oil is authorized in the EU as E905a with specifications laid out in EU law.[^3]

## Mineral oil in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “mineral oil,” “white mineral oil,” or “E905a” (in the EU). It is common on shiny candies and coated dried fruits or nuts. Some bakery or confectionery items may be processed with release agents, which are sometimes not present in meaningful amounts in the final food; where present as an additive, labels should list it by name or E‑number according to local rules.
