Calcium formiate (E238), also called calcium formate, is the calcium salt of formic acid used mainly as a preservative in acidic foods. Its use in everyday retail foods is uncommon and can vary by country and product type. Always check the label for “E238” or “calcium formate” if you’re looking for it.

## At a glance
- E-number: E238
- Names: Calcium formiate; calcium formate (synonym)
- What it does: Helps preserve acidic foods by slowing the growth of microbes
- Where you might see it: Rare in retail foods; more common in technical and feed applications
- Label check: Listed as “E238,” “calcium formate,” or “calcium formiate”

## Why is Calcium formiate added to food?
Calcium formiate works as a preservative. It helps keep some acidic foods safe and stable by slowing or stopping the growth of bacteria and molds in low pH (more acidic) conditions.[^1]

In the European Union (EU), substances on the Union list of food additives are authorised for specific technological functions, such as preservation, only after a safety evaluation and under defined conditions of use.[^2]

## What foods contain Calcium formiate?
You are unlikely to see E238 often on supermarket labels. When used, it is typically in acidic foods where a preservative is helpful—think sour or pickled products and other low‑pH foods—though approvals and actual use vary by country and manufacturer. Always check the ingredient list for “E238” or “calcium formate.”

## What can replace Calcium formiate?
Several preservatives can serve similar roles, depending on the food and the desired taste and pH:
- [Formic acid](/e236-formic-acid) in systems designed for its use
- [Sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate)
- [Benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid) or [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- [Calcium propionate](/e282-calcium-propionate) in baked goods

The best substitute depends on the recipe, pH, storage temperature, and local regulations.

## How is Calcium formiate made?
Calcium formiate is the calcium salt of formic acid. It is commonly produced by neutralising formic acid with a calcium base (such as calcium hydroxide), followed by purification and drying.[^3] This straightforward acid‑base reaction yields a stable, crystalline salt that dissolves in water.[^3]

## Is Calcium formiate safe to eat?
In the EU, food additives are permitted only after a safety assessment and are subject to purity criteria and conditions of use set in law.[^2] Calcium formiate (E238) has official EU specifications that define its identity and purity requirements when used as a food additive.[^1]

Like other formates, calcium formiate dissociates to formate ions, which are ordinary metabolites in mammals and are ultimately oxidised to carbon dioxide at normal exposure levels.[^3] When used within legal limits and good manufacturing practice, regulators have not identified safety concerns for its intended technological function.[^1]

## Does Calcium formiate have any benefits?
- Helps extend shelf life by slowing microbial growth in acidic foods
- Can help maintain quality during storage and distribution
These are technological benefits to the food; calcium formiate is not used as a nutrient.

## Who should avoid Calcium formiate?
- People advised by their healthcare provider to avoid formic acid/formate salts
- Individuals following a medically restricted diet
As with any additive, if you have concerns, consult your clinician or dietitian.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “All E‑numbers are harmful.”  
  Fact: In the EU, E‑numbers identify additives that have passed a safety evaluation and have defined purity and use conditions.[^2]
- Myth: “Calcium formiate is the same as formic acid.”  
  Fact: Calcium formiate is a salt that behaves differently in foods; it releases formate ions but is not the same as the acid itself.[^3]
- Myth: “If it’s in the EU specs, it’s always allowed in any food.”  
  Fact: Each additive has specific authorised food categories and limits; use is not universal across all foods.[^2]

## Calcium formiate in branded foods
You may not see E238 often on ingredient lists. Where permitted, it appears by name (“calcium formate” or “calcium formiate”) or as “E238.” Availability and use in branded products can vary by country and by product type, so label checking is the most reliable way to know.
