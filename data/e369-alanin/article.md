Alanin (L-alanine) is an amino acid used in foods as a mild flavor enhancer and pH buffer. U.S. labels list it as “L-alanine,” not by E-number, but some lists refer to it as E369. Look for it in ingredient lists of nutrition products and some processed foods.

At a glance
- Also called/E-number: Alanin, L-alanine; E369 (E-number labeling is not used on U.S. retail packages)
- What it does: Flavor enhancer (slightly sweet), pH buffer, nutrient (amino acid)
- Common in: Medical nutrition, sports drinks and powders, soups/sauces, confectionery, baked goods
- Diet flags: Typically vegan and gluten-free when made by fermentation; check with the maker if sourcing matters

1) Why it’s added to food
- L-alanine can add a light sweetness and balance flavors. It also helps buffer acidity in formulas and contributes nitrogen as a nutrient in medical nutrition products.
- Shopping tip: If you want simpler formulas, look for products without added “L-alanine.”

2) What foods it’s found in
- You may see “L-alanine” in sports beverages and powders, oral nutrition supplements, and some candy or bakery mixes.
- It can appear in soups, sauces, and ready meals as part of “amino acids” for flavor. Check ingredient lists for “L-alanine” or “alanine.”

3) What are its alternatives
- For mild sweetness or flavor roundness: glycine (listed as “glycine” or E640 in some regions), sugar, maltol/ethyl maltol.
- For acidity control: citric acid/citrates, malic acid, lactic acid.
- Shopping tip: If you want to avoid alanine, choose products using familiar sweeteners (e.g., sugar) or common acids (citric, malic).

4) How Alanin is manufactured
- Most food-grade L-alanine today is made by microbial fermentation using food carbohydrates, followed by purification.
- It can also be produced by enzymatic conversion (from pyruvate) or by chemical synthesis, with food-grade processes ensuring purity.

5) How safe is Alanin for consumption?
- Regulatory bodies have evaluated L-alanine (as a flavoring/nutrient) and found no safety concerns at typical food-use levels when produced to food-grade standards.
- Labeling in the U.S. uses the ingredient name (“L-alanine”), not an E-number. Always follow use directions on medical nutrition products.

  - { "source": "JECFA (WHO/FAO) flavoring evaluations", "url": "URL to be added by editor", "takeaway": "No safety concern at current levels of intake for L-alanine as a flavoring agent." }

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- L-alanine supplies nitrogen and calories and is included in clinical/medical nutrition formulas to help meet amino acid needs.
- It is not a medicine. Any therapeutic use should be under healthcare supervision in clinical nutrition settings.

7) When Alanin may be unsafe (contraindications)
- People on protein- or amino acid–restricted diets (for kidney or liver disease) should avoid added amino acids unless advised by a clinician.
- Individuals with rare metabolic disorders related to amino acid handling should follow medical guidance.
- For diabetes or blood sugar management, routine food amounts are small, but high-dose supplements may affect glucose handling; consult your clinician before using supplements.

Myths & facts
- Myth: Alanine (L-alanine) is the same as beta-alanine supplements. Fact: They are different amino acids with different uses in the body and in foods. Source: NIH (PubChem) — chemical identity and isomer distinctions. URL to be added by editor
- Myth: E-numbers are always synthetic and harmful. Fact: Many E-numbered additives are identical to substances found in nature; safety depends on dose and use. Source: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) — general information on food additives. URL to be added by editor
- Myth: People with sulfite sensitivity should avoid alanine. Fact: Sulfites are preservatives; alanine is an amino acid and is unrelated to sulfite reactions. Source: FDA — Sulfites in foods and labeling. URL to be added by editor

Alanin in Branded Foods
- In FoodData Central, L-alanine typically appears in sports nutrition products, oral nutrition supplements, and some soups/sauces or confectionery where amino acids are used for flavor or formulation.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- Is L-alanine (E369) allowed in U.S. foods? 
  Yes. U.S. labels list the ingredient name (“L-alanine”); E-numbers are an EU system. It may be used as a nutrient or flavoring in line with good manufacturing practice.
- Is alanine vegan?
  Usually yes when produced by fermentation. If sourcing matters, contact the manufacturer to confirm it is not derived from animal protein hydrolysates.
- Does alanine affect blood sugar?
  Alanine can be converted to glucose by the body, but amounts in foods are small. People using high-dose amino acid supplements should consult a clinician.
- What does alanine taste like?
  It has a mildly sweet taste and can round out flavors. It is not as sweet as sugar.
- How do I avoid alanine?
  Check labels for “L-alanine” or “alanine.” Choose alternatives that use common acids (citric/malic) or sweeteners (sugar) instead.
