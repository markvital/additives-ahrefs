      "q": "is methylparaben safe",
      "a": "Yes; regulators such as JECFA set an acceptable daily intake of 0–10 mg/kg body weight/day (for methyl and ethyl parabens), and typical dietary exposure is well below this.",

      "q": "does methylparaben cause cancer",
      "a": "There’s no convincing evidence that methylparaben causes cancer at dietary exposures, and it isn’t classified as a human carcinogen; its weak estrogenic activity occurs at doses far above food-use levels.",

      "q": "are methylparaben and propylparaben safe",

      "q": "is methylparaben bad for you",
