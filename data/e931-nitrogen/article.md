Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up most of the air we breathe. In food, it is used to push out oxygen, keep products fresh, and sometimes to create a smooth, creamy foam in “nitro” drinks. It does not add flavor or nutrients; it simply protects the food.

## At a glance
- What it is: Nitrogen gas (chemical symbol N2), colorless and inert.
- What it does in food: Fills packages to displace oxygen, protects flavor and texture, and can serve as a propellant or foaming gas.
- Common places you’ll see it: Snack packs, coffee and nuts, some fresh meat and poultry packs, and “nitro” beers or coffees.
- How it’s made: Separated from air by chilling and distillation, or with special filters.
- Safety: Recognized as safe when used as intended; it does not react in the body and simply passes through.
- Alternatives: [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide), [argon](/e938-argon), vacuum packaging, or, for foams, [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide).

## Why is Nitrogen added to food?
Food makers add nitrogen to push out oxygen in packages. This slows oxidation, which can cause rancid flavors, color changes, and loss of crispness, and it also discourages the growth of some oxygen-loving microbes without changing the taste of the food.[^2] Many food laws list nitrogen as a “packaging gas” or “propellant,” meaning its job is to create or maintain a protective atmosphere inside a sealed container.[^3]

## What foods contain Nitrogen?
You’ll most often find nitrogen in the headspace of sealed packages rather than mixed into the food itself. It is widely used in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for perishable foods, including some fresh meat and poultry, to help maintain quality and shelf life.[^4] Many snack foods like chips, crackers, and roasted nuts are “nitrogen-flushed” to keep them crisp, and some canned or draft-style beverages use nitrogen to form a fine, creamy foam and a smooth mouthfeel.[^2]

## What can replace Nitrogen?
Depending on the goal, several options exist:
- For shelf-life and flavor protection: [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide) and [argon](/e938-argon) are also used as packaging gases, alone or blended with nitrogen.[^3]
- For low-oxygen storage without added gas: vacuum packaging can reduce oxygen but may alter texture or appearance in some foods.
- For aerated foams and whipped textures: [nitrous oxide](/e942-nitrous-oxide) is commonly used in pressurized cream and dessert aerosols.

## How is Nitrogen made?
Industrial nitrogen usually comes from air separation. Producers liquefy air and then separate its parts by fractional distillation to obtain high-purity nitrogen; membrane and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems can also generate nitrogen on-site.[^5]

## Is Nitrogen safe to eat?
In the United States, nitrogen is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use in food.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also reviewed nitrogen as a food additive and found no safety concern at typical use levels, concluding no numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) was necessary.[^2]

## Does Nitrogen have any benefits?
Yes—its benefits are technological, not nutritional. By displacing oxygen, nitrogen helps keep oils from going rancid, protects aromas, and maintains crunch or tenderness during shelf life.[^4] It can also provide a gentle, fine foam in certain beverages without adding acidity, unlike [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide).[^2]

## Who should avoid Nitrogen?
For packaged foods that contain nitrogen in the headspace, there is no specific group that must avoid it. However, liquid nitrogen used at the point of service (for example, to flash-freeze desserts) can be dangerous if mishandled or consumed before it has fully evaporated; regulators have warned about burns and internal injury from direct contact or ingestion.[^6]

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “The bag is full of ‘air’ so you’re paying for nothing.” Fact: That “air” is usually nitrogen added on purpose to protect the food from oxygen damage.
- Myth: “Nitrogen adds calories or nutrients.” Fact: Nitrogen is inert in this use and adds no calories, taste, or nutrition.
- Myth: “Nitro drinks are carbonated.” Fact: Nitrogen makes much smaller bubbles than [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide), creating a creamy texture rather than sharp fizz.

## Nitrogen in branded foods
- Many snack brands note “packaged in a protective atmosphere” or “nitrogen-flushed” on the label or in product FAQs.
- Several major breweries and coffee brands sell “nitro” lines that use nitrogen to deliver a dense, creamy head and smooth mouthfeel.
- Fresh meat and ready-to-eat items may be sold in MAP packs, sometimes using nitrogen alone or blended with [carbon dioxide](/e290-carbon-dioxide).
