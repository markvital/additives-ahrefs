Formic acid (E236) is a simple organic acid used in small amounts to help keep certain foods and drinks stable and safe. It lowers pH and can slow the growth of unwanted microbes, so manufacturers sometimes use it as a preservative or acidity regulator where a strong, sharp acid is needed.

## At a glance
- Names you might see: formic acid, methanoic acid, or E236
- What it does: helps preserve foods and adjust acidity (pH)
- Typical amount: very small, because it has a strong, sharp taste
- Labeling: must appear on ingredient lists by name or as “E236” in the EU
- Dietary notes: not made from animal sources in modern food use; it’s produced industrially

## Why is formic acid added to food?
Manufacturers add formic acid to lower pH and help keep products safe and stable. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirms formic acid as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) for direct addition to food under good manufacturing practice, which covers uses such as acidification.[^1]

Lowering a food’s pH is a well‑known way to make it less welcoming to bacteria, yeasts, and molds. The FDA specifically regulates “acidified foods,” reflecting the role of acids in keeping shelf-stable products safe.[^5]

## What foods contain formic acid?
You may see formic acid on the label of some acidic foods and drinks, where it plays a role in tartness and preservation. On EU labels it can appear as “E236,” a designation tied to its official additive specifications.[^2]

On ingredient lists, look for: “formic acid,” “methanoic acid,” or “E236” (in regions that use E-numbers).

## What can replace formic acid?
Food makers often choose other acids or preservatives if they want a milder flavor, a different pH curve, or regional familiarity. Common substitutes include:
- Other acidity regulators: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid), [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)
- Preservatives used at low pH: [sorbic acid](/e200-sorbic-acid) or [benzoic acid](/e210-benzoic-acid)
- For baked goods: [propionic acid](/e280-propionic-acid) to help control molds

## How is formic acid made?
Today, food‑grade formic acid is made industrially. A common route is reacting methanol with carbon monoxide to form methyl formate, then hydrolyzing that to formic acid. It is also known in nature (for example, in ants and some plants), but commercial supplies come from chemical synthesis, not from animals.[^3]

## Is formic acid safe to eat?
When used as intended, regulators consider formic acid safe in food. In the U.S., it is affirmed as GRAS for direct addition to foods, with use limited to the minimum needed to achieve the desired technical effect.[^1] In the European Union, E236 has official purity specifications that food‑grade material must meet.[^2]

Concentrated formic acid is corrosive and can irritate or burn skin and eyes; those hazards apply to workplace handling, not to the tiny amounts used in foods.[^4]

## Does formic acid have any benefits?
Yes—its main benefit is functional. By lowering pH, formic acid can help extend shelf life and maintain product quality by slowing the growth of spoilage microbes. This role is consistent with established food safety practices for acidified foods.[^5]

## Who should avoid formic acid?
- People who find very acidic foods irritating (for example, those prone to mouth sores or acid reflux) may prefer to limit foods acidified with strong acids.
- Anyone with specific dietary advice from a healthcare professional about acidic foods should follow that guidance.
- As with all additives, if you suspect sensitivity, check labels and choose alternatives.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: Formic acid is the same as formaldehyde. Fact: They are different chemicals with different properties and uses.
- Myth: E-numbers mean “unsafe chemicals.” Fact: Many E-number additives are familiar substances such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid), assessed by regulators for safety.
- Myth: It makes foods extremely sour. Fact: Food makers use very small amounts to reach the desired pH without overwhelming flavor.

## Formic acid in branded foods
You’re most likely to spot it on labels that feature sharper acidity. In ingredient lists, look for “formic acid,” “methanoic acid,” or “E236” (EU). Many mainstream products use other acids instead, so you may or may not see it often depending on the country and product style.
