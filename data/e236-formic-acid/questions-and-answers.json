      "q": "is formic acid a strong acid",
      "a": "No—formic acid is a weak acid in water (pKa ≈ 3.75), though concentrated solutions are corrosive.",

    {
      "q": "what is formic acid used for",
      "a": "As E236, it’s used mainly as an antimicrobial preservative and acidity regulator (especially in animal feed and silage), and outside food in leather/textile processing, rubber coagulation, beekeeping, and as a chemical intermediate.",

      "q": "what does formic acid smell like",

    {
      "q": "what does formic acid do to the body",
      "a": "At low food-use levels it’s metabolized to formate and then to carbon dioxide, but concentrated exposure irritates and can burn skin, eyes, and airways; large ingestions may cause metabolic acidosis and systemic toxicity.",

    {
      "q": "does formic acid have hydrogen bonding",
      "a": "Yes—its carboxyl group donates and accepts hydrogen bonds, often forming dimers, which contributes to its relatively high boiling point.",
