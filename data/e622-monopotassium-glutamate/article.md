Monopotassium glutamate (E622) is the potassium salt of glutamic acid, the amino acid that gives foods a savory “umami” taste. It works much like monosodium glutamate (MSG), boosting flavor in small amounts and often used in low‑sodium seasonings.

## At a glance
- What it is: the potassium salt of glutamic acid, used as a flavor enhancer that adds umami.
- What it does: strengthens savory taste in soups, sauces, snacks, and seasonings.
- How it tastes: not salty by itself; it deepens meatiness and broth-like notes.
- Where you’ll see it: label names include “monopotassium glutamate,” “potassium glutamate,” or “E622.”
- Related additives: [glutamic acid](/e620-glutamic-acid) and [monosodium glutamate](/e621-monosodium-glutamate).
- Typical pairing: often combined with nucleotide enhancers like [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate) or [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate).
- Diet notes: contains potassium; people on potassium-restricted diets should take care.

## Why is Monopotassium glutamate added to food?
Food makers use monopotassium glutamate to deliver umami, the fifth basic taste. It activates the same taste receptors that respond to natural glutamate found in foods like tomatoes and aged cheese, making flavors fuller and more savory. It’s sometimes chosen instead of MSG when formulators want to cut sodium while keeping a strong savory profile.

Monopotassium glutamate can work in synergy with flavor nucleotides such as [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), or blends like [disodium 5′‑ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide), giving a bigger boost than any one ingredient alone.

## What foods contain Monopotassium glutamate?
You’ll most often find E622 in savory products, for example:
- Seasoning mixes and bouillon powders
- Instant noodles and soup bases
- Snack foods and coated nuts
- Frozen or canned ready meals and sauces
- Plant-based meat alternatives and some cured or processed meats
- Low‑sodium or “reduced salt” seasonings, where potassium replaces some sodium

## What can replace Monopotassium glutamate?
- [Monosodium glutamate (MSG)](/e621-monosodium-glutamate) or [glutamic acid](/e620-glutamic-acid)
- Umami-rich ingredients such as yeast extracts or hydrolyzed vegetable proteins
- Nucleotide enhancers: [disodium inosinate](/e631-disodium-inosinate), [disodium guanylate](/e627-disodium-guanylate), or [disodium 5′‑ribonucleotide](/e635-disodium-5-ribonucleotide)
- Mineral substitutes for saltiness, like [potassium chloride](/e508-potassium-chloride), often used alongside umami enhancers

## How is Monopotassium glutamate made?
Commercially, L‑glutamic acid is produced by food-grade fermentation using microorganisms that convert sugars or starches into glutamate. The purified L‑glutamic acid is then neutralized with a potassium source (such as potassium hydroxide) to form monopotassium glutamate, followed by crystallization and drying to meet food‑grade specifications.[^1]

## Is Monopotassium glutamate safe to eat?
In the European Union, monopotassium glutamate (E622) is authorized as a food additive in the “flavor enhancer” category, with specific use rules under EU food additive law.[^2] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated glutamates (E620–E625) and set a group acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, expressed as glutamic acid.[^1]

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that the glutamate in MSG is chemically the same as glutamate found naturally in foods and is processed by the body in the same way. Some people report short‑term, mild reactions to large intakes of added glutamate, but overall use is considered safe under normal conditions of use.[^3]

## Does Monopotassium glutamate have any benefits?
- Enhances savory taste (umami), making foods taste richer with small amounts.
- Helps formulators reduce sodium when used in place of some salt or MSG, because it contributes little or no sodium itself.
- Can improve palatability in products that are otherwise bland or very low in salt.

## Who should avoid Monopotassium glutamate?
- People on potassium‑restricted diets, such as many with chronic kidney disease, should watch their total potassium intake from all sources, including potassium-based additives.[^4]
- Individuals who notice they are sensitive to large, single servings of glutamate-containing foods or seasonings may choose to limit them and see if symptoms improve.[^3]

If you have specific medical conditions or take medicines that affect potassium balance, ask a healthcare professional about potassium-containing ingredients.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as gluten.” False. Glutamate is an amino acid; gluten is a family of proteins in wheat, barley, and rye.
- “It tastes salty.” Not exactly. Glutamate provides umami, which is different from saltiness; it can make salty flavors seem more satisfying even at lower salt levels.
- “Reactions are common.” Reports exist, but most people do not experience symptoms at typical food levels; reactions, when they occur, are usually mild and linked to large single doses, especially without food.[^3]
- “It only works in meat.” False. Umami also boosts the taste of vegetables, mushrooms, tomatoes, and broths.

## Monopotassium glutamate in branded foods
On labels, look for “monopotassium glutamate,” “potassium glutamate,” or “E622.” Brands may use it in place of MSG to keep sodium lower, or alongside other umami enhancers. Ingredient lists often group it with spices and flavorings in soups, snacks, noodles, bouillon, and seasoning blends.
