      "q": "how much potassium glutamate good for blood pressure",
      "a": "There’s no established dose of monopotassium glutamate for blood pressure—it’s a flavor enhancer, not a treatment; any benefit would come from replacing sodium and adding modest potassium (~210 mg K per gram). For BP control, emphasize potassium-rich foods and sodium reduction, and avoid potassium salts if you have kidney disease or take ACE inhibitors/ARBs unless advised by your clinician.",

      "q": "how much to take potassium glutamate supplements with lisinopril",
      "a": "Do not take potassium glutamate or other potassium supplements with lisinopril unless your clinician specifically prescribes it, as this combination can cause dangerous hyperkalemia. Small amounts in foods using E622 are usually acceptable for most people, but confirm with your healthcare provider.",

      "q": "potassium aspartate potassium glutamate potassium which is the best?",
      "a": "No form is inherently “best” for potassium; amino‑acid salts like potassium glutamate or aspartate offer no proven advantage over standard potassium chloride and typically provide less elemental potassium per gram. Choose a form based on medical guidance and tolerability, not marketing claims.",

    {
      "q": "what are sites similar to e622",
      "a": "Similar additives are the other glutamate flavor enhancers: E621 (monosodium glutamate), E623 (calcium diglutamate), E624 (monoammonium glutamate), and E625 (magnesium diglutamate). All work by supplying glutamate to boost umami taste.",

    {
      "q": "what do potassium and sodium glutamate have in common",
      "a": "Both are salts of glutamic acid used as flavor enhancers that provide the same umami‑active glutamate; they mainly differ in the counter‑ion—E622 contributes potassium (no sodium), while E621 contributes sodium.",
