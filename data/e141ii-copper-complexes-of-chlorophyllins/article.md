Copper complexes of chlorophyllins (E141II) are green food colors made by modifying plant chlorophyll and replacing its natural magnesium with copper. They give a stable, bright green shade and are usually sold as water‑soluble sodium or potassium salts called sodium copper chlorophyllin or potassium copper chlorophyllin.

## At a glance
- What it is: Semi‑synthetic green color made from plant chlorophyll with copper added
- Main role: Colors foods and drinks green; more stable than plain chlorophyll in heat and acid
- Where found: Used across many categories where a clean green shade is desired
- Also called: E141II, copper chlorophyllin, sodium copper chlorophyllin, potassium copper chlorophyllin
- Regulatory status: Authorized as a color additive in the European Union; regulated in the United States as “sodium copper chlorophyllin”

## Why is Copper complexes of chlorophyllins added to food?
Food makers use E141II to create consistent green shades that hold up in real‑world conditions. Natural chlorophyll can turn brown when heated or in acidic recipes, but copper‑chlorophyllin colors stay greener and are easy to use because the common sodium and potassium salts dissolve well in water.

## What foods contain Copper complexes of chlorophyllins?
In the European Union, E141 (which includes E141(i) and E141(ii)) is authorized as a color in a range of foods listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. Check that regulation for the exact categories and maximum levels allowed in each food type.[^1]

## What can replace Copper complexes of chlorophyllins?
- Plant‑based greens like spinach or parsley juice/powder (less stable, more flavor impact)
- [Chlorophylls and chlorophyllins (E140)](/e140-chlorophylls-and-chlorophyllins) for oil‑soluble or less processed options
- [Copper complexes of chlorophylls (E141I)](/e141i-copper-complexes-of-chlorophylls) when an oil‑soluble, lipophilic form is preferred
- Microalgae extracts (for example, spirulina extract) where allowed by local rules

Each option differs in shade, stability, flavor, and whether it is water‑ or oil‑soluble.

## How is Copper complexes of chlorophyllins made?
Manufacturers extract chlorophyll from green plants, remove the natural “phytol” tail to form chlorophyllins, and replace the central magnesium ion with copper. Neutralizing the color with sodium or potassium makes water‑soluble salts (sodium copper chlorophyllin or potassium copper chlorophyllin) suitable for beverages and other aqueous foods. Detailed identity and purity specifications for E141(ii) are set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^2]

## Is Copper complexes of chlorophyllins safe to eat?
- European Union: E141(ii) is authorized as a color additive. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated E141(i) and E141(ii) and did not identify safety concerns at the permitted uses and levels reported to the Authority.[^3] Purity specifications, including strict limits for contaminants, are defined in EU law.[^2]
- United States: Sodium copper chlorophyllin is listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) among color additives exempt from certification; its use is subject to the conditions in the Code of Federal Regulations referenced there.[^4]

Because E141(ii) contains copper, it contributes small amounts of this essential mineral. Very high copper intake can cause stomach upset and other effects; the National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides guidance on copper intake for the general population.[^5]

## Does Copper complexes of chlorophyllins have any benefits?
E141(ii) is added for color only. It does not provide vitamins or special health benefits at the levels used in foods. Any health claims would need to meet the rules of the country where the product is sold.

## Who should avoid Copper complexes of chlorophyllins?
- People with Wilson disease, a rare condition that causes copper to build up in the body, are usually advised by clinicians to limit copper from all sources, including food additives that contain copper.[^6]
- Anyone told by a healthcare professional to follow a copper‑restricted diet should check labels and ask about color sources when needed.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s a synthetic dye.” Partly false. The color starts from natural plant chlorophyll but is chemically modified, so it is considered semi‑synthetic.
- “It’s the same as chlorophyll.” Not quite. Chlorophyllins lack the natural phytol tail, and in E141(ii) the magnesium is replaced by copper, which changes solubility and stability.
- “It contains unsafe metals.” EU specifications set tight purity limits for metals and other impurities; products must meet these limits to be placed on the market.[^2]
- “It’s not allowed in the U.S.” Sodium copper chlorophyllin is recognized by FDA as a color additive (exempt from certification) under specified conditions.[^4]

## Copper complexes of chlorophyllins in branded foods
On labels, look for “E141,” “E141ii,” “copper complexes of chlorophyllins,” “copper chlorophyllin,” “sodium copper chlorophyllin,” or “potassium copper chlorophyllin.” You’ll most often see it in products that need a clean, bright green shade, such as mint‑flavored sweets, certain beverages, dessert mixes, sauces, and some processed vegetables. Exact uses depend on local regulations and each brand’s recipe.
