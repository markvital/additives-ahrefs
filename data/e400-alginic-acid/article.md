Alginic acid (E400) is a plant-based thickener and stabilizer made from brown seaweed. It helps foods stay creamy, hold water, and keep particles evenly mixed.

<!--more-->

- Also called/E-number: Alginic acid; E400
- What it does: Thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier, humectant (holds moisture), sequestrant (binds metals), carrier
- Common in: Ice cream, flavored milks and shakes, salad dressings, sauces, pie fillings, restructured foods (like pimento strips in olives), and some plant-based dairy
- Diet flags: Vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free

1) Why it's added to food
- It gives body and smooth texture. It helps keep ingredients from separating.
- It holds water to reduce weeping in fillings and sauces. It can suspend pulp or spices in drinks and dressings.

2) What foods it's found in
- Dairy and frozen desserts: ice cream, shakes, flavored milks.
- Sauces and dressings: salad dressings, barbecue sauce, taco sauce.
- Bakery and confectionery: fruit pie fillings, glazes.
- Plant-based foods: non-dairy milks and creamers, meat analogs.
- Pickled or stuffed items: helps form pimento strips used in olives.
- Note: Labels may list “alginic acid,” “algin,” or related salts like sodium alginate.

3) What are its alternatives
- Pectin (fruit-based), guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan, and gelatin (not vegan).
- Modified food starches can also thicken and stabilize.
- For home cooking, try pectin or xanthan gum for jams and dressings, or guar gum for cold drinks.

4) How Alginic acid is manufactured
- Producers extract it from brown seaweeds such as kelp. The seaweed is cleaned and treated to pull out the polysaccharide.
- The extract is acid-precipitated to alginic acid, washed, dried, and milled. It may also be converted to salts (like sodium alginate) for certain uses.

5) How safe is Alginic acid for consumption?
- Major regulators consider it safe when used as intended in foods.
  - FDA eCFR (GRAS listing). URL to be added by editor. Takeaway: GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.
  - EFSA re-evaluation of alginic acid and alginates (E400–E404). efsa.europa.eu. URL to be added by editor. Takeaway: Safe at reported uses; no safety concern at typical intakes.
  - JECFA (WHO/FAO) evaluation of alginic acid and its salts. who.int/foodsafety/jecfa. URL to be added by editor. Takeaway: ADI “not specified,” consistent with low toxicity.
- Shopping tip: Look for “alginic acid,” “algin,” or “sodium alginate” on ingredient lists.

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Alginate-based products are used in some over-the-counter antacids for reflux support. These are drug products, not foods.
- As a soluble fiber, it can add viscosity, which may help with satiety in some formulations. Evidence in foods is mixed.

7) When Alginic acid may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Large amounts may cause gas or bloating in sensitive people.
- If you have trouble swallowing or known gastrointestinal narrowing, avoid alginate tablets and consult a clinician. This applies to drug forms, not typical foods.
- If your clinician advised limiting certain fibers or additives, check labels for “alginic acid,” “algin,” or “alginates.”

Myths & facts
- Myth: Alginic acid is synthetic or plastic-like. Fact: It is a natural polysaccharide from brown seaweed. Source: EFSA re-evaluation (efsa.europa.eu; URL to be added by editor).
- Myth: Alginic acid is the same as MSG. Fact: It does not contain glutamate and is unrelated to flavor enhancers. Source: FDA eCFR additive listings (ecfr.gov; URL to be added by editor).
- Myth: Alginic acid contains high iodine and triggers “iodine allergy.” Fact: Food-grade alginates are purified and have very low iodine; allergic reactions are rare. Source: EFSA re-evaluation (efsa.europa.eu; URL to be added by editor).

Alginic acid in Branded Foods
- You’ll find it in some U.S. ice creams, flavored milks, salad dressings, pie fillings, and sauces. Many products list the related salt “sodium alginate,” which serves similar functions.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
1) Is alginic acid vegan?
- Yes. It is made from brown seaweed and is suitable for vegan and vegetarian diets.

2) Is E400 the same as sodium alginate?
- E400 is alginic acid. Its salts, like sodium alginate (E401), are closely related and used for similar functions.

3) Will alginic acid affect gluten-free diets?
- No. It is naturally gluten-free.

4) Can alginic acid cause stomach issues?
- Most people tolerate it well at food levels. Large amounts may cause gas or bloating in sensitive individuals.

5) How do I spot it on labels?
- Look for “alginic acid,” “algin,” or related names such as “sodium alginate.”
