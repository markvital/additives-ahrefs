Hemimorphite (E557) is the mineral name for a zinc silicate sometimes listed as a potential anti-caking agent. It is rarely seen on modern ingredient lists, and in many places other silicates have taken its role.

## At a glance
- What it is: A naturally occurring zinc silicate mineral also known historically as “calamine.”
- What it does: Acts as an anti-caking agent to keep powders free-flowing.
- How common: Rarely used today; other silicates are more typical on labels.
- Made from: Mineral sources refined into a fine, inert powder.
- Diets: Does not contain animal products; gluten-free by nature.
- Regulation: Authorization for use depends on local rules; only approved additives may be used in foods sold in those markets.

## Why is hemimorphite added to food?
Food makers add anti-caking agents to stop powders from clumping and to help them pour or mix evenly. In U.S. rules, “anti-caking agent” is a defined function for substances that reduce the tendency of particles to adhere to one another.[^1]

## What foods contain hemimorphite?
You are unlikely to find hemimorphite named on everyday labels. In theory, anti-caking agents are used in items like table salt, spice blends, powdered drink mixes, baking mixes, grated cheese, and instant soups. In practice, these products more often rely on other silicates or flow agents.

## What can replace hemimorphite?
When flow and anti-caking are needed, manufacturers commonly choose:
- [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide)
- [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate)
- [talc](/e553b-talc)
- [sodium aluminium silicate](/e554-sodium-aluminium-silicate)
- [aluminium silicate](/e559-aluminium-silicate)

The best alternative depends on the food’s moisture, fat content, and processing conditions.

## How is hemimorphite made?
Hemimorphite is a naturally occurring zinc silicate mineral that can be milled and refined into a fine powder suitable for industrial uses.[^2] In principle, similar zinc–silicate materials can also be produced by reacting soluble zinc salts with silicate sources under controlled conditions, then washing and drying the precipitated solid.[^2]

## Is hemimorphite safe to eat?
Food additive safety depends on identity, purity, and how much is used. In the European Union (EU), only additives that appear on the Union list may be used in foods sold in the EU, and they must meet detailed specifications.[^3] Those specifications, when established for an additive, include limits for contaminants such as heavy metals and set out identity and purity criteria.[^4] Always check your local regulations to confirm whether E557 is authorized for the specific food and use level in your market.[^3]

## Does hemimorphite have any benefits?
Technological benefits:
- Helps powders stay dry and free-flowing
- Improves dosing and mixing in manufacturing

Nutritional benefits:
- None. It is used for texture and flow, not for nutrition.

## Who should avoid hemimorphite?
- People following an additive-free or “clean label” diet may choose to avoid any anti-caking agents.
- Anyone advised by a healthcare professional to limit exposure to specific minerals or silicates should read labels and consult their provider.
- As with all fine powders, the main concern for workers is dust inhalation during handling, not dietary exposure in finished foods.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Calamine” always means the pink skin lotion. Fact: Here it refers to a zinc silicate mineral historically called calamine, not the topical mixture used on skin.[^2]
- Myth: It adds dietary zinc. Fact: Anti-caking silicates are used at very small levels and are not meaningful sources of nutrients.
- Myth: All silicates are the same. Fact: Food laws treat each additive separately, with its own authorization and specification where applicable.[^3][^4]

## hemimorphite in branded foods
It is uncommon to see E557 or “hemimorphite” on ingredient lists today. If it is used, labels may list either the name or the E-number (E557), depending on local labeling rules. You are more likely to see alternatives such as [silicon dioxide](/e551-silicon-dioxide) or [calcium silicate](/e552-calcium-silicate).
