Monostarch phosphate (E1410) is a “modified starch” used to thicken, stabilize, and help ingredients mix smoothly. It is made by adding a small number of phosphate groups to ordinary food starch, which improves its performance in many recipes and packaged foods.

## At a glance
- E-number: E1410; also called monostarch phosphate
- What it does: thickener, stabiliser, and emulsifier for smooth, stable textures
- Common in: soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, dairy desserts, dressings, and ready meals
- Regulatory status: permitted in the EU and U.S. as a modified starch when used under good manufacturing practice

## Why is Monostarch phosphate added to food?
Monostarch phosphate helps foods hold water, stay smooth, and resist breaking down during cooking or storage. These functions are why regulators list it among “food starch-modified” ingredients used as thickeners and stabilisers in many foods.[^1]

## What foods contain Monostarch phosphate?
You are most likely to see E1410 in foods that need a consistent, spoonable or pourable texture:
- Canned and chilled soups, sauces, and gravies
- Fruit pie fillings and puddings
- Yogurts and dairy desserts
- Low‑fat or reduced‑fat dressings and spreads
- Ready meals and reheatable dishes
- Some gluten‑free baked goods and batters

On ingredient lists, it may appear as “modified starch,” “modified food starch,” or “E1410,” depending on local labeling rules.

## What can replace Monostarch phosphate?
Other texture agents can be used, depending on the recipe and processing:
- Gums: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan), [pectins](/e440-pectins)
- Other modified starches: [oxidised starch](/e1404-oxidised-starch), [distarch phosphate](/e1412-distarch-phosphate), [hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate](/e1442-hydroxypropyl-distarch-phosphate), [acetylated starch](/e1420-acetylated-starch), [acetylated distarch adipate](/e1422-acetylated-distarch-adipate)

Choice depends on heat, acidity, freezing/thawing, desired mouthfeel, and whether the product is dairy or non‑dairy.

## How is Monostarch phosphate made?
Manufacturers start with edible starch (for example, from corn or potato) and react it with small amounts of phosphates, such as phosphoric acid or sodium/potassium phosphates. This adds phosphate groups to the starch molecules (monoesterification) and improves stability without heavy cross‑linking.[^1] The EU sets identity and purity specifications for E1410 within the group of modified starches, including how it is defined and what contaminants must be controlled.[^3] International specifications from the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) also describe permitted reagents and characteristics for modified starches (INS 1404–1450).[^4]

## Is Monostarch phosphate safe to eat?
Regulators in the European Union and the United States consider modified starches, including monostarch phosphate, safe when used as intended. EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) re‑evaluated modified starches E 1404–1450 and concluded there was no safety concern at the reported uses and use levels, and no numerical ADI (acceptable daily intake) was needed.[^2] In the U.S., monostarch phosphate falls under “food starch‑modified,” which is permitted for use in foods under good manufacturing practice (GMP), meaning only the amount needed to achieve the effect should be used.[^1]

## Does Monostarch phosphate have any benefits?
For food makers, E1410 helps:
- Keep sauces smooth through heating and holding
- Limit water separation (syneresis) in fillings and dairy desserts
- Improve texture in reduced‑fat products
- Provide more consistent results than native (unmodified) starch

These benefits make it a common choice in hot‑filled and retorted products, as well as chilled items that need a stable shelf life.

## Who should avoid Monostarch phosphate?
Most people do not need to avoid E1410. However:
- If you follow a medically prescribed low‑carbohydrate diet, remember that modified starches contribute carbohydrate.
- If you have food allergies or coeliac disease, check the source of the starch on the label (for example, wheat). Allergen labeling rules require declaring major allergens where applicable.

If you are unsure about your individual needs, ask a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Modified starches are synthetic chemicals.” Fact: Monostarch phosphate starts as food starch and is gently altered to adjust texture; it remains a carbohydrate ingredient used under strict specifications.
- Myth: “E‑numbers are unsafe.” Fact: An E‑number means the additive passed safety evaluation for use in the EU.
- Myth: “Modified starches aren’t digested.” Fact: Most modified starches, including E1410, are digested similarly to native starch during normal eating.

## Monostarch phosphate in branded foods
On packages, you might see it listed as “modified starch,” “modified food starch,” or “E1410.” It appears widely across brands in soups, sauces, ready meals, yogurts, pie fillings, and dressings. In gluten‑free or low‑fat items, it often helps keep the texture creamy and stable.
