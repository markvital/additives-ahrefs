Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (E385), often shortened to calcium disodium EDTA, is a food additive that binds metal ions. By tying up trace metals like iron and copper, it helps keep foods tasting fresh and looking bright for longer. It is approved in both the U.S. and the EU for specific foods and limits.

## At a glance
- What it is: A calcium–sodium salt of EDTA, a “chelating” agent that traps metal ions.
- What it does: Protects flavor, color, and aroma by slowing metal-catalyzed spoilage; helps other preservatives work better.
- Where it’s found: Common in mayonnaise, salad dressings, sandwich spreads, pickled foods, and some beverages.
- How it appears on labels: “Calcium disodium EDTA,” “E385,” or the full chemical name.
- Regulatory status: Authorized with strict use levels in the U.S. (FDA) and EU (EFSA).

## Why is E385 added to food?
It is used because tiny amounts of metals in food can speed up browning, off-flavors, and rancidity. Calcium disodium EDTA “chelates” (binds) those metals, so they cannot trigger these reactions as easily, which helps keep quality longer in products like dressings and spreads.[^1] Regulators list it as a sequestrant, meaning it ties up metal ions to protect food quality.[^1]

EDTA can also support other preservatives. For example, in drinks that contain both benzoate and vitamin C (ascorbic acid), chelating metals helps lower the chance of forming benzene, an unwanted by-product.[^3]

## What foods contain E385?
You’ll most often see it in:
- Mayonnaise, salad dressings, and sandwich spreads
- Pickled or brined vegetables
- Some canned or jarred foods where color and flavor need protection
- Certain beverages and flavor concentrates that include vitamin C and benzoates

In the U.S., these uses and their limits are set out in federal food regulations.[^1] In the EU, its authorized food categories and purity rules are set under the food additive law and scientific opinions.[^2]

## What can replace E385?
There are several options, depending on the recipe and the kind of protection needed:
- Acids that bind metals, such as [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or citrate salts
- Antioxidants that slow oxidation, such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Emulsifier–stabilizer systems that improve product stability, sometimes used alongside or instead of chelators
- Phosphates that can also sequester metals in some foods, such as [polyphosphates](/e452-polyphosphates)

No single swap fits every product. Food makers often combine tools—for example, a mild acid like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) with an antioxidant such as [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid).

## How is E385 made?
Manufacturers start with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), then neutralize it with sodium and calcium to form the calcium disodium salt. The process is controlled to meet food-grade specifications on purity, identity, and limits for unwanted metals and other residues.[^2]

## Is E385 safe to eat?
Food safety agencies have reviewed calcium disodium EDTA and allow it at set levels in defined foods. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists where it may be used and how much may be added.[^1] In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reevaluated E385 and concluded that uses at authorized levels are safe for consumers.[^2]

Toxicology and nutrition studies show it is only poorly absorbed from the gut and is largely excreted, which supports its safety at permitted amounts.[^4] Like many additives, safety depends on staying within the legal limits in each food.

## Does E385 have any benefits?
Yes—its main benefit is quality protection:
- Helps keep flavors fresh by slowing oxidation started by trace metals
- Helps keep colors stable in sauces and pickled foods
- Can reduce formation of benzene in certain soft drinks by binding metals that catalyze the reaction between benzoate and vitamin C (ascorbic acid)[^3]

These effects can also make other preservatives, such as [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate) or [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), work more reliably in complex foods.

## Who should avoid E385?
Most people do not need to avoid it when it is used within legal limits. However:
- People under medical care for mineral balance issues, or on chelation therapy, should follow their clinician’s advice, since EDTA can bind essential minerals at high doses.[^4]
- If you follow a diet that restricts specific additives, check labels for “calcium disodium EDTA” or “E385.”

If you think you have a sensitivity, discuss it with a healthcare professional and bring product labels to your appointment.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s an antimicrobial preservative.” Fact: E385 does not kill microbes on its own; it mainly binds metals to protect quality. Any antimicrobial effect is indirect, by supporting other preservatives.[^1]
- Myth: “It’s fully absorbed and strips minerals from your body.” Fact: It is poorly absorbed from the gut at food-use levels, and most is excreted. Safety reviews consider these kinetics when setting allowed uses.[^4]
- Myth: “It’s unsafe in all drinks.” Fact: In some beverages, chelating metals with E385 can help reduce benzene formation when benzoates and vitamin C are present.[^3]

## E385 in branded foods
You can often spot calcium disodium EDTA in mass‑market mayonnaise, salad dressings, and pickled products. Look for “calcium disodium EDTA,” “calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate,” or “E385” at the end of the ingredient list. Labels change, so always check the package you have.
