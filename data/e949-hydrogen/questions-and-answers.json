      "q": "what is a hydrogen bond",
      "a": "A hydrogen bond is a weak electrostatic attraction between a hydrogen atom bound to an electronegative atom (like O, N, or F) and another electronegative atom; it’s unrelated to E949, which is hydrogen gas used mainly as a packaging/propellant additive.",

      "q": "does hydrogen peroxide expire",
      "a": "Yes—household hydrogen peroxide (not E949) slowly decomposes to water and oxygen; unopened it typically lasts up to about a year in a cool, dark place, but after opening it’s best used within 1–3 months.",

    {
      "q": "is hydrogen water good for you",
      "a": "Hydrogen water is water infused with dissolved hydrogen gas (E949); it’s generally safe, but evidence for meaningful health benefits is limited and not conclusive.",

    {
      "q": "is hydrogen a metal",
      "a": "No—hydrogen is a nonmetal under standard conditions; as E949 it’s the colorless, flammable gas used as a food-packaging/propellant additive.",

    {
      "q": "does hydrogen peroxide kill mold",
      "a": "3% hydrogen peroxide can kill mold on hard, nonporous surfaces, but it’s less effective on porous materials like wood or drywall; use in a ventilated area and don’t mix it with bleach or vinegar.",
