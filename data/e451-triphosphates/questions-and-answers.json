      "q": "what is adenosine triphosphate",
      "a": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a biological energy-carrying molecule and not the food additive E451; E451 refers to inorganic triphosphates (e.g., sodium tripolyphosphate) used in foods as sequestrants and stabilisers.",

      "q": "what is adenosine triphosphate?",
      "a": "ATP is a cellular energy molecule, whereas E451 denotes inorganic triphosphate salts like sodium tripolyphosphate used in foods as emulsifiers, humectants, and sequestrants.",

    {
      "q": "what is sodium triphosphate",
      "a": "Sodium triphosphate (sodium tripolyphosphate, STPP; Na5P3O10) is the E451 additive—an inorganic triphosphate used to bind metal ions, retain moisture, and improve texture in foods.",

    {
      "q": "which of the following statements about inositol triphosphate is false",
      "a": "It’s false to claim that inositol triphosphate is E451 or used as a food additive; E451 is inorganic tripolyphosphate salts (e.g., STPP), not the cellular messenger IP3.",

    {
      "q": "what are nucleoside triphosphates",
      "a": "Nucleoside triphosphates (e.g., ATP, GTP) are biological building blocks of nucleic acids and energy carriers, not the E451 additive; E451 comprises inorganic triphosphate salts used as sequestrants and stabilisers in foods.",
