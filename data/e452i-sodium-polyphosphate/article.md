Sodium polyphosphate (E452i) is a group of long-chain sodium phosphate salts used to keep foods stable, moist, and smooth. You may also see it called sodium hexametaphosphate. It helps bind water, control minerals, and support texture in processed foods.

## At a glance
- E-number: E452i; also called sodium polyphosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate
- Roles: emulsifier, stabiliser, sequestrant (binds metal ions), thickener, and humectant
- Common in: processed meat and poultry, seafood, processed cheese, dairy beverages, and some drinks
- Works by: binding calcium and magnesium, improving water-holding and texture, and preventing haze
- Status: permitted in the EU and U.S. when used within regulations
- Safety: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) set a group ADI (acceptable daily intake) for phosphates; some children can exceed this with high intake of phosphate additives
- Who may limit it: people managing kidney disease or on low-phosphate diets

## Why is sodium polyphosphate added to food?
Manufacturers use sodium polyphosphate because it does several jobs at once. It binds metal ions like calcium and magnesium (this is called “sequestration”), which helps keep beverages clear and stops off-flavors or discoloration. It also improves water-holding and protein functionality, which helps meats stay juicier and processed cheese melt smoothly. These functions are recognized for polyphosphates as food additives. [^4]

## What foods contain sodium polyphosphate?
You’ll most often find E452i in:
- Meat and poultry products (for moisture retention and texture)
- Seafood such as shrimp or scallops (to help retain firmness and water)
- Processed cheese and cheese spreads (as part of the emulsifying salt system)
- Dairy-style drinks and some soft drinks (to control minerals and haze)
- Certain instant beverages and powdered mixes (as a sequestrant)

Use levels and categories vary by country. In the EU, polyphosphates (E452) are authorized across a range of foods, and EFSA has reviewed their exposure and safety as a group. [^1] In the U.S., their use in meat and poultry is permitted within limits and must be consistent with safe-and-suitable ingredient rules. [^2]

On labels, look for “sodium polyphosphate,” “sodium hexametaphosphate,” “sodium polymetaphosphate,” or “E452i.”

## What can replace sodium polyphosphate?
Alternatives depend on the job you need done:
- For chelation/mineral control: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) or [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- For moisture and texture in meats: other phosphates such as [pentasodium triphosphate](/e451i-pentasodium-triphosphate) or [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates), or non-phosphate binders like [carrageenan](/e407-carrageenan)
- For thickening/stabilizing: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [sodium alginate](/e401-sodium-alginate), or [pectins](/e440-pectins)

Each substitute behaves differently, so recipes often adjust pH and salt to match performance.

## How is sodium polyphosphate made?
E452i is produced by heating and condensing sodium phosphate salts (made from neutralizing [phosphoric acid](/e338-phosphoric-acid)) to drive off water and form long-chain “metaphosphate” structures. The result is a glassy, granular material with a range of chain lengths that dissolves in water and acts as a sequestrant and stabiliser. These manufacturing steps and specifications are detailed in EU additive standards. [^4]

## Is sodium polyphosphate safe to eat?
Regulators allow sodium polyphosphate when used as intended. In the EU, EFSA set a group ADI for phosphates (expressed as phosphorus) of 40 mg/kg body weight per day and concluded that overall exposure is generally below this level for adults but can exceed it for some children with high intake of phosphate additives. [^1] In the U.S., FDA lists sodium hexametaphosphate on its Food Additive Status List, indicating permitted uses subject to good manufacturing practice and relevant regulations. [^3] For meat and poultry, USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) allows phosphates within defined limits in the finished product. [^2]

## Does sodium polyphosphate have any benefits?
For food makers, E452i:
- Helps meat and seafood retain moisture and remain tender
- Improves melt and sliceability in processed cheese
- Keeps drinks clearer by binding minerals that can form haze
- Stabilizes emulsions and suspensions

These are technology benefits to the product’s quality, not health benefits to the consumer. [^2][^4]

## Who should avoid sodium polyphosphate?
- People with chronic kidney disease or those advised to limit phosphorus may wish to reduce foods high in phosphate additives, including E452i, because phosphate from additives is readily absorbed. [^1]
- Young children with high intake of processed foods can exceed the phosphate group ADI; families aiming to lower exposure can check labels and choose foods with fewer phosphate additives. [^1]
- If you are on a low-sodium diet, remember E452i adds some sodium; consider overall sodium from all ingredients.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium polyphosphate is the same as all phosphates.” Fact: It’s one member of the phosphate family (E452i). Others include [diphosphates](/e450-diphosphates) and [triphosphates](/e451-triphosphates), which behave differently.
- Myth: “It’s a bleach.” Fact: E452i is a sequestrant and stabiliser; it does not bleach foods.
- Myth: “It hides added water.” Fact: It helps proteins hold water for better texture, but added water and phosphates must be declared on the label, and use is limited by regulations. [^2]
- Myth: “It’s a nutrient supplement.” Fact: It contributes phosphate, but it is added for technology, not as a dietary supplement. [^1]

## Sodium polyphosphate in branded foods
You might spot it in ingredient lists for deli meats, marinated poultry, frozen seafood, processed cheese slices and spreads, flavored milk drinks, or powdered beverages. Look for “sodium polyphosphate,” “sodium hexametaphosphate,” or “E452i.” If you prefer fewer phosphate additives, compare similar products—some use alternatives like [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates), or gums such as [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum).
