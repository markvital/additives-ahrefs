      "q": "are carbonates soluble",
      "a": "It depends on the cation: the alkali carbonates used as E502 in foods are readily water‑soluble, while alkaline‑earth carbonates (like calcium or magnesium carbonate) are only sparingly soluble.",

    {
      "q": "what carbonates soda",
      "a": "Carbon dioxide gas dissolving under pressure is what carbonates soda; E502 carbonates aren’t typically used to carbonate beverages except when reacted with an acid to release CO2.",

    },
    {
      "q": "do bases react with carbonates",
      "a": "Not in a typical neutralization sense—both are alkaline; strong bases can shift bicarbonate/carbonate equilibria (e.g., convert HCO3− to CO3^2−) without releasing CO2.",

    {
      "q": "what carbonates water",
      "a": "Carbon dioxide carbonates water naturally (from geological sources) or by injection; E502 carbonates generate CO2 only when acidified, as in leavening systems, not on their own.",

    },
    {
      "q": "do acids react with carbonates",
      "a": "Yes—acids react with carbonates to form a salt, water, and carbon dioxide gas, which is how E502-type leavening agents release CO2 in doughs and batters.",
