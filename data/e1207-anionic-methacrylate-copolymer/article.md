Anionic methacrylate copolymer (E1207) is a film-forming polymer used mainly to coat food supplements. It helps tablets and capsules pass through the stomach before dissolving, so the contents are released in the intestine. In everyday foods, it is rarely used.

## At a glance
This additive is a specialist coating you’ll mostly see on supplement tablets and capsules.

- What it is: a high–molecular‑weight copolymer based on methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.
- What it does: forms an acid‑resistant “enteric” film that dissolves later in the gut.
- Where it shows up: solid food supplements (tablets, hard capsules, some beads); not common in regular foods.
- Label names: “anionic methacrylate copolymer” or “E1207”.
- Regulatory note: in the EU it has detailed identity and purity specifications and is authorised only for specific uses.

## Why is Anionic methacrylate copolymer added to food?
Manufacturers use E1207 to create a smooth, protective coating that resists stomach acid and dissolves further down the digestive tract. This enteric coating can protect sensitive ingredients, reduce aftertaste, and help control when and where a supplement releases its contents.

## What foods contain Anionic methacrylate copolymer?
In the EU, E1207 is authorised for use on food supplements in solid form (such as tablets and hard capsules) as a glazing or coating agent; it is not generally permitted for use in ordinary foods.^[Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, Annex II (Union list of food additives — conditions of use). — European Union. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/1333/oj][^2]

## What can replace Anionic methacrylate copolymer?
Other approved film-formers or glazing agents can provide similar effects, depending on the release profile needed:
- [neutral methacrylate copolymer](/e1206-neutral-methacrylate-copolymer) or [basic methacrylate copolymer](/e1205-basic-methacrylate-copolymer) for different pH‑triggered release
- [shellac](/e904-shellac) for moisture and shine, sometimes used for enteric-style protection
- [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan) for clear, oxygen‑barrier coatings
- [polyvinylpyrrolidone](/e1201-polyvinylpyrrolidone) or [polyvinylpolypyrrolidone](/e1202-polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) as binding/film-forming aids
- [hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose](/e464-hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose) or [ethyl cellulose](/e462-ethyl-cellulose) for controlled release coatings

## How is Anionic methacrylate copolymer made?
E1207 is produced by polymerising methacrylic acid with methyl methacrylate to form a large, stable copolymer. EU specifications set identity criteria and strict limits for residual monomers and other impurities to ensure consistent quality for food use.[^1]

## Is Anionic methacrylate copolymer safe to eat?
Within the EU system, a food additive is placed on the Union list only after a scientific safety assessment and when there is a technological need; E1207 is authorised under this framework for its specific uses in solid food supplements.[^2] Its EU specifications also cap residual starting materials (like monomers), which supports safe use when manufacturers follow good practices.[^1]

## Does Anionic methacrylate copolymer have any benefits?
- Helps protect acid‑sensitive nutrients until they reach the intestine
- Can reduce stomach irritation by delaying release for certain formulations
- Masks taste and odour and improves tablet swallowability
- Improves handling and appearance (less dusting, better shine)

## Who should avoid Anionic methacrylate copolymer?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic polymers may choose uncoated or naturally coated supplements.
- Anyone with a known sensitivity to acrylates should consult a healthcare professional before using coated supplements.
- As with all supplements, those with medical conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding people, and young children should use products only as directed by a clinician.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s plastic, so it must be unsafe.” Fact: Authorised additives like E1207 must meet strict purity specs and may only be used for defined purposes.
- “It blocks nutrient absorption.” Fact: Its role is timing, not blocking—properly designed coatings dissolve where intended so nutrients can be absorbed.
- “It’s the same as microplastics.” Fact: E1207 is a functional, pH‑soluble coating that is formulated to dissolve during digestion, not persist.
- “All methacrylate coatings are identical.” Fact: There are anionic, neutral, and basic variants used to fine‑tune where a tablet dissolves, such as [neutral](/e1206-neutral-methacrylate-copolymer) and [basic](/e1205-basic-methacrylate-copolymer) types.

## Anionic methacrylate copolymer in branded foods
You’re most likely to find E1207 on branded food supplements rather than everyday foods. Check the ingredient list for “E1207” or “anionic methacrylate copolymer,” as EU labelling rules require additives to be declared by name or E‑number.[^3]
