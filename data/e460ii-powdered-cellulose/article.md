Powdered cellulose (E460ii) is a purified plant fiber used to keep foods free‑flowing and stable. It adds bulk, prevents clumping, and helps thicken or stabilize recipes without changing taste or smell.

## At a glance
- Names: Powdered cellulose, purified cellulose; E-number E460ii
- What it does: Anti-caking agent, bulking agent, stabilizer, thickener, carrier
- Where it comes from: Purified cellulose from wood pulp or cotton linters
- Typical uses: Spice blends, instant mixes, grated or shredded products, bakery and meat applications
- Dietary notes: Vegan, gluten-free, not digested; counts as dietary fiber
- Regulation: Allowed in the U.S. and EU under good manufacturing practice

## Why is Powdered cellulose added to food?
Manufacturers use powdered cellulose to stop clumping, improve flow, and hold water so textures stay consistent. It can add body to low‑solids foods, help keep emulsions stable, and deliver a “bulk” effect with little impact on flavor. In the U.S., cellulose is affirmed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as an anti‑caking agent, bulking agent, and thickener when used in line with good manufacturing practice.[^1]

## What foods contain Powdered cellulose?
You may find it in:
- Seasonings and powdered mixes to keep particles free‑flowing
- Shredded or grated products to prevent clumping
- Baked goods and snacks to adjust texture and add fiber
- Plant‑based meats and processed meats for moisture control and firmness
- Dairy and nondairy desserts to stabilize texture

On labels, it may appear as “cellulose,” “powdered cellulose,” or “E460ii.”

## What can replace Powdered cellulose?
Possible substitutes depend on the job it’s doing:
- For anti‑caking or bulking: [microcrystalline cellulose](/e460i-microcrystalline-cellulose)
- For thickening or stabilizing: [xanthan gum](/e415-xanthan-gum), [guar gum](/e412-guar-gum), [pectins](/e440-pectins), or [modified starches](/e14xx-modified-starch)
- For water binding and texture in doughs and fillings: [sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)](/e466-sodium-carboxy-methyl-cellulose)

Each option behaves differently, so formulators match the choice to the food and process.

## How is Powdered cellulose made?
Powdered cellulose is produced from high‑alpha cellulose sources such as purified wood pulp or cotton linters. The raw material is cleaned to remove non‑cellulose components, bleached and washed to food‑grade purity, then mechanically milled to a defined particle size without chemical substitution.[^2] Identity and purity specifications for E460ii in the EU set limits on moisture, ash, and contaminants, confirming its source and composition.[^3]

## Is Powdered cellulose safe to eat?
Yes. In the U.S., cellulose is affirmed as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice.[^1] The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated celluloses, including E460ii, and found no safety concern at reported uses and no need for a numerical Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). EFSA also noted that cellulose is not absorbed intact and is largely not digested, though it may be partially fermented by gut microbes.[^2]

## Does Powdered cellulose have any benefits?
- Technological: It improves flow, prevents clumping, stabilizes textures, and controls moisture.
- Dietary: It contributes insoluble dietary fiber, which supports normal bowel regularity as part of a fiber‑rich diet.[^4]

It does not add meaningful flavor, color, or aroma, and provides minimal nutrients beyond fiber.

## Who should avoid Powdered cellulose?
Most people can consume it without issues. Those advised to follow a low‑fiber diet (for example, after certain medical procedures) should limit foods high in added fiber, including cellulose. If you have a sensitive gut, a sudden increase in fiber may cause gas or bloating; introduce fiber gradually and drink enough water. For personalized advice, consult a healthcare professional.

## Myths & facts
- “It’s sawdust.” Myth. Fact: Food‑grade powdered cellulose is purified plant fiber that meets strict identity and purity standards.
- “It’s a filler with no purpose.” Myth. Fact: It prevents clumping, stabilizes textures, and can add fiber while keeping taste neutral.
- “It’s synthetic.” Myth. Fact: The cellulose comes from plant sources; processing purifies and sizes the natural polymer without adding new chemical groups.[^2]
- “It’s unsafe.” Myth. Fact: Regulators in the U.S. and EU allow its use under good manufacturing practice based on safety evaluations.[^1][^2]

## Powdered cellulose in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “cellulose,” “powdered cellulose,” or “E460ii.” Placement on the list reflects its amount in the product. You’ll most often see it in dry blends, shredded or grated items, baked goods, and some plant‑based or processed meats for texture and moisture control.
