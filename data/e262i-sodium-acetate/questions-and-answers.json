      "q": "how to make sodium acetate",
      "a": "Industrial food-grade sodium acetate is produced by neutralizing acetic acid with a sodium base (such as sodium carbonate/bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide), then crystallizing—often as the trihydrate—and drying as needed.",

      "q": "is sodium acetate dangerous",
      "a": "No—at permitted food-use levels it's considered safe (e.g., GRAS in the U.S.; ADI not specified by EFSA); concentrated material can irritate eyes/skin and large intakes add sodium to the diet.",

      "q": "what is sodium acetate used for",
      "a": "In foods it acts as a preservative and acidity regulator, helping inhibit spoilage/pathogen growth (commonly in meats, snacks, and bakery) and also functions as a sequestrant; it can contribute a mild salt-and-vinegar flavor.",

      "q": "is sodium acetate soluble in water",
      "a": "Yes—sodium acetate (both anhydrous and trihydrate) is highly soluble in water and is deliquescent.",

      "q": "what is sodium acetate trihydrate",
      "a": "It’s the hydrated form of sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2·3H2O), a stable crystalline grade that dissolves readily and is widely used in the same food applications as the anhydrous form to supply acetate.",
