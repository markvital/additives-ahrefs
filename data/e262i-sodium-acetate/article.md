Sodium acetate (E262i) is a salt of acetic acid. It is widely used in foods to control acidity, help preserve freshness, and add a mild “salt and vinegar” taste. It appears naturally in small amounts during fermentation, and is also made for food use.

## At a glance
- Also called: Sodium acetate, E262i
- What it does: preservative, acidity regulator/buffer, sequestrant (binds metal ions)
- Typical foods: savory snacks and seasonings, sauces and dressings, breads and tortillas, pickled vegetables
- Taste: mildly salty, tangy (vinegar-like)
- Vegan and gluten-free: yes; it is a simple mineral salt
- How it’s made: neutralizing acetic acid (vinegar acid) with a sodium base, then crystallizing
- On the label: “sodium acetate,” “E262,” or “E262(i)”
- Related additives: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [sodium diacetate](/e262ii-sodium-diacetate), [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate)

## Why is Sodium acetate added to food?
Food makers use sodium acetate to slow the growth of spoilage organisms, especially in acidic foods, and to keep the food’s pH (acidity) steady over shelf life.^[1] It also adds a clean, tangy note that supports “salt and vinegar” profiles in snacks and seasonings.^[1]

## What foods contain Sodium acetate?
You’ll most often find it in:
- Savory snacks and dry seasoning blends
- Sauces, dressings, and pickled vegetables
- Breads, flatbreads, and tortillas
- Some processed meat and poultry items in the U.S., where it is listed as safe and suitable for specific technical uses^[2]

In the EU, E262 (sodium acetate and sodium diacetate) is an approved food additive in multiple categories as a preservative and acidity regulator, subject to the rules in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.^[5]

## What can replace Sodium acetate?
Depending on the job it’s doing, common substitutes include:
- For tangy flavor or acidity: [acetic acid](/e260-acetic-acid), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)
- For preservation in acidic foods: [sodium diacetate](/e262ii-sodium-diacetate), [potassium sorbate](/e202-potassium-sorbate), [sodium benzoate](/e211-sodium-benzoate)
- For buffering/acidity control: [potassium acetate](/e261-potassium-acetate), [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid)

## How is Sodium acetate made?
Food‑grade sodium acetate is made by neutralizing acetic acid with a sodium base such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, then crystallizing and drying the product (produced as anhydrous or as a trihydrate). Specifications and purity criteria for E262(i) are set in EU regulation.^[3]

## Is Sodium acetate safe to eat?
EFSA (the European Food Safety Authority) concluded there is no safety concern for acetic acid and its sodium salts (including E262) at current authorized uses and exposure levels.^[1] JECFA (the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives) assigned an “ADI not specified” for acetic acid and acetates, indicating low toxicological concern at normal use levels.^[4]

## Does Sodium acetate have any benefits?
- Helps keep foods fresher by inhibiting certain spoilage microbes in acidic environments.^[1]
- Stabilizes acidity (pH), which can protect flavor and texture over shelf life.^[1]
- Supports “salt and vinegar” style flavors without adding liquid vinegar.

## Who should avoid Sodium acetate?
- People advised to limit sodium should consider all sources of sodium in their diet, including salts used as additives like sodium acetate.^[6]
- Anyone who finds sour or vinegar-like flavors irritating (for example, with certain mouth or gastric sensitivities) may prefer to avoid foods that use it for tang.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “Sodium acetate is the same as table salt.”  
  Fact: Table salt is sodium chloride; sodium acetate is a different salt made from acetic acid.
- Myth: “If it’s in food, it must be synthetic.”  
  Fact: The acetic acid used can come from fermentation (like vinegar) and is then neutralized with a sodium base.
- Myth: “Preservatives always mean harsh chemicals.”  
  Fact: Sodium acetate works mainly by acidity control and the antimicrobial action of acetate in low‑pH foods.

## Sodium acetate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “sodium acetate,” “E262,” or “E262(i).” It most often appears in salt‑and‑vinegar snacks and seasonings, some sauces and pickles, and bakery items like tortillas. Availability and uses vary by country rules and by brand recipe.
