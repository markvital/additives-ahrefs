Adipic acid (E355) is a food acid that adds tart taste and helps control pH. It is common in powdered drink mixes, gelatin desserts, candies, and chewing gum.

At a glance
- Also called / E-number: Adipic acid, Hexanedioic acid, E355
- What it does: Acidulant for tart flavor; pH control; gelling aid in gelatin; improves texture stability
- Common in: Powdered drink mixes, gelatin desserts, hard candies, chewing gum, bakery fillings, sauces
- Diet flags: Typically vegan and vegetarian; gluten-free; not from animal sources; check product certifications

1) Why it’s added to food
- Main point: Adipic acid gives a clean, lingering tartness and helps set the pH. It also supports gel strength in gelatin desserts and can improve shelf stability.
- It dissolves more slowly than citric acid, so it works well in dry mixes and candies.

2) What foods it’s found in
- Main point: You’ll see adipic acid in sweet and tart products and some mixes. Check labels on powdered drink mixes, gelatin desserts, hard candies, chewing gum, frostings, fruit fillings, and some sauces or dressings.
- Shopping tip: Look for “adipic acid,” “E355,” or “hexanedioic acid” on the ingredient list.

3) What are its alternatives
- Main point: Other food acids can replace adipic acid depending on taste and process needs. Common swaps include citric acid (E330), malic acid (E296), tartaric acid (E334), fumaric acid (E297), and lactic acid (E270).
- Shopping tip: If you want to avoid E355, look for products acidified with citric or malic acid instead.

4) How adipic acid is manufactured
- Main point: Most food-grade adipic acid is made by chemical synthesis and then purified to high purity. A common route oxidizes cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone (“KA oil”) with nitric acid, then crystallizes and refines the product.
- Newer bio-based methods use fermentation to make precursors from sugars, but availability varies by supplier.

5) How safe is adipic acid for consumption?
- Main point: Major regulators consider adipic acid safe at approved levels in foods. The FDA lists adipic acid as GRAS when used as intended, and EFSA set an acceptable daily intake (ADI).
- Typical intakes from foods are well below the ADI for most people.
- Key safety sources:
  - FDA eCFR (21 CFR 184.1009 — Adipic acid): GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-184/section-184.1009

6) What health benefits (therapeutic uses) may it have
- Main point: Adipic acid is not a nutrient and is not used for health benefits. It can act as an acidulant and excipient in some tablets to aid stability or release, but this is a formulation role, not a therapy.

7) When adipic acid may be unsafe (contraindications)
- Main point: Most people tolerate normal food levels, but some may prefer to limit sour acids. People with acid-sensitive teeth or reflux symptoms may find sour candies and drinks irritating.
- In very large amounts (far above food use), acids can irritate the mouth or stomach. Follow serving sizes and vary food choices.

Myths & facts
- Myth: “Adipic acid is a preservative that kills germs.” Fact: It is mainly an acidulant for flavor and pH control, not an antimicrobial preservative. Source: FDA eCFR (21 CFR 184.1009) — https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-184/section-184.1009

- Myth: “All food acids are harmful.” Fact: Food acids like citric, malic, and adipic acid are widely evaluated and safe at approved levels. Source: EFSA (Food additives re-evaluations) — EFSA.europa.eu — URL to be added by editor

Adipic acid in Branded Foods
- You’ll most often find adipic acid in gelatin dessert mixes, powdered drink mixes, sour candies, and sugar-free chewing gums from major U.S. brands.
- It may also appear in frostings, fillings, and shelf-stable sauces where controlled acidity is needed.

FAQ — Top 5 questions
- What is adipic acid (E355) in food? It is a food-grade acid used for tart flavor and pH control. It helps set gelatin and stabilizes some mixes.
- Is adipic acid safe to eat? Yes, regulators like FDA and EFSA consider it safe at approved levels. Most people consume far less than the ADI.
- Is adipic acid vegan and gluten-free? Yes, it is synthetically made and not from animal sources, and it contains no gluten. Always check full product labels for other ingredients.
- What foods commonly contain adipic acid? Look at powdered drink mixes, gelatin desserts, hard candies, and chewing gum. Some frostings, fillings, and sauces may also use it.
- How can I avoid adipic acid, and what are substitutes? Choose products that use citric, malic, or tartaric acid instead. Check ingredient lists for “adipic acid,” “E355,” or “hexanedioic acid.”
