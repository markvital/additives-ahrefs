      "q": "is yellow 6 harmful",
      "a": "At approved food-use levels, Yellow 6 (Sunset Yellow FCF/E110) is considered safe by regulators such as the FDA, EFSA, and JECFA. A small number of people may have hypersensitivity reactions, and the EU requires a warning about possible effects on activity and attention in children.",

      "q": "is yellow 6 bad",

    {
      "q": "what does yellow 6 do to your body",
      "a": "It provides color only and has no nutritional function; most is not absorbed and is excreted, though gut bacteria can metabolize small amounts. In susceptible individuals it can trigger allergic‑like reactions, and some children may show small, transient changes in activity or attention.",

    {
      "q": "does yellow 6 cause cancer",
      "a": "Current evidence does not show that Yellow 6 causes cancer at permitted food-use levels, and regulators have not found it to be carcinogenic within established limits. Potential trace contaminants are strictly controlled to minimize any cancer risk.",
