Petroleum jelly (E905B) is a highly refined blend of hydrocarbons used in tiny amounts to make foods shiny and less sticky. It works as a glazing or release agent, helping sweets, nuts, and tablets keep their shape and finish. Regulators set strict purity rules so only food‑grade material is used.

## At a glance
- Names you might see: E905B, petrolatum, white petrolatum, soft paraffin.
- What it does: glazing agent, anti‑stick and moisture barrier on surfaces.
- Common in: coated confectionery, chewing gum, polished nuts or dried fruit, and the outer polish of food‑supplement tablets/capsules (use varies by country).
- Made from: carefully refined fractions of petroleum, then decolorized and purified to food‑grade.
- Dietary notes: petroleum‑derived (not animal‑derived); flavor‑neutral; used only on the surface in very small amounts.
- Regulated status: listed in the European Union (EU) with the E‑number E905B; detailed identity and purity criteria are set in EU specifications.[^1][^2]

## Why is petroleum jelly added to food?
Petroleum jelly is added to give products a smooth, glossy surface and to keep pieces from sticking together. It forms a thin, inert film that slows moisture pickup, helps coatings set, and protects delicate finishes during packing and transport. In some recipes it also serves as a processing release agent, helping food come out of molds or equipment cleanly.[^1]

Producers may use it alone or blend it with other glazing agents such as [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax), [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax), [shellac](/e904-shellac), [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil), or [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax), depending on the desired hardness, gloss, and melt point.

## What foods contain petroleum jelly?
Exact uses depend on local rules and brand choices, but you may find E905B in:
- Coated confectionery and dragees (to add gloss and reduce sticking)
- Chewing gum surfaces
- Polished nuts and some dried fruits
- The outer polish of food‑supplement tablets and capsules
- Release coatings for certain bakery or confectionery molds

In the EU, it is authorized as a glazing/release agent under the food additive framework; permitted uses and conditions are set in law.[^2]

## What can replace petroleum jelly?
Depending on the product and label goals, common alternatives include:
- Plant waxes: [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) and [candelilla wax](/e902-candelilla-wax) for hard, high‑gloss finishes
- Animal‑derived waxes: [beeswax](/e901-white-and-yellow-beeswax) (adds a softer sheen)
- Resin coatings: [shellac](/e904-shellac) for high gloss and good moisture resistance
- Other petroleum‑derived agents: [mineral oil](/e905a-mineral-oil) or [petroleum wax](/e905c-petroleum-wax)
Choice depends on melting point, hardness, gloss, vegan status, cost, and regulatory allowances.

## How is petroleum jelly made?
Food‑grade petrolatum is produced from specific petroleum fractions that are:
1) distilled and dewaxed,
2) de‑oiled, and
3) highly refined and bleached to remove color and trace aromatics.
Only material that meets strict identity and purity specifications—such as limits on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), defined melting range, and ultraviolet absorbance criteria—may be used as E905B in the EU.[^1]

## Is petroleum jelly safe to eat?
Food‑grade petrolatum is highly refined and intended for surface use in very small amounts. In the EU, it is listed as a food additive (E905B) and must meet detailed specifications designed to control impurities, including PAHs.[^1][^2] Safety evaluations by European authorities support its current authorized uses when manufacturers follow these specifications and use levels set in legislation.[^2]

In the United States, “petrolatum (white petrolatum)” is regulated for specified food uses under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules; only grades meeting identity and purity requirements may be used and only under the conditions stated there.[^3]

## Does petroleum jelly have any benefits?
- Product quality: adds gloss and a uniform finish to coated items.
- Handling: reduces sticking and dusting during sorting, filling, and packaging.
- Shelf life: helps limit surface moisture changes that can dull coatings or cause clumping.

These are technological benefits; petroleum jelly does not add nutrients or flavor.

## Who should avoid petroleum jelly?
- People who prefer to avoid petroleum‑derived additives for personal or “clean label” reasons.
- Anyone under medical advice to avoid certain surface coatings (for example, due to swallowing difficulties with highly polished tablets) should check product labels or consult a professional.

Allergies to food‑grade petrolatum are uncommon, but if you have a known sensitivity to waxy coatings, choose products without glazing agents.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “It’s the same as motor oil.” Fact: Food‑grade petrolatum is a different, highly refined material that must meet strict food specifications.[^1]
- Myth: “It isn’t regulated.” Fact: In the EU, E905B is listed as a food additive and subject to legal purity criteria and authorized uses.[^1][^2]
- Myth: “It’s eaten in large amounts.” Fact: It is applied as a very thin surface coating—tiny amounts compared to the weight of the food.[^2]

## petroleum jelly in branded foods
You’re most likely to see E905B on ingredient lists for glossy sugar‑coated sweets, chocolate dragees, chewing gum, polished nuts or dried fruits, and on some food‑supplement tablets and capsules. Usage varies by country and by brand, so always check the label.
