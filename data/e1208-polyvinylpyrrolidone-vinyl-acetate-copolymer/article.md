Polyvinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer (E1208) is a synthetic food additive used mainly as a film-former and binder. Food makers use it to coat and hold together tablets and capsules, especially in food supplements, where smooth coatings and moisture protection matter.

## At a glance
- What it does: film-former, binder, stabiliser; helps coatings stay smooth and protects sensitive ingredients
- Where it’s found: mostly in coated tablets and capsules for food supplements
- What it is: a copolymer made from vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate; a stable, non-ionic polymer
- Label names: “E1208” or “polyvinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer”
- Origin: fully synthetic (petrochemical-derived monomers)

## Why is Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer added to food?
Manufacturers add E1208 to form tough, smooth films that coat tablets and capsules, reduce dusting, and help tablets keep their shape during handling. It also acts as a stabiliser, helping formulas resist separation and protecting sensitive ingredients from moisture. In EU law, E1208 is listed as a food additive with defined purity specifications and functional roles, including use as a stabiliser.[^1][^3]

## What foods contain Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer?
You will most often see E1208 in food supplements, such as coated tablets and hard or soft capsules. In the EU, authorized uses and categories for E1208 are set in the Union list of food additives and related databases, which show it mainly in supplement-type products.[^2][^3]

## What can replace Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer?
Depending on the job in the product, common alternatives include:
- [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol) for water-soluble films and coatings
- [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan) for clear, edible films and capsule shells
- [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax) or [shellac](/e904-shellac) for glossy protective coatings

Each option has its own texture, gloss, moisture barrier, and processing needs, so the best substitute depends on the recipe.

## How is Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer made?
E1208 is produced by polymerizing two monomers—vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate—so they form one larger copolymer chain. Food-grade material must meet strict EU purity specifications, including limits on residual monomers and solvents, and defined physical-chemical properties set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1]

## Is Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer safe to eat?
In the EU, a substance can be used as a food additive only after a safety evaluation and authorization. E1208 is on the Union list of approved additives, and any use must follow the conditions in the authorization and the official specifications.[^2][^1] These legal limits and specifications are designed to ensure that, when used as directed, the additive performs its function without presenting an unacceptable risk.

## Does Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer have any benefits?
- Helps tablets and capsules swallow more easily by creating smooth coatings
- Protects moisture-sensitive ingredients, supporting shelf life
- Improves manufacturing by reducing dust and tablet chipping
- Can help mask taste and odor in supplement coatings

## Who should avoid Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer?
There is no specific consumer group that must avoid E1208 under EU food-additive rules. If you prefer to minimize synthetic polymers in your diet, choose products that use alternatives such as [pullulan](/e1204-pullulan), [carnauba wax](/e903-carnauba-wax), or [polyvinyl alcohol](/e1203-polyvinyl-alcohol). People with known sensitivities to related polymers in medicines should consult a healthcare professional and check labels.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E1208 is the same as wood glue.” Fact: While it contains vinyl acetate units, E1208 is a different copolymer made to food-grade specifications with strict purity limits.[^1]
- Myth: “All plastic-like additives are banned.” Fact: The EU allows only additives that have been assessed and authorized; E1208 is on the Union list with defined conditions of use.[^2]
- Myth: “Coatings are just for looks.” Fact: Film-formers like E1208 also protect tablets, help stability, and improve handling.

## Polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer in branded foods
You’re most likely to find E1208 on the labels of coated vitamin or mineral tablets and on capsule products marketed as food supplements. Look for “E1208” or the full name “polyvinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer” in the ingredients list. It is less common in everyday foods and more typical of supplement-style products.[^3]
