Sodium hydrogen malate (E350ii) is the monosodium salt of malic acid, the tart compound found naturally in apples and many fruits. In foods, it brings a smooth, long-lasting sour taste, helps control acidity, and can hold moisture as a humectant. It is one of the two “sodium malates” covered by the E350 number, alongside disodium malate (E350i).

## At a glance
- What it is: the monosodium salt of [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid); part of E350 “sodium malates”
- What it does: acidity regulator, flavor acid with a mellow sourness, and humectant (helps retain moisture)
- Common foods: flavored drinks, candies, fruit fillings and jams, baked goods, sauces, and desserts
- Label names: “Sodium malate,” “Sodium hydrogen malate,” or “E350ii”
- Dietary notes: adds sodium; people on low‑sodium diets should consider total sodium from all sources

## Why is sodium hydrogen malate added to food?
Food makers use sodium hydrogen malate to fine‑tune tartness and keep pH in a stable range, which can support flavor and shelf stability. It also acts as a humectant, helping products like soft candies and baked goods stay moist. In the European Union (EU), it is authorized as a food additive in multiple categories as an acidity regulator and flavoring acid.[^2]

## What foods contain sodium hydrogen malate?
You may find it in:
- Soft drinks, sports drinks, and flavored waters
- Chewing gum, gummies, and other candies
- Fruit preparations, jams, and dessert toppings
- Baked goods, fillings, and snack coatings
- Sauces, dressings, and savory seasonings

In the EU, sodium malates (E350) are permitted in various food categories under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, so exact uses and levels depend on the product type and national rules. Always check the ingredient list for “sodium malate,” “sodium hydrogen malate,” or “E350.”[^2]

## What can replace sodium hydrogen malate?
Alternatives depend on the taste profile and pH you need:
- Sharper tartness: [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid), [L‑tartaric acid](/e334-l-tartaric-acid), or [fumaric acid](/e297-fumaric-acid)
- Similar fruity sourness: [malic acid](/e296-malic-acid) itself
- Buffering without adding as much acidity: [sodium citrates](/e331-sodium-citrates)
- Other organic acids: [lactic acid](/e270-lactic-acid)
- Other malate salts: [potassium malate](/e351-potassium-malate) or [calcium malates](/e352-calcium-malates)

Food technologists choose based on flavor, solubility, sodium contribution, and how the acid behaves during processing.

## How is sodium hydrogen malate made?
Sodium hydrogen malate is produced by partially neutralizing food‑grade L‑malic acid with sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, and controlling the reaction so that only one of malic acid’s two acid groups is neutralized. This yields the monosodium salt (the “hydrogen malate,” E350ii) rather than the fully neutralized disodium salt (E350i). Specifications, purity criteria, and identity for E350 are laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012.[^1]

## Is sodium hydrogen malate safe to eat?
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re‑evaluated malic acid and its salts, including sodium malates (E350), and concluded there is no safety concern at the reported uses and levels in foods. An acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not considered necessary.[^3] In the EU, its use is regulated by category and maximum levels under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, which adds an extra layer of safety control.[^2]

## Does sodium hydrogen malate have any benefits?
- Taste: It delivers a smooth, lingering sourness that is less sharp than many other acids, which works well in fruit flavors.
- Texture and moisture: As a humectant, it helps retain water in soft candies, baked goods, and fillings.
- Processing: Its buffering action helps stabilize pH, which can improve flavor consistency and performance of other ingredients during heating and storage.

These are technological benefits to the food; they are not health claims.

## Who should avoid sodium hydrogen malate?
Sodium hydrogen malate adds sodium to the diet. People advised to limit sodium—such as individuals with high blood pressure—should watch total sodium from all sources and check labels for sodium salts, including “sodium malate.” Public health agencies recommend reducing overall sodium intake for cardiovascular health.[^4]

## Myths & facts
- “It’s the same as malic acid.” Not quite. It’s the sodium salt of malic acid, so it’s less acidic and more buffering.
- “All acids taste equally sour.” Different acids have distinct sourness profiles. Malates tend to taste fruity and smooth.
- “It only adds flavor.” It also helps manage pH and can keep foods moist.
- “E‑numbers are unsafe.” E‑numbers are simply codes for approved additives that meet strict safety and purity rules in the EU.

## Sodium hydrogen malate in branded foods
On labels, it may appear as “sodium malate,” “sodium hydrogen malate,” or “E350.” Some brands list the general term “sodium malates” for both E350i and E350ii. If you monitor sodium intake, compare serving sizes and scan the ingredient list for multiple sodium salts.
