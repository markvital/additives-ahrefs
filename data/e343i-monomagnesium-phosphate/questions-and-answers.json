      "q": "what is the formula for magnesium phosphate",
      "a": "For the food additive E343(i) monomagnesium phosphate, the formula is Mg(H2PO4)2 (often found as hydrates); the fully basic “magnesium phosphate” is Mg3(PO4)2.",

    {
      "q": "what does monobasic mean",
      "a": "Monobasic means only one acidic hydrogen per acid unit is replaced by a metal; in phosphates it refers to dihydrogen phosphate salts (H2PO4−), such as Mg(H2PO4)2.",

      "q": "what is magnesium ascorbyl phosphate",
      "a": "It’s a stabilized vitamin C (ascorbic acid) derivative used mainly in cosmetics and skincare; it is different from the food additive magnesium phosphates (E343).",

      "q": "what is the molar mass of magnesium phosphate",
      "a": "Anhydrous monomagnesium phosphate, Mg(H2PO4)2, is about 218.28 g/mol; the tribasic magnesium phosphate Mg3(PO4)2 is about 262.86 g/mol (hydrate forms will differ).",

    {
      "q": "why boric acid is monobasic acid",
      "a": "In water, boric acid B(OH)3 acts as a Lewis acid that accepts one OH− to form B(OH)4−, effectively releasing only one proton equivalent, so it is monobasic.",
