      "q": "why is saccharin banned",

      "q": "is saccharin bad for you",
      "a": "For most people, no—major regulators consider it safe within the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of up to 5 mg/kg body weight per day; some may dislike its bitter/metallic aftertaste, and evidence of any microbiome or glucose effects is mixed and not conclusive.",

    {
      "q": "is saccharin safe",
      "a": "Yes, when consumed within the ADI (up to 5 mg/kg body weight/day), it’s considered safe by bodies like EFSA, JECFA, and the FDA; past cancer warnings were removed after re-evaluation showed no clear human risk at normal intakes.",
