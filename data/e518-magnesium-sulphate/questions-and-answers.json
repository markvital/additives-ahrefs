      "q": "what do epsom salts do",
      "a": "In foods, magnesium sulfate (E518) acts mainly as a firming agent and magnesium nutrient; brewers also use it to adjust water chemistry, which can accentuate hop bitterness and support yeast.",

      "q": "do epsom salts work",
      "a": "Yes—at good manufacturing practice levels it effectively firms certain fruits and vegetables and supplies magnesium, and in brewing it reliably adjusts flavor balance and fermentation; it’s GRAS in the U.S. and authorized in the EU as E518.",

      "q": "how do epsom salts work",
      "a": "Magnesium ions cross-link pectins and interact with proteins to improve firmness/texture, while also providing bioavailable magnesium; in brewing, sulfate/magnesium in the water can enhance hop bitterness and support yeast performance.",

      "q": "what is magnesium sulfate used for",
      "a": "As a food additive it’s used as a firming agent in processed produce, as a magnesium nutrient supplement, and to modify brewing water chemistry; it’s permitted at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.",

      "q": "what plants like epsom salts",
      "a": "Plants showing magnesium deficiency—often tomatoes, peppers, and roses—may benefit because Epsom salt supplies magnesium and sulfur, but it offers little advantage in magnesium-sufficient soils and overuse can upset nutrient balance.",
