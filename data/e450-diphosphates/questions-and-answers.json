      "q": "what is sodium acid pyrophosphate",
      "a": "Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) is an E450 diphosphate salt used mainly as a leavening acid with baking soda and as a sequestrant to control color and prevent off‑reactions in foods like baked goods and potato or seafood products.",

    {
      "q": "what is tetrasodium pyrophosphate",
      "a": "Tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) is an E450 diphosphate salt used as a sequestrant, buffer, and stabiliser to bind metal ions and improve water retention and texture in foods such as seafood, processed meats, and some dairy products.",

    {
      "q": "is sodium acid pyrophosphate bad for you",
      "a": "It’s generally recognized as safe at permitted food levels; EFSA sets a group ADI for phosphates of 40 mg phosphorus/kg body weight/day. People with kidney disease or on phosphate‑restricted diets should limit phosphate additives, which can add to overall phosphorus intake.",

      "q": "what is adenosine diphosphate",
      "a": "Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a natural cellular molecule involved in energy transfer; it contains a diphosphate group but is not used as the food additive E450.",

    {
      "q": "what is pyrophosphate in food",
      "a": "In food, pyrophosphate (diphosphate, E450) refers to salts of P2O7 used as stabilisers, emulsifiers, sequestrants, thickeners, or leavening acids. Examples include sodium acid pyrophosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate, which help control leavening, bind metal ions, and improve texture or moisture retention.",
