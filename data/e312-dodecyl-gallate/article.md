Dodecyl gallate (E312) is an antioxidant that helps keep fats and oils from turning rancid. It belongs to the “gallate” family, alongside propyl gallate and octyl gallate, and is used in small amounts to protect flavor and shelf life.

## At a glance
Dodecyl gallate slows oxidation, which helps keep fatty foods fresh longer.  
You’ll mainly find it in fat-rich products like oils, shortenings, and spreads.  
It is made by joining gallic acid with a 12‑carbon fatty alcohol (dodecanol), and is typically produced synthetically.  
Ingredient lists may show it as “dodecyl gallate” or “E312.”  
It’s one of three related gallate antioxidants along with [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate) and [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate).

## Why is Dodecyl gallate added to food?
Food fats and oils react with oxygen over time, forming off-flavors and odors known as rancidity. Dodecyl gallate acts as an antioxidant, interrupting these reactions and helping foods keep their taste, aroma, and color during storage.[^1]

## What foods contain Dodecyl gallate?
You’re most likely to see E312 in:
- Vegetable oils and frying fats
- Shortenings and fat-based spreads (such as some margarines)
- Oil-rich snack foods and seasonings made with added fat

In the European Union, its use is authorized only in defined food categories and up to set maximum levels, rather than across all foods.[^3]

## What can replace Dodecyl gallate?
Depending on the recipe and regulations, common substitutes include:
- Other gallates: [propyl gallate](/e310-propyl-gallate), [octyl gallate](/e311-octyl-gallate)
- Phenolic antioxidants: [TBHQ](/e319-tertiary-butylhydroquinone-tbhq), [BHA](/e320-butylated-hydroxyanisole-bha), [BHT](/e321-butylated-hydroxytoluene)
- Natural-source options: [tocopherol-rich extract](/e306-tocopherol-rich-extract), [alpha-tocopherol](/e307-alpha-tocopherol), [extracts of rosemary](/e392-extracts-of-rosemary)
- Process helpers: [ascorbic acid](/e300-ascorbic-acid) or [citric acid](/e330-citric-acid) to help control oxidation in some systems

## How is Dodecyl gallate made?
Manufacturers typically produce dodecyl gallate by esterifying gallic acid (a naturally occurring phenolic acid) with dodecanol (a 12‑carbon fatty alcohol), then purifying the product. Chemically, it is the dodecyl ester of gallic acid.[^2] In the EU, official specifications define its identity and purity requirements for food use.[^1]

## Is Dodecyl gallate safe to eat?
Regulators assess both safety data and realistic dietary exposure before authorizing food additives. In the European Union, dodecyl gallate is on the Union list as E312 and may be used only in specified foods and within set maximum levels.[^3] It also has an EU specification (identity and purity) that producers must meet, which helps ensure consistent quality and safe use.[^1]

## Does Dodecyl gallate have any benefits?
- Helps keep fats and oils from going rancid, protecting flavor and aroma during shelf life.
- Can help foods keep their original color longer by limiting oxidation.
- May support product quality in storage and transport, which can reduce food waste.

## Who should avoid Dodecyl gallate?
- People who prefer to avoid synthetic antioxidants for personal or dietary reasons.
- Anyone who suspects a sensitivity to gallates should speak with a healthcare professional and check labels.
- Caregivers should always follow local rules for infant and young child foods, which often restrict many additives as a precaution.

## Myths & facts
- Myth: “E312 is a preservative against bacteria.”  
  Fact: Dodecyl gallate is an antioxidant. It slows oxidation in fats; it is not an antimicrobial.
- Myth: “All antioxidants are the same.”  
  Fact: Different antioxidants work best in different foods and processing conditions.
- Myth: “If a food has E312, it will last forever.”  
  Fact: Antioxidants extend shelf life, but they don’t stop all types of spoilage.

## Dodecyl gallate in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “dodecyl gallate” or “E312.” You’ll most often see it in fat-rich products like certain cooking oils, shortenings, margarine-type spreads, and snacks made with added oils. Many brands use alternative antioxidants instead, so E312 does not appear in all similar products.
