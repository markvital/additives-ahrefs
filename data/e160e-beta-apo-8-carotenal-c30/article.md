Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30), also listed as E160e or apocarotenal, is an orange to orange‑red color from the carotenoid family. It is added in tiny amounts to make foods look naturally orange, especially drinks, dairy, and bakery items. It is approved for use in both the United States and the European Union.

## At a glance
- What it is: A carotenoid color that gives foods an orange to orange‑red hue.
- What it does: Colors foods and drinks; it is fat‑soluble and blends well into oily or emulsified products.
- Where it’s used: Soft drinks, flavored dairy, desserts, spreads, sauces, and baked goods.
- Regulation: Authorized in the U.S. and EU; must meet strict purity specifications and good manufacturing practice rules.

## Why is Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30) added to food?
Food makers use E160e to give a warm, orange tone that consumers associate with orange, mango, peach, or cheese flavors. Because it is fat‑soluble, it disperses well in oily foods and in emulsions like dressings and flavored milk. In the U.S., apocarotenal is an approved color additive “exempt from certification,” and may be used in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice (GMP), which means only as much as needed to achieve the intended color.[^1]

## What foods contain Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30)?
You may find E160e in:
- Soft drinks, sports and energy beverages, and ready‑to‑drink teas
- Flavored milks, yogurts, puddings, and ice creams
- Margarine and spreads
- Bakery items, fillings, and frostings
- Sauces, soups, and instant noodles seasoning packets
- Confectionery and snack coatings

Label wording can include “E160e,” “apocarotenal,” or “beta‑apo‑8′‑carotenal.”

## What can replace Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30)?
Alternatives depend on the shade, solubility, and label style you want:
- Other carotenoids for yellow‑orange to red tones: [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene), [lycopene](/e160d-lycopene), [lutein](/e161b-lutein), or the broader group [carotenoids](/e160-carotenoids)
- Plant extracts with orange hues: [annatto](/e160b-annatto), [paprika extract](/e160c-paprika-extract)
- Brown/orange tones for certain applications: [caramel](/e150-caramel)

## How is Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30) made?
Commercial food‑grade E160e is manufactured by chemical synthesis, then formulated into powders, oil suspensions, or water‑dispersible emulsions to suit different foods. The EU sets detailed identity and purity specifications for apocarotenal, including permitted forms and carriers, to ensure consistent quality across products.[^2]

## Is Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30) safe to eat?
Yes—when used as allowed by law. In the United States, apocarotenal is a permitted color additive that is exempt from batch certification; manufacturers must use it under GMP and follow labeling requirements.[^1] In the European Union, apocarotenal (E160e) is an authorized color under the food additives framework, and it must meet the EU’s official specifications before it can be used in foods.[^3][^2]

## Does Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30) have any benefits?
Its role is technological, not nutritional. Key benefits to manufacturers include:
- Creates a bright, appealing orange shade
- Works well in fat‑containing foods and emulsions
- Can be blended with other colors to fine‑tune hue and intensity

## Who should avoid Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30)?
- People following a clinician‑advised diet that restricts color additives
- Individuals sensitive to ingredients in the color preparation (for example, certain emulsifiers or carrier oils). Check the ingredient list, since commercial color blends can include carriers in addition to apocarotenal.
- Those who prefer to avoid synthetically produced colors for personal reasons

## Myths & facts
- Myth: It’s the same as beta‑carotene. Fact: Both are carotenoids, but they are different compounds and can give slightly different shades. You can find beta‑carotene here: [beta‑carotene](/e160ai-beta-carotene).
- Myth: It’s a vitamin. Fact: E160e is used as a color, not as a vitamin source.
- Myth: It’s unregulated. Fact: It is specifically authorized and regulated in both the U.S. and EU.

## Beta-apo-8′-carotenal (c30) in branded foods
On ingredient lists, look for “E160e,” “apocarotenal,” or “beta‑apo‑8′‑carotenal.” In multi‑component mixes (like beverage bases or bakery premixes), it may appear within a sub‑ingredient list for a color blend. If you track gluten‑free, vegan, or allergen claims, also review any carriers or emulsifiers that accompany the color.
