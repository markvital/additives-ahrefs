Guidelines:
- Base your answer on the additive information provided by the user.
- Choose every identifier that clearly applies; omit ones that are not supported.
- If no identifiers apply, respond with an empty array.
- Use only the `value` identifiers from the list. Do not invent new identifiers or free-form text.

Respond with a single JSON object:
{"functions": ["identifier-one", "identifier-two"]}
