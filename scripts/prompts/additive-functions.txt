Determine the technological functions performed by a food additive. You will receive the Codex Alimentarius (GSFA) functional class names in a separate message; only choose from that list.

Guidelines:
- Base your answer on the additive information provided by the user.
- Choose every function that clearly applies; omit ones that are not supported.
- If no functions apply, respond with an empty array.
- Reply using the exact function names from the provided list. Do not invent new names or free-form text.

Respond with a single JSON object:
{"functions": ["Function name", "Another function name"]}
