# Claude Code - Task Management Approach

This project uses a task-based markdown approach for managing development work with Claude Code.

## Workflow

1. **Task Planning**: Create a markdown file in `_tmp/` with task checklist (e.g., `_tmp/featured_todo.md`)
2. **Execution**: Complete tasks one by one, marking them with checkboxes
3. **Commits**: Each completed task gets its own git commit
4. **Tracking**: Use markdown checkmarks (`- [x]`) to track progress

## Current Active Tasks

- Featured Widget Implementation: `_tmp/featured_todo.md`

## Guidelines

- Break down large features into small, manageable tasks
- Each task should be committable independently
- Keep task descriptions clear and actionable
- Update checkmarks as tasks are completed
- Commit after completing each task with descriptive commit message
